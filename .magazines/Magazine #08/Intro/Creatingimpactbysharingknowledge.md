**Creating impact by sharing knowledge; people first!**

We are proud to present the eighth edition of our XPRT magazine,
designed and written by the same people who are the driving force behind
the daily impact we create for and with our customers. Our magazine
represents that impact, ranging from helping organizations to adopt
DevOps in order to achieve digital transformation, to making
architectures more resilient by using robust patterns and unit testing.
Are you in control when experiencing turbulence in your production
environment? Read our article about Chaos Engineering to find out.

With each new edition of our magazine, we try to share as much knowledge
as we can, enabling as many organizations as we can to be more
successful by using new Microsoft technology. Did you know that quite a
large number of Data Science projects are executed without a valid ALM
strategy? The article "DevOps for Data Science" explains how you can
infuse your application with AI while still enjoying the benefits of
DevOps. What are you waiting for?

Later this year, we will be celebrating our first five years of Xpirit.
We would never have become what we are today without putting our people
first. The great thing about letting our XPRTs create their own magazine
is that a variety of topics get discussed, and this time these topics
range from sketch noting, DevOps and resilience to Xamarin and other
subjects. Enjoy!
