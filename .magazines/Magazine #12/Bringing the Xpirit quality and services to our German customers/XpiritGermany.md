# Introducing Xpirit Germany

*Xpirit is known for been an authority for Microsoft consulting --
covering DevOps and Cloud Transformation, Cloud-Native Development, and
Management Consulting. In October 2021, we started the journey of Xpirit
Germany -- bringing the Xpirit quality and services to our German
customers.*

In Germany we'll focus on the core Xpirit offerings: DevOps with GitHub,
Cloud-Native Development and Cloud Transformation. But we also plan to
expand our portfolio and establish new practices that are important to
our customers in Germany, like Microsoft 365, Managed Services, and
Low-Code development.

## How we work

With our main office in Frankfurt, we offer a 100% hybrid working
environment. To stay connected, we meet once a month in the office.

Our projects, customers, and members are located all across Germany. Our
members can choose to work in their home office or in a shared office
space we rent for them close to their home.

## Who we are

Our management team has many years of experience in Microsoft consulting
in Germany - helping their clients succeed in adopting the cloud,
developing enterprise scale applications, and implementing DevOps
practices.

Michael is responsible for the vision and execution in Germany. He is a
Microsoft Regional Director and Microsoft MVP, a book author and regular
speaker at international conferences. He has a strong focus on the
GitHub partnership, our Managed DevStack offering, and GitHub and DevOps
Training Services. Thomas is responsible for the technical strategy and
will also take care of the operational concerns. He is a Microsoft MVP
for Azure focusing on IoT, cloud-native development and artificial
intelligence. He's also providing training and consulting for GitHub,
DevOps, and Azure. Tobias takes care of clients, contracts, and
marketing. He's responsible for a healthy, intimate, and long-lasting
relationship with our clients and helping them by ensuring the delivery
of high-quality services from the entire Xebia Group.

We know each other for many years, and we trust each other blindly.
Doing "epic shit" has always been one of our key drivers and reflects
our DNA, together with the principles "people first", \"sharing
knowledge\", "quality without compromise", and "customer intimacy".

Although Xpirit Germany is in early days, our aspiration is to grow our
team to over 12 until mid of 2022.

## Why we are the perfect fit

The Netherlands embraced the cloud earlier than we did in Germany. But
now with the cloud transformation is at full speed and we believe that
we can bring a lot of learnings from the existing Xebia customer base to
Germany and help our customers succeed in their journey.

## What's in it for our clients 

With about two decades of consulting experience, we know that a
partnership to clients consists of trust and value. Therefore, we will
help, support, and consult with focus on pure, honest, and reliable
consulting. Clients can expect quality without compromise from us.
