# Introduction

I’m willing to bet that most readers will agree that a good product, feature, or solution means that end users are able to interact effectively with it – and that this successful experience is highly dependent on the people who create the solution. This means that those creators must interact effectively with each other--and the tools and technologies they use to do their jobs--to create the solution. Effective interactions in turn, rely on organizational structures and processes acting as enablers to getting the work done, not impediments. And the only way that we can design effective interactions to deliver successful solutions is by looking at the entire system that is used to create the product or solution. Otherwise, the solution runs a high risk of not meeting customer needs. The system I’m talking about is called the Value Stream.

The value stream includes the people, processes, tools, information, and the technologies that people use to do work and ultimately – if all goes as planned – create value for the customer. The value stream visualizes how the work flows (rather than what the work is). Imagine a feature being delivered to customers. This feature, and all similar work types, would go through various stages of being worked on before it gets into customer hands. With value stream mapping, we would map the various stages of work that work item goes through as it is being worked on, delivered, and maintained, rather than what each feature is. 

A value stream isn’t a process, but is a collection of processes and interactions that start with ideation and are complete when the customer receives value from the work that was done. In this sample organization, which is an insurance company, you can see what I mean. The gray bars are the internal departments, but if a customer wants to get something done such as file a claim and get their claim paid out, many departments internally would have to interact. That’s why you sometimes experience pain in your own customer experiences. It is usually due to a handoff somewhere along the way, where the company isn’t optimizing for your experience but rather their own internal structure.

Understanding the value stream & working to improve it is crucial. The biggest challenges occur across the system, between departments and people, which is largely invisible today because each department has its own metrics they measure. No one is tending to the value stream or overall system metrics. This gap can cause organizational performance to suffer and people to lose sight of customer needs in favor of their own siloed success.

# Benefits

Here are four ways that Value Stream Mapping can revolutionize the way you work and deliver exceptional outcomes.

1️⃣   Making the Invisible, Visible:
Software is a realm where much is invisible. Achieving a holistic understanding of the system can be challenging due to intricate build pipelines, complex processes, interpersonal interactions, and dependencies. VSM allows us to visualize the end-to-end process, uncover hidden constraints, facts, and assumptions, and identify areas for improvement.

2️⃣    Embracing Multiple Perspectives:
VSM brings together a diverse group of stakeholders. In a complex process, a single individual cannot possess all the knowledge of the system. By involving a variety of perspectives and people, we open the door to enabling collective intelligence to emerge. With multiple viewpoints at the table, we can uncover blind spots, challenge assumptions, and uncover novel solutions that may have otherwise been overlooked.

3️⃣    Achieving Alignment:
As humans, we tend to think our perspective on the system is correct and rarely challenge our assumptions. Bringing people together in one place to talk through what each person notices can help counteract biases and help everyone align on what they see as challenges. And when people are aligned on next steps, we're not working against each other.

4️⃣    Continuous Improvement:
Value Stream Mapping is not a one-time exercise but an ongoing commitment to continuous improvement. It provides a structured framework for identifying waste and optimizing the overall system. Through regular VSM sessions, we can track our progress, measure the impact of process changes, and foster a culture of continuous learning and growth within our organizations.

# Results & Outcomes I Have Experienced
After doing the mapping activity and taking action on the improvements identified, I have experienced the following results:  
 
 <li>	7-10x improvement in time to deliver work items inside teams 
 <li>	3-12x improvement in time to deliver new features to customers  
 <li>	70% reduction in support tickets and defects 
 <li>	At-risk projects delivered successfully & on time  
 
# Hearing from our clients

At Xpirit, we might start off our engagements and assessments with an interactive workshop, tailored for the problem and engagement needs. This can take the form of a value stream mapping or process mapping workshop, where the consultants and client get together, talk through the current system and its challenges, and envision a desired future state.

This gets everyone on the same page about the current system (oftentimes the end-to-end system and interactions have never been visualized before); aligns people on the challenges they face; and then we exit with a shared agreement of the top challenges and how to solve them. This might seem elementary, but few people (if any) would have this view of the system.

The feedback I received from some recent value stream mapping sessions summarizes what many people say after this experience:
“It felt very different than anything I have ever done before. I was leery before the session, but at some point during the workshop, it began to make sense. We need to understand where we are now, before we can improve. And we need to get out of our current thinking to get to where we want to be, so that we can make real improvements to our system. I enjoyed being a part of the session and it was worthwhile.”

I told him, “Yes! It’s also about alignment of the problems and solutions. You have been working in this system for a while. It exists for a reason. Without context or honoring why things are the way they are, we risk breaking the system. Plus, we will be working with you in order to accomplish our joint goals. What better way to make sure we all have understood the system and agree on next steps?”  

In another client, when the session was over and the people who participated were asked to provide feedback, one person said, “As a new manager, I thought that I was doing a terrible job. But now I see you all are struggling the same things that I am.” This conversation sparked the idea for a manager community of practice where they could share insights and help each other solve mutual challenges. 

# Starting your value stream mapping journey
 Value Stream Mapping can seem intimidating at first, for leadership, participants, and even a facilitator who is new to the activity!  
 
 Value Stream Mapping has four main parts: 
 
![Value Stream Process](./images/VSM-4-step-process.png)

## Step 1: Identify the Goals and Participants
The first step in leading and facilitating a future state value stream mapping activity is to define the scope and objectives of the activity. Identify the value stream that you want to examine and improve, define the boundaries of the process (start and end points), and set clear objectives for the activity. This is also the time to determine who would attend the value stream mapping activity. 
Select the appropriate team members who have the necessary knowledge and expertise to map the process. The team should include representatives from different departments or functions involved in each step of the process. 
## Step 2: Map the Current State 
Next, you should get to a whiteboard (physical or virtual!) and determine the various steps in the process. Create a “block” or use a sticky note for each one. There are many techniques to do this, but we suggest starting by anchoring the start of the value stream and the end; then working backwards where possible. The number of steps in a value stream are usually between 5 and 15. Use the 80% rule: don’t try to map exceptions, but stick to the main goal of the value stream. 
Once the flow is on the wall, review each step in more detail. Identify the wastes, inefficiencies, and bottlenecks in the process. Talk with the team about the average duration for each activity as well as the delays in between steps. You can leverage shapes in an online whiteboard, or sticky notes if you are in person. 
[Note: You might see complex symbols and fancy software if you look for an example online, but this isn’t really required.] 
Once you have mapped the current state, you should analyze the information to identify some of the root causes of waste, inefficiencies, and bottlenecks in the process.

## Step 3: Build the Future State Map 
Using the insights gained from analyzing the current state, you can then develop a future state map that represents an improved process flow. I walk the participants through a ‘happy future state’ visualization exercise that imagines their current system does not exist and they can start fresh. The future state map should eliminate waste, improve efficiency, and reduce the overall duration to deliver work items that provide value to customers. Build in some feedback loops so you’re able to validate that customers receive value from what’s being delivered.
## Step 4: Develop the Action Plan
Once you have developed the future state map, you should develop a plan to implement the changes needed to achieve the future state. This plan should include specific actions, responsibilities, timelines, and metrics to track progress.  Be sure to set regular review meetings after the conclusion of the value stream mapping to ensure that regular progress is being made on the actions that were agreed.  


## Conclusion

Understanding and optimizing the value stream isn't just a managerial responsibility; it's a collective endeavor that involves everyone from different departments and roles. By embracing Value Stream Mapping, organizations can gain a comprehensive view of their processes, from ideation to customer value delivery. The method makes the invisible visible, incorporates multiple perspectives, aligns team members, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement.

The real power of VSM lies in its ability to break down silos, offering a holistic system perspective that single-department metrics often overlook. It redirects focus from individual success to customer-centric outcomes. The significant improvements in delivery times, reduced support tickets, and successful project completions demonstrate its impact.

Starting your VSM journey may appear daunting, but the benefits far outweigh the initial apprehensions. By diligently following the four key steps—Identifying Goals and Participants, Mapping the Current State, Building the Future State Map, and Developing an Action Plan—you set the stage for sustainable improvements. 

In closing, Value Stream Mapping is more than a tool; it's a shift in mindset. It requires a commitment to scrutinizing and evolving your organization's processes continually. And as many can attest, the transformation is not just worthwhile; it's essential for any organization aiming to remain competitive and customer-focused in today's complex business environment.
