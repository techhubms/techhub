Is ChatGPT a Better Software Engineer than Me?

When Alan Turing proposed the idea of a machine that could simulate any
human intellect, he was met with raised eyebrows and skeptical chuckles.
Fast-forward to today, and we find ourselves surrounded by a veritable
army of digital masterminds that can do everything from ordering pizza
to mastering the ancient game of Go. The question now is, will ChatGPT
be the software engineer that steals our jobs or makes us better at
them?

**The March of AI Through History**

The AI journey began with the notorious Turing Test, which postulated a
machine that could imitate human conversation so accurately that it
would be indistinguishable from the real thing. The quest for such a
machine gained momentum during the Dartmouth research project in the
1950s, and today, we have five main types of AI: reasoning, natural
language processing, knowledge representation, planning, and perception.

Up until now, most AI solutions excelled in one area of intelligence.
But now we\'ve arrived at the age of ChatGPT, the multifaceted wonder
that combines reasoning, natural language processing, knowledge
representation, planning, and perception.

**ChatGPT: The Jack of All Trades**

ChatGPT isn\'t just your run-of-the-mill AI; it\'s a Swiss Army knife of
digital engineering. It can write application code, craft unit tests,
and create pipelines to build and deploy it all. In fact, it even
generates the infrastructure as code, leaving us mere mortals to wonder,
\"Is ChatGPT a better software engineer than me?\"

Let\'s have a look at certain strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT.

**Strengths:**

-   Inspiration: ChatGPT can generate new ideas, igniting creativity.

-   Empowering: This AI boosts productivity, equipping developers to
    tackle complex tasks.

-   Versatility: ChatGPT can wear many hats, from a programmer to a
    graphic designer.

**Weaknesses:**

-   Dreaming: ChatGPT might generate unrealistic or infeasible ideas.

-   Slow results: Sometimes, it takes a bit of time to receive useful
    outputs.

-   Confidence and reasoning: ChatGPT can be confidently wrong and lacks
    human-like reasoning abilities.

-   Biases: As with any AI, biases can seep in, affecting the quality of
    results.

-   Rudeness: On occasion, ChatGPT might be unintentionally impolite.

Despite these weaknesses, the consensus is clear. It is a great tool to
empower you as a developer. So, for now, the answer to the question \"Is
ChatGPT a better software engineer than me?\" is that AI probably won\'t
replace you. However, if you don\'t use AI tools, someone who does use
AI will replace you.

We can position AI like pair programming with an \"Experienced Expert
Junior Developer\". There is a lot of knowledge and information being
generated for you, but you still need to connect the dots and know when
it is right or wrong.

**Ask ChatGPT, Skip Google: Streamlining Your Search for Answers**

In today\'s fast-paced digital world, information is just a few clicks
away, and search engines like Google have long been the go-to resource
for answering questions and seeking advice. Unlike traditional search
engines, ChatGPT is designed to understand context, allowing users to
ask questions and receive relevant, nuanced, and human-like responses.
By engaging with ChatGPT, users can bypass the time-consuming process of
sifting through search engine results, while benefiting from
personalized and comprehensive assistance. So, the next time you find
yourself in need of quick, reliable information, consider turning to
ChatGPT.

Next, let's explore how to become an AI powered developer.

**Becoming an AI powered developer: the art of prompt building**

To get the most out of ChatGPT, one must master the delicate art of
prompt building. Just as an artist carefully selects their brushes, so
must developers fine-tune their prompts to elicit the most useful and
relevant responses from ChatGPT. An example of prompt building is as
follows:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| I want you to act as ... (job title, artist, role)                    |
|                                                                       |
| I will ... (give you x as input) and you will ... (what AI must do)   |
|                                                                       |
| I want you to ... (more context, limits)                              |
+=======================================================================+
