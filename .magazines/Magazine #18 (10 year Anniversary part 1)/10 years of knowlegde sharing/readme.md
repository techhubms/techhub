# 10 years of sharing knowledge
When we started Xpirit 10 years ago, we began with a mission and four company values. Our mission, "being an authority," says it all. We aim to be the best in our industry. Our company values support this mission: putting our people first, quality without compromise, customer intimacy, and, not least, sharing knowledge. And now, 10 years later, and being renamed to Xebia, this has not changed a bit! This article focuses on the last of these values because while sharing knowledge is easy to talk about, it is far more complex in practice.
In an everchanging industry like ours, how do you keep things engaging? How do you stay up-to-date and relevant? And how do you ensure your people remain motivated?

It would be wonderful if the ‚ÄúSharing Knowledge Recipe‚Äù could be laid out here in this article. After 10 years, we should have figured it out, right? But, unfortunately, it‚Äôs not that simple. There isn‚Äôt a single recipe, and if you think you‚Äôve found one, it often falls apart. Almost like Schr√∂dinger's cat. Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs cat is a famous thought experiment in quantum physics. Imagine a cat in a sealed box with a tiny bit of radioactive material. If it decays, it triggers a mechanism that kills the cat. If not, the cat lives. But until you open the box, the cat is both alive and dead at the same time. It‚Äôs only when you observe it that one outcome becomes real. It‚Äôs a strange idea, but it beautifully illustrates how uncertain and fluid things can be. Especially, as we‚Äôve learned, when it comes to sharing knowledge. Once you observe it, it changes.
So, rather than providing you with a recipe, a silver bullet, or a todo list to implement immediately, we want to share an overview of what we‚Äôve done over the past 10 years. We‚Äôll highlight what worked and what didn‚Äôt. But keep this in mind: sharing knowledge is deeply cultural. What works for us may not necessarily work for others. Still, we hope you‚Äôll find some inspiration.
Let‚Äôs start where everything should begin, with the *why*!
### Why Share Knowledge?

‚ÄúIn the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king,‚Äù or ‚Äúknowledge is power.‚Äù Sure, there‚Äôs a bit of truth in both, but let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre not exactly the best foundation for a modern, knowledge-based company. They‚Äôre built on the idea that a select few hold exclusive knowledge, and that can work for a while‚Ä¶ until those people leave. Then what? It‚Äôs something many companies have faced. And even more importantly, what about everyone else who wasn‚Äôt part of that inner circle?

In our industry, where change is constant and innovation never stands still, keeping up on your own simply isn‚Äôt realistic. You need each other. And learning has to happen in both directions: broadly and deeply.

But the real reason we share knowledge goes deeper than that. It ties into what we believe. If you want to be an authority, you need to know a lot. And if you‚Äôre surrounded by people who are passionate about their profession, they naturally want to share what they‚Äôve learned. Sharing helps you grow as a person, but more importantly, it helps the group grow. Because we don‚Äôt think in terms of individuals alone. We think in terms of teams, of people growing together.

That‚Äôs why we believe so strongly in the principle of "you grow, we grow." It‚Äôs something we actively support and nurture.

Sharing knowledge isn‚Äôt just about picking up facts or tips from others. It‚Äôs about fueling the growth of the group. And being part of that kind of collective growth gives people energy. It creates pride. It makes you thrive in your craft. And that, in turn, supports our mission of being an authority. Because we don‚Äôt just share internally. We also share externally. And when people outside the company see a team that shares openly and knows their stuff, that‚Äôs when you stand out. That‚Äôs when you become a true authority.

**Broad Knowledge**

Broad knowledge is about exploring things you wouldn‚Äôt find on your own. Everyone lives in a bubble, but fortunately, no two bubbles are identical. By engaging with others, you gain access to different ideas, interests, approaches, and perspectives. This interaction can spark innovation, inspire smart combinations, or reinforce existing ideas. Therefore, we don‚Äôt limit our knowledge sharing sessions to technology or only Microsoft. We share knowledge about hobbies people have, like farming or retro gaming. We share knowledge about how you can grow as a human, what you have learned from your coaches, or how to be more effective in conveying your perspective and convince people. The fact we share in so many areas makes it very diverse and engaging. You learn things you would never have imagined and while we share this with each other, you also make a better human connection.

**Deep Knowledge**

Deep knowledge, on the other hand, is about delving into a subject more thoroughly. You might already be an expert, but explaining a topic to others often leads to new insights. Think about explaining something to a friend that is not in your industry.  It forces you to think differently and approach the topic from fresh angles. And the seemingly ‚Äúsimple‚Äù questions that are asked might uncover aspects you hadn‚Äôt considered, giving you new paths to explore.
Sharing knowledge, therefore, is not just about giving. It‚Äôs also about receiving, even if it‚Äôs not directly related to the topic at hand. It enhances you as a professional and as a person, whether you are the one sharing or the one learning.
In an industry like ours, where innovation is relentless, a mechanism for sharing knowledge is essential to keep people engaged, curious, and up to date. Without it, you risk losing your edge and eventually becoming obsolete.

### The How and What of Knowledge Sharing

Now, let‚Äôs delve into the next topic: what is knowledge sharing, and how do you do it? What do you actually share? As mentioned earlier, knowledge is something you know. It can be deeply technical, a unique perspective, an insightful question, or even a combination of these elements. It could relate to a new technology, a book you‚Äôve read, or the connection between the two. Ultimately, knowledge sharing always involves both giving and receiving information.
There are countless ways to share knowledge, and it can be directed at different audiences. To understand this better, let‚Äôs first make an important distinction between **internal** and **external** knowledge sharing and explore what we at Xebia have done in both areas.
We‚Äôll start with external knowledge sharing, the most visible form of sharing for those who don‚Äôt work with us (yet üòâ).

### External Knowledge Sharing

If you‚Äôre familiar with us, you know we share knowledge worldwide. From national and international conferences to meetups, hackathons, and groups both big and small, many of our colleagues love sharing their stories with an audience. For us, this is crucial. It aligns with our mission to be an authority. We share what we know with others, and we‚Äôre fortunate to have many people who are passionate about doing this.
By supporting these individuals and giving them the time and freedom to speak at conferences, we achieve several critical goals. First, our people stay motivated to dive into new topics, improve themselves, and pursue our authority mission. Second, our presence at these events demonstrates to other companies that we have experts who truly know their stuff, which enhances our reputation. Third, individuals who share our ambitions and values recognize us as a potential employer. It‚Äôs a win-win-win situation that makes everyone happier.
Another significant way we share knowledge externally is through **writing**. Just like the writing of this article. The same principles apply as with speaking: when you need to explain what you know to others, it transforms into a completely different experience. Things you ‚Äújust know‚Äù must be articulated more clearly, which sharpens your understanding. Writing remains a powerful way to convey deeper messages, enhanced with code samples, illustrations, and visuals. It‚Äôs a refreshing alternative to the quick video snippets that dominate today‚Äôs content landscape.

We also host **hackathons and workshops**. Take, for example, an event like the [Global DevOps Experience](https://globaldevexperience.com/). An event around DevOps, Azure, GitHub and AI that can be hosted by communities all around the world. By creating this fully realized, out-of-the-box community event that others can host worldwide, we expand our reach significantly. The energy, excitement, and engagement generated internally while organizing these events are priceless. Just as importantly, we learn a great deal ourselves during the process and share that knowledge with one another. For instance, when planning such events, we aim to incorporate technologies we haven‚Äôt used before so we can experiment, learn, and grow.
Finally, another approach to external knowledge sharing, especially with our customers and prospects, is what we call **Pure Consultancy**. This involves sharing everything we know with clients, even if they haven‚Äôt signed a contract yet. We believe that immediately offering help and discarding the old notion that ‚Äúknowledge is power‚Äù fosters stronger relationships. And yes, if a customer finds what they need in a short conversation and doesn‚Äôt require further business with us, we‚Äôre perfectly okay with that. This open approach builds trust and sets the foundation for meaningful collaborations.
## Internal Knowledge Sharing
While external knowledge sharing is highly visible and contributes significantly to our mission of becoming an authority, it is only possible because of the strong foundation of internal knowledge sharing. At Xebia, this culture is embedded in our DNA, starting right from the hiring process.
During the hiring process, we discuss candidates' perspectives on knowledge sharing, their mission of authority, and their favorite topic, both professional and personal. This isn‚Äôt limited to work-related subjects. Many of our team members share knowledge about hobbies like cooking or bouldering. Learning from diverse perspectives opens up a whole new spectrum of possibilities and fosters creativity.
However, this culture doesn‚Äôt develop automatically. Over the years, we‚Äôve put in place several **facilities**, **events**, and **ceremonies** to nurture and sustain it.

### **Facilities for Knowledge Sharing**
We believe sharing knowledge should be as seamless as possible. That‚Äôs why every meeting room is equipped with whiteboards, sticky notes, and markers. Relaxed seating areas and phone booths are readily available, ensuring the environment supports open communication. In our culture, face-to-face discussions are prioritized. At any moment of the day. Because it is these 1 on 1 conversation that enable the sharing of tacit knowledge. Where "knowledge" includes anything you can explain, write down or teach, like facts or instructions, tacit knowledge is a subtler form of it: personal, experience-based and hard to express, often learned by doing rather than explaining. And the abundance of tools and accessible spaces are there to facilitate that and eliminate any barriers for discussions or brainstorms.
And what is the result in our office? If someone is using a meeting room for a remote call, it‚Äôs common practice to gently redirect them to a phone booth so the space can be used for collaboration.

### **Internal Events and Ceremonies**
Over the years, we‚Äôve developed several internal rituals to continuously improve and learn from each other:
**1. Relive the Dream, Offsite, and Retrospectives**
We begin each year with a ‚ÄúRelive the Dream‚Äù session, where we align ambitions, revisit personal and team goals, and discuss what‚Äôs needed for success. At the year‚Äôs end, we hold a retrospective to share lessons learned and celebrate our successes.
Midway through the year, we organize a two-day **offsite** where the entire team gathers at an external location. These sessions focus on building connections, sharing personal stories, and developing both team and individual strengths.
But you might wonder. How is this knowledge sharing? It absolutely is! These sessions build trust and connection. Without trust and psychological safety, sharing knowledge becomes difficult. Sharing knowledge can feel vulnerable: What if someone knows better? What if a question arises you can‚Äôt answer? Or what if a discussion leads to conflict? That‚Äôs why creating a safe environment is crucial for fostering a knowledge-sharing culture.

**2. XKE and XMS Tuesdays**
While some companies organize quarterly knowledge-sharing sessions, we take it a step further and do it weekly.
- **XKE (Xebia Knowledge Exchange):** Every two weeks, we host this event. Some kind of mini-conference where colleagues from across Xebia propose sessions on various topics. Attendees can pick and choose sessions based on their interests, enabling a continuous exchange of ideas and expertise.
- **XMS Tuesdays:** On alternate Tuesdays, we narrow the focus to our Microsoft Service Line. These evenings are spent brainstorming, presenting sessions, mob programming, or simply engaging in informal discussions.

These weekly events ensure that learning and collaboration never stop.
---
Internal knowledge sharing is at the heart of everything we do. It creates a supportive environment, encourages curiosity, and ensures we continuously improve. Not just as individuals, but as a team and an organization. By fostering this culture, we remain at the forefront of innovation and set ourselves apart as a true authority in the industry.
**3. Innovation Days**
Every quarter, we dedicate a full day to **Innovation Days**. During this time, employees can pick and choose any project they like, as long as it‚Äôs not for a customer and has an innovative aspect. The term ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù is broad. It simply means something that‚Äôs new or challenging for you personally.
Typically, groups form around ideas or problems people want to explore but haven‚Äôt had the time to address during customer projects. These days serve two key purposes: strengthening social connections with colleagues and experimenting with new, often untested ideas. Failure is common, but it‚Äôs part of the process, and the lessons learned often spark further creativity and growth. And when you failed in your goals that day, that is not a reason not to share, it is the reason you do share, so others can learn from the failures and we collectively know more on how not to approach a certain problem or technology!

### What Works and What Doesn‚Äôt Work
Over the past 10 years, we‚Äôve implemented numerous initiatives to support knowledge sharing. The practices described earlier in this article are the ones that continue to work well for us as a company. However, we‚Äôve also experimented with approaches that didn‚Äôt deliver the desired results and were eventually dropped. Here are a few examples:
---
### **What Didn‚Äôt Work**
**Remote XKEs**
During COVID, we attempted to replicate the in-office XKE (Xebia Knowledge Exchange) experience in a virtual format. It didn‚Äôt resonate with people. We realized that the social aspect of these sessions is just as important as the content, and the lack of face-to-face interaction reduced the overall experience. When you are already a remote-first company, this is different. Knowledge sharing happens online, but moving in-person sessions to a remote only or hybrid sessions was very hard.

**Focusing the Fire**

We tried to concentrate our knowledge-sharing efforts each quarter around a limited number of topics. This approach backfired, as people lost interest when they weren‚Äôt enthusiastic about the chosen topics. Allowing freedom of choice is essential for engagement. One thing we learned is you cannot govern where people's interests lie. And you are also missing out on ideas that you would not have thought of. This is one of those things that comes so naturally when you grow as a company, but we learned to embrace the abundance of ideas and topics to share knowledge about and learned not to govern them. Empower people to share whatever they want and you will see more energy and enthusiasm.

**Themed Innovation Days**
We organized innovation days centered on specific themes. While some people enjoyed these events, others ignored the themes and worked on projects they found more interesting. Once again, we learned that giving people autonomy yields better results. One of our big lessons here was that by theming your innovation days, you again try to govern innovation, while innovation comes from places you least expect it. By not freely letting it flow, you restrict innovation, and you restrict what you can collectively learn. 


**Themed Magazines**
We also experimented with publishing magazines focused on a single theme. This, too, proved difficult, as contributors struggled with the restrictions. That‚Äôs why we now encourage everyone to write about topics they are genuinely passionate about.
---

### **Summary**
Over the last decade, we‚Äôve built our company around the principle of knowledge sharing. By encouraging a strong knowledge-sharing culture and motivating all employees, both existing and new, to participate actively, we‚Äôve established a core pillar for a successful engineering culture.

We‚Äôve learned that flexibility, autonomy, and a focus on the social and collaborative aspects are key to sustaining this culture. Sharing knowledge remains essential to who we are, and we‚Äôre committed to continuing and evolving these practices over the next 10 years and beyond.
