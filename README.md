# Tech Hub

> **Status**: 🚧 In Development

Tech Hub is a **modern .NET web application** built with Blazor that serves as a technical content hub. We're creating a fast, responsive, accessible platform for showcasing Microsoft technical content across AI, Azure, GitHub Copilot, .NET, DevOps, and Security topics.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using VS Code F5 debugging or the `Run` script.

See **[docs/running-and-testing.md](docs/running-and-testing.md)** for detailed running, docker, and testing instructions.

## Project Documentation

We follow a structured documentation strategy:

- **README.md**: Provides high-level project overview and running instructions.
- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)**: Defines the mandatory AI workflow and development rules.
- **Domain AGENTS.md**: Located in subdirectories and even sub-subdirectories, defining local patterns and conventions.
- **[docs/](docs/)**: Contains functional documentation describing system behavior, architecture, and specifications.
