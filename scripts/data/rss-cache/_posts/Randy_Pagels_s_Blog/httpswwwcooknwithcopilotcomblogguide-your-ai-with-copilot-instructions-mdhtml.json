By placing this file at the root of your repo, you can guide GitHub Copilot with project specific rules, so it generates suggestions that fit your team’s standards automatically.\n\nProTip\n\n**Set the Ground Rules Once, Then Let GitHub Copilot Follow Them**\n\nInstead of reminding GitHub Copilot in every prompt, define your preferences once in `copilot-instructions.md` .\n\nCopilot reads the file for context when making suggestions.\n\nTry These Approaches\n\n**1️⃣ Standardize Naming Conventions**\n\n`# copilot-instructions.mdUse camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, and ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES for constants.`\n\nGitHub Copilot will generate names that match the pattern, reducing cleanup later.\n\n**2️⃣ Document Style Choices**\n\n`# copilot-instructions.mdUse JSDoc format for function documentation. Each function must include parameters, return type, and one example.`\n\nCopilot will produce docstrings in the right style without you prompting each time.\n\n**3️⃣ Add Security or Performance Notes**\n\n`# copilot-instructions.mdNever log sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or tokens. Always use async/await for database calls.`\n\nHelps prevent risky or outdated patterns from creeping into code.\n\n🔑 Now That You’ve Created Instructions: How to Apply Them\n\n- Place `copilot-instructions.md`\nin the `.github` folder at the root of your repo. Copilot automatically considers it for completions in that repository.\n- If you update the file, Copilot follows the new rules the next time it generates code.\n- You can combine `copilot-instructions.md`\nwith `.prompt.md` to guide both style rules and task specific prompts.\n\nExtra Ideas to Try\n\n- Define test frameworks, “Use Jest for unit tests with describe and it blocks.”\n- Add formatting preferences, “Use 2 spaces for indentation, no semicolons in JavaScript.”\n- Specify domain conventions, “For React components, always use function components with hooks.”\n\nQuick Takeaway\n\nThe `copilot-instructions.md` file is like a style guide that GitHub Copilot actually listens to.\n\nDefine your rules once, drop the file into your repo, and Copilot will follow them automatically.",
