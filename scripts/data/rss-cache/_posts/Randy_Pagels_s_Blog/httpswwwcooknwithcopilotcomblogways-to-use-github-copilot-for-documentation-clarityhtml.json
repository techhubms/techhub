Whether you need quick docstrings, API explanations, or commit message suggestions, Copilot can help make your code more readable and maintainable. Let’s break it down!\n\nProTip\n\nLet Copilot generate docstrings, explain code, and improve readability—so you can focus on coding, not commenting!\n\n1) Instant Docs with /doc (Fastest Method using Slash commands)\n\nWhat it does:\n\nQuickly generates documentation for a single method or entire file using GitHub Copilot’s /doc feature.\n\n✅ How to use it:\n\n• Right-click on a method or class\n\n• Select Copilot → Generate Docs\n\n• Review the output\n\nBest for: Quick, no-fuss documentation. May need edits for accuracy.\n\n2) Simple Prompt for XML Docs\n\nWhat it does:\n\nGenerates XML-style documentation, including function purpose, parameters, and return values.\n\n✅ Try this in Copilot Chat:\n\n\"Document this function, including its purpose, parameters, and return value.\"\n\nBest for: When you need structured XML docs without extra details.\n\n3) Role-Based Prompt for API Documentation\n\nWhat it does:\n\nCreates detailed API documentation with request parameters, response formats, and inline comments for better clarity.\n\n✅ Try this prompt:\n\n\"You are a technical writer. Write detailed documentation for this API endpoint, explaining its request parameters, response format, and usage examples. Also, add inline comments explaining each step.\"\n\nBest for: Creating well-documented API methods with explanations for developers.\n\n4) Step-by-Step Breakdown (Chain-of-Thought)\n\nWhat it does:\n\nExplains a function step-by-step and adds inline comments to improve readability.\n\n✅ Try this prompt:\n\n\"Explain the logic of this function step-by-step, then add inline comments for clarity.\"\n\nBest for: When you need clear explanations for complex logic.\n\n5) Meta Prompting for Smarter Documentation\n\nWhat it does:\n\nUses a structured prompt to guide Copilot in generating more detailed and useful documentation.\n\n✅ Try this prompt:\n\n\"Generate a detailed docstring for this function, including parameters, return values, and a short usage example.\"\n\nBest for: When you need well-structured, professional documentation that provides clear guidance for future use.\n\nGreat documentation makes great code even better! Whether it’s docstrings, inline comments, commit messages, or API explanations, GitHub Copilot can help streamline the process.",
