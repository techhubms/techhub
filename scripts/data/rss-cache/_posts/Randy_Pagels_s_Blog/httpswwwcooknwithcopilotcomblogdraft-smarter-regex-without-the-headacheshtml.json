Let Copilot generate working examples, then ask it to explain what’s going on so you can trust the result.\n\nTry These Approaches\n\n**1️⃣ Generate a Regex From Scratch**\n\n`# Write a regex that validates an email address with a domain ending in .com, .net, or .org`\n\nCopilot produces the pattern, saving you from trial and error.\n\n**2️⃣ Simplify a Complex Pattern**\n\n`# Rewrite this regex to be more readable, and explain each part`\n\nCopilot breaks it down with inline comments so you know exactly what each token does.\n\n**3️⃣ Add Test Cases Automatically**\n\n`# Generate sample strings that match and do not match this regex`\n\nGreat for validating correctness quickly without hand crafting inputs.\n\n**4️⃣ Agent Mode for Broader Coverage**\n\n`Review all regex patterns in this repo and suggest improvements for readability and maintainability`\n\nUseful for large projects where consistency matters.\n\nExtra Prompts to Try\n\n- `# Create a regex that only matches U.S. phone numbers`\n- `# Simplify this pattern for matching dates in YYYY-MM-DD format`\n- `# Suggest a regex for extracting hashtags from text`\n\nQuick Takeaway\n\nRegex doesn’t have to slow you down. With Copilot Chat, Edit, or Agent Mode, you can generate, refine, and explain patterns in minutes, not hours.",
