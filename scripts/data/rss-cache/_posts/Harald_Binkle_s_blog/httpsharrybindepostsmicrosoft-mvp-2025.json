I’m humbled and grateful for this recognition and for the people who made this journey meaningful.\n\n![Microsoft MVP crystal award with 2025 year disc](/assets/microsoft-mvp-2025.webp)\n\nThis recognition reinforces my commitment to keep sharing what I learn—openly, honestly and with practical real‑world code. It gives me fresh energy to continue speaking, running workshops and writing. It’s a powerful reminder that communities grow strongest when we teach, listen and build together.\n\nI’m deeply grateful to my family for their unfailing support behind the scenes. Your encouragement made this possible. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to [Nico Orschel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-orschel/) for being a trusted mentor and for the nomination—your support has been instrumental in this journey. Also, a big thank you to [Thomas Tomow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-tomow-963850111/) for supporting this throughout my time at Xebia; your guidance has helped shape my path in ways I deeply appreciate.\n\nThanks for being part of this journey. Let’s keep building and learning together. Let’s keep doing epic shit together!\n\n![Microsoft MVP logo](/assets/mvp-logo.webp)\n\n- [mvpbuzz](/tags/mvpbuzz)\n- [microsoftmvp](/tags/microsoftmvp)\n- [devops](/tags/devops)\n- [xebia](/tags/xebia)\n- [gratitude](/tags/gratitude)\n- [techcommunity](/tags/techcommunity)\n- [microsoft](/tags/microsoft)\n- [thankyou](/tags/thankyou)\n\nThis site uses cookies for analytics (Microsoft Clarity).
