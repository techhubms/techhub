Usually a typical office worker can get around more than 50 emails per day, with a significant portion requiring action. Manually going through messages, flagging them, or creating tasks can consume valuable time and mental energy.\n\nTraditional methods of task management often involve copy pasting emails content into a to do list app or writing notes for later checking.
