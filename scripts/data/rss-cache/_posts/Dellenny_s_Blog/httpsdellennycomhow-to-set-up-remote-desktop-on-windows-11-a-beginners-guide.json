A Beginner’s Guide\n\n- by [John Edward](https://dellenny.com/author/delenyprogmail-com/)\n- December 8, 2025December 8, 2025\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/win11remotedesktop.jpg?fit=300%2C127&amp;ssl=1)\n\nIn remote work mode having the ability to access your PC from anywhere is very useful and important to have. Whether you need to reach important files, manage apps or troubleshoot a device **Remote Desktop** on **Windows 11** gives you full access to your computer as if you were just sitting in front of it.\n\nAnd by the way setting it up is easier than you think.\n\nIn this blog, we will go through **what Remote Desktop is**, how to enable it in Windows 11, how to connect from another device, and how to solve common issues that may arise during setup.\n\n### What is Remote Desktop on Windows 11?\n\n**Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** is a Microsoft feature that gives you capability to connect from one computer to another over a network or the internet.\n\nWhen connected you can do the following:\n\n- Control the remote PC’s desktop\n- Open files and applications\n- Manage system settings\n- Perform technical support tasks\n\nIt is widely used by IT professionals, work from home employees, students, and people who travel frequently but need access to their home PCs.\n\n**Note:** Remote Desktop connection is available on those editions **Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions**. The Windows 11 **Home edition can only act as a client**, not a host. If you are using Home edition, you can still connect to other PCs but others cannot remote into yours.\n\n### Requirements to Use Remote Desktop\n\nBefore we begin setup, make sure you have:\n\n| Requirement | Why It’s Needed | | --- | --- | | Windows 11 Pro/Enterprise | To host Remote Desktop sessions | | A Microsoft account or local admin account | For login authorization | | Stable network connection | Smooth remote access | | PC must stay powered on | Otherwise connection fails | | Firewall allowing RDP | To prevent blocked connections |\n\n### How to Enable Remote Desktop on Windows 11\n\nFollow these steps to turn on Remote Desktop:\n\n#### **Step 1: Open Settings**\n\n- Click the **Start Menu**\n- Select **Settings**\n- Go to **System**\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-8.png?fit=511%2C266&amp;ssl=1)\n#### **Step 2: Select Remote Desktop**\n\n- Scroll down and click **Remote Desktop**\n\n#### **Step 3: Turn On Remote Desktop**\n\n- Toggle the switch to **On**\n- Confirm when a security prompt appears\n\nWindows will automatically adjust firewall rules to allow remote access.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-9.png?fit=475%2C32&amp;ssl=1)\n### Allow Specific Users Access (Optional)\n\nBy default, your administrator account gets access to Remote Desktop. But you can add more users.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n1. On the Remote Desktop settings page → click **“Select users that can remotely access this PC”**\n2. Click **Add**\n3. Enter the user’s name and press **OK**\n\nThis is useful if multiple people need access.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-10.png?fit=314%2C106&amp;ssl=1)\n### Check and Note Your PC Name\n\nTo connect from another device, you’ll need the **PC name**:\n\n1. Go to **Settings > System > About**\n2. Look for the **Device Name**\n\nWrite it down — you’ll use it later!\n\nIf you plan to connect **over the internet**, you may use:\n\n- **Public IP address**\n- **Dynamic DNS** (if the IP changes regularly)\n\n### Ensure Remote Desktop is Allowed Through Firewall\n\nNormally this happens automatically, but if not:\n\n1. Open **Windows Security**\n2. Go to **Firewall & network protection**\n3. Click **Allow an app through firewall**\n4. Ensure **Remote Desktop** is checked for both **Private** and **Public** networks\n\n### How to Connect to Your Windows 11 PC Remotely\n\nNow that Remote Desktop is enabled, here’s how you connect:\n\n#### Using Another Windows PC\n\n1. Open the **Remote Desktop Connection** app\n(Search **mstsc** in Start menu)\n2. Enter the **PC name** or **IP address**\n3. Click **Connect**\n4. Sign in with your Windows account credentials\n\nYou will now have full access to the remote PC.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-11.png?fit=201%2C118&amp;ssl=1)\n#### Using Mobile Devices (Android / iPhone / iPad)\n\n1. Install the **Microsoft Remote Desktop** app from the app store\n2. Tap **Add PC**\n3. Type your **PC name/IP** + account login\n4. Save and tap to connect\n\nThis gives you remote access on the go!\n\n### Accessing Your PC Over the Internet\n\nIf you want to connect from a different network (not the same Wi-Fi):\n\n- Enable **port forwarding** on your router\n→ Open port **3389** for Remote Desktop\n- Use your public IP address to connect\n\n**Security Tip:** Exposing RDP over the internet can attract hacking attempts. It’s safer to use a **VPN** to connect securely.\n\n### Common Remote Desktop Issues & Fixes\n\n| Problem | Fix | | --- | --- | | Unable to connect | Verify Remote Desktop is enabled | | Wrong credentials | Ensure correct username & password | | Firewall blocking connection | Manually allow RDP through firewall | | PC offline or asleep | Change power settings to prevent sleep | | Using Windows 11 Home as host | Upgrade to Pro | | Internet access required | Confirm both PCs are online |\n\nIf remote access is slow, check your network speed or reduce display resolution in Remote Desktop settings.\n\n### Security Tips for Remote Desktop\n\nBecause Remote Desktop provides full access to your system, always follow best practices:\n\n- Use a **strong password**\n- Enable **Network Level Authentication (NLA)**\n- Avoid public Wi-Fi, or use **VPN encryption**\n- Keep Windows security updates turned on\n\nSafe remote access ensures your data stays protected.\n\nSetting up **Remote Desktop on Windows 11** is a powerful way to take control of your PC from anywhere. Whether you’re helping a family member with troubleshooting, accessing work files from home, or traveling abroad, Remote Desktop keeps you connected.\n\nWith just a few simple configuration steps — enabling Remote Desktop, adjusting firewall settings, and knowing your PC name — you can start using remote access confidently.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-remote-desktop-on-windows-11-a-beginners-guide/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-remote-desktop-on-windows-11-a-beginners-guide/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-remote-desktop-on-windows-11-a-beginners-guide/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-remote-desktop-on-windows-11-a-beginners-guide/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-remote-desktop-on-windows-11-a-beginners-guide/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[Windows 11](https://dellenny.com/tag/windows-11/ \"Windows 11\")\n\n[previousFixing Wi-Fi Connection Problems Easily on Windows 11](https://dellenny.com/fixing-wi-fi-connection-problems-easily-on-windows-11/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
