Microsoft 365 provides a full suite of tools designed to help customers stay secure, productive, and compliant with all evolving regulatory needs. One of these essential tools is **Compliance Manager Secure Score**.\n\nIn this blog we will go through Compliance Manager Secure Score is, how it works and importance of it.\n\n## **Understanding Compliance in the Modern Workplace**\n\nCompliance involves sticking to legal regulations, industry standards, and internal policies that governs how data is stored, accessed, used, and protected. There are laws like **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, **ISO 27001**, **SOC**, and others strict requirements on organizations handling sensitive data.\n\nMicrosoft 365 serves millions of users across regulated industries making compliance to be a central priority. Microsoft offers **Compliance Manager** a powerful dashboard within the Microsoft 365 compliance center that helps organizations assess, track, and improve their compliance portfolio.\n\nOne of the core components of Compliance Manager is the **Compliance Manager Secure Score**.\n\n## **What Is the Compliance Manager Secure Score?**\n\nThe **Compliance Manager Secure Score** is a metric within Microsoft 365 Compliance Manager that measure your organization’s compliance as It helps you understand how well your organization aligns with regulatory requirements, data protection standards, and Microsoft’s recommended best practices.\n\nSo it is like a credit score but for compliance.\n\nIt provides a numerical score based on the actions you have taken or need to take to meet specific compliance standards across different assessments. The Secure Score helps you answer questions such as:\n\n- How compliant are we right now?\n- What actions should we prioritize to reduce risk?\n- How do we compare against industry benchmarks?\n- What improvements will have the biggest impact?\n\nMicrosoft designed the Secure Score to bring transparency, guidance, and accountability to the compliance process.\n\n## **How the Compliance Manager Secure Score Works**\n\nThe Secure Score is calculated based on a combination of three key components:\n\n### **1. Assessments**\n\nCompliance Manager includes assessments for a wide range of standards. Each assessment contains specific controls and recommended actions to meet those controls. Examples include:\n\n- GDPR assessment\n- NIST 800-53\n- HIPAA\n- ISO 27001\n- Microsoft Data Protection Baseline\n\nAssessments are mapped to the regulatory or internal requirements your organization needs to meet. Each assessment contributes points to your overall Secure Score.\n\n### **2. Compliance Controls**\n\nControls are the individual requirements within each assessment. For example, a GDPR assessment may include controls related to:\n\n- Data encryption\n- Access restrictions\n- Logging and monitoring\n- Consent tracking\n- Data minimization\n\nEach control includes detailed implementation steps and guidance. Completing these controls raises your Secure Score.\n\nControls are also weighted, meaning some have a larger impact on the score than others depending on their importance.\n\n### **3. Improvement Actions**\n\nImprovement actions are the practical steps Microsoft recommends to help you meet compliance requirements. Examples include:\n\n- Enabling multi-factor authentication\n- Configuring data loss prevention (DLP)\n- Setting up retention policies\n- Reviewing access permissions\n- Enabling audit logging\n\nEach improvement action comes with:\n\n- A description of why it matters\n- Step-by-step instructions\n- Testing guidance\n- Control mapping (showing which regulation it helps satisfy)\n- Points awarded upon completion\n\nBy completing improvement actions, organizations not only boost their Secure Score but also strengthen their compliance and security posture.\n\n## **Why the Compliance Manager Secure Score Matters**\n\n### **1. Helps Prioritize Compliance Efforts**\n\nRegulatory for compliance can be overwhelming. Hundreds of controls and requirements are difficult to manage without a organized structured approach. Secure Score simplifies this by highlighting the most impactful actions and guiding you through steps.\n\n### **2. Supports Risk Reduction**\n\nMany compliance failures happen because organizations overlook essential actions. The Secure Score helps prevent these gaps by bringing visibility to risk areas and offering actionable remediation.\n\n### **3. Aligns Compliance and Security**\n\nCompliance and security often overlap, but they are not identical. Secure Score bridges the gap by emphasizing controls that improve both areas such as encryption, access control, and auditing.\n\n### **4. Provides Evidence for Audits**\n\nAuditors want proof of compliance . Secure Score automatically documents completed actions, making it easier to prove your organization has implemented necessary controls.\n\n### **5. Offers Continuous Monitoring**\n\nCompliance is not one time task. Secure Score helps you track your progress over time and alerts you when certain controls need reevaluation or updates.\n\n### **6. Enhances Communication with Executives**\n\nExecutives often want a clear picture of compliance status The numerical score provides an easy representation of organizational compliance.\n\n## **Compliance Manager Secure Score vs. Microsoft Secure Score**\n\nMany organizations mistakenly assume these are the same, but they serve different purposes:\n\n| Feature | Compliance Manager Secure Score | Microsoft Secure Score | | --- | --- | --- | | Focus | Compliance posture | Security posture | | Scope | Regulatory and industry standards (GDPR, ISO, HIPAA) | Security settings and user actions | | Location | Microsoft 365 Compliance Center | Microsoft 365 Security Center | | Purpose | Improve compliance readiness | Strengthen security defenses |\n\nBoth are valuable—but they address different needs.\n\n## **How to Access the Compliance Manager Secure Score**\n\nYou can access Secure Score through:\n\n- **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.png?fit=1024%2C728&amp;ssl=1)\n- **Microsoft** **Purview**→ *Compliance Manager*\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-1.png?fit=1024%2C363&amp;ssl=1)\n- Navigate to **Assessments** or **Improvement Actions**\n- Your Secure Score appears as part of the dashboard\n\nOrganizations with Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft 365 E5 Compliance gain the most comprehensive access to Compliance Manager features.\n\n## **Best Practices for Maximizing Your Secure Score**\n\nIf you want to improve your Compliance Manager Secure Score, consider the following strategies:\n\n### **1. Start with Mandatory Assessments**\n\nFocus on regulations that directly apply to your organization (e.g., GDPR for EU customers, HIPAA for healthcare).\n\n### **2. Complete High-Impact Improvement Actions First**\n\nSome actions contribute more points. Prioritize these for quicker progress.\n\n### **3. Assign Responsibilities**\n\nDelegate improvement actions to decision-makers or IT staff with proper access and expertise.\n\n### **4. Use Automation Where Possible**\n\nAutomated policies—such as retention rules and DLP policies—reduce manual effort and ensure ongoing compliance.\n\n### **5. Regularly Review Your Score**\n\nCompliance requirements evolve, and your score may change. Make regular reviews part of your compliance process.\n\n### **6.
