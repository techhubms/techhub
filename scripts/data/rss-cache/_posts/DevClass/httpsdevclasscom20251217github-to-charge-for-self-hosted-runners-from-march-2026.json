The move comes as competitors offer faster, cheaper alternatives.\n\nWhile GitHub-hosted runner prices will drop [20 and 39 percent from January 1 2026](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/), the new self-hosted fees have drawn sharp criticism. Developers object to paying per-minute charges for software running on their own infrastructure.\n\nGitHub [justifies the change](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/) by noting that GitHub-hosted revenue was subsidizing free self-hosted runners, despite costs for “maintaining and evolving GitHub Actions” (which now runs 71 million jobs daily).\n\nThe price changes do not affect users of GitHub Enterprise Server, which runs on-premises, and GitHub Actions remain free for public repositories. The company claims that “96 percent of customers will see no change to their bill”, and that most customers who are impacted will pay less.\n\nDevelopers in discussions, such as [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1po996g/starting_march_1_2026_github_will_introduce_a_new/) on Reddit, complain about “the audacity to charge for self-hosted compute.” Paying to run licensed software is hardly new, however, the change is unpalatable for some.\n\nGitHub’s move may be in response to competitors such as Depot, which offers optimized runners for GitHub actions, with per-second billing, at what [it claims](https://depot.dev) is “half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners.”\n\nOne user [branded](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46291975) the change as “absolutely bananas”, saying: “for my own CI workflow I’ll have to pay $140+/month now just to run my own hardware” – though this reflects unusually intensive usage.\n\nWhy is developer reaction negative overall? Despite there being a cost reduction for many users, GitHub is perceived as neglecting its core platform. A developer observed that the open source runner application, used to set up a self-hosted machine, is not taking contributions, the [stated reason](https://github.com/actions/runner?tab=readme-ov-file#note) being that “we are allocating resources towards other areas of Actions.” One customer [complained](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46294001) that GitHub runners are hard to host, with an “unnecessarily byzantine” configuration process, and there are faults with the service including inability to cancel jobs cleanly and consistency problems.\n\nSelf-hosted runners are popular in part because of performance issues with the GitHub-hosted option. “We self host the runners in our infrastructure and the builds are over 10x faster than relying on their cloud runners,” [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46292716) one user.\n\nGitHub said that along with the price changes it will invest in self-hosted Actions, with a new scale-set client, [multi-label support](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1195) for Actions Runner Controller for more flexibility in managing runners, and a new Actions Data Stream which will provide real-time observability data for GitHub workflows.\n\nWhile this may help, the company has a lot to do in order to persuade developers that it is focused on core platform improvements, rather than just controversial AI features and user interface changes. The Zig project recently moved away from GitHub [citing](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/zig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly/) unreliable and neglected Actions as one of the reasons.\n\n[## Cursor AI editor gets visual designer – but bugs and ever-changing UI irk developers](https://devclass.com/2025/12/16/cursor-ai-editor-gets-visual-designer-but-bugs-and-ever-changing-ui-irk-developers/)[## Rust boosted by permanent adoption for Linux kernel code](https://devclass.com/2025/12/15/rust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code/)[## VS Code update brings agent overload, TypeScript 7 preview, and the end of IntelliCode](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/vs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode/)[## Research: AI can help or hinder software development, and old-style best practices make the differen...](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/research-ai-can-help-or-hinder-software-development-and-old-style-best-practices-make-the-difference/)[## JetBrains abandons Fleet IDE, pins hopes on forthcoming Air agentic development tool](https://devclass.com/2025/12/09/jetbrains-abandons-fleet-ide-pins-hopes-on-forthcoming-air-agentic-development-tool/)[## AWS shows Rust love at re:Invent: 10 times faster than Kotlin, one tenth the latency of Go](https://devclass.com/2025/12/08/aws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go/)[## Akamai buys Fermyon for Wasm-based serverless functions – a possible answer to Cloudflare workers](https://devclass.com/2025/12/04/akamai-acquires-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers/)[## Bun JavaScript runtime acquired by Anthropic, tying its future to AI coding](https://devclass.com/2025/12/03/bun-javascript-runtime-acquired-by-anthropic-tying-its-future-to-ai-coding/)[## Zig project ditches GitHub for Codeberg but move could be costly](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/zig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly/)[## Microsoft Visual Studio shifts to annual releases, raising cost concerns](https://devclass.com/2025/11/25/microsoft-visual-studio-shifts-to-annual-releases-raising-cost-concerns/)[## Google's Chromium team decides it will add JPEG XL support, reverses 'obsolete' declaration](https://devclass.com/2025/11/24/googles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration/)[## Copilot .Net modernization tool a 'huge downgrade,' devs say – and no longer free](https://devclass.com/2025/11/20/copilot-net-modernization-tool-a-huge-downgrade-devs-say-and-no-longer-free/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
