The images have an Apache 2.0 license and Docker promises “no licensing surprises.”\n\nAn enterprise license is required for additional features including compliance with FIPS (federal information processing standards) and DoD STIG (department of defense secure technical implementation guide), available for some but not all hardened images, customization, and 7-day critical CVE remediation.\n\nHardened images are pulled from Docker Hub, but the catalog of definitions is [on GitHub](https://github.com/docker-hardened-images/catalog), where users can also request new images. Since the announcement yesterday, a number of new hardened images have already been requested.\n\nDHI were introduced as a [commercial offering in May 2025](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-hardened-images/). Images are built on Alpine or Debian Linux, and typically have no shell, no package manager, and run as a non-root user. The minimalist approach means that migration from non-hardened images requires some changes to the workflow. The hardened image for PHP, for example, comes with a minimal set of packages. Adding further packages can be done using a -dev version of the image to install the packages, and then copying the resulting artifacts to the runtime variant.\n\nHardened images do not restrict what you add to them, though the modifications may reduce their security. “That’s where scanners like Docker Scout, Trivy, Grype, and more come in to review the complete image that you have built,” [explained](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305140) a Docker employee on Hacker News.\n\nAnother issue is debugging. Since there is no shell, developers may need a tool such as Docker Debug, which provides a shell and tools such as editors and process viewers without modifying the hardened image. Docker Debug requires Docker Desktop, which requires a subscription in most business cases.\n\nThe benefit though is substantial, with the hardened images being both smaller and more secure than the general-purpose equivalents. Docker claims up to a 95 percent reduction in attack surface.\n\nInitial reaction is positive, though some are wary of the future, based on Docker’s history of reducing its free offerings and pushing subscriptions. “It’s free for now, just like registries were ‘free’ and docker desktop was free… until they weren’t,” said [one](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305222).\n\nEarlier this year, Bitnami (part of VMWare) withdrew its free public catalog of images, which were free prior to Broadcom’s acquisition of VMWare, suggesting that users shift to a subscription to Bitnami Secure Images at $50,000 or more annually. Bitnami [said](https://community.broadcom.com/tanzu/blogs/beltran-rueda-borrego/2025/08/18/how-to-prepare-for-the-bitnami-changes-coming-soon) in its defense that “Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive.”\n\nA comment from Docker [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305233) that DHI are sustainable because “we do offer an enterprise tier for companies that need things like contractual continuous patching SLAs, regulated-industry variants (FIPS, etc.), and secure customizations with full provenance and attestations. Those things carry very real ongoing costs, so keeping them in Enterprise allows us to make the entire hardened catalog free for the community.”\n\nIt may be hard though to use DHI in a business without some level of Docker subscription, since a login is required, alongside needing Docker Desktop for some tools.\n\n[## Akamai buys Fermyon for Wasm-based serverless functions – a possible answer to Cloudflare workers](https://devclass.com/2025/12/04/akamai-acquires-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers/)[## Docker adds AI agents to Compose along with GPU-powered cloud Offload service](https://devclass.com/2025/07/10/docker-adds-ai-agents-to-compose-along-with-gpu-powered-cloud-offload-service/)[## Security researcher exploits GitHub gotcha, gets admin access to all Istio repositories and more](https://devclass.com/2025/07/03/security-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more/)[## Cloudflare container platform in public preview with scale to zero pricing, some initial limitations](https://devclass.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-container-platform-in-public-preview-with-scale-to-zero-pricing-some-initial-limitations/)[## \"Serious\" MySQL bug celebrates 20 years unfixed - another reason to switch to PostgreSQL?](https://devclass.com/2025/06/24/serious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql/)[## Misconfigured GitHub Actions could leave repos and secrets exposed, Sysdig finds](https://devclass.com/2025/06/18/misconfigured-github-actions-could-leave-repos-and-secrets-exposed-sysdig-finds/)[## Redefining identity security in the age of agentic AI](https://devclass.com/2025/06/17/redefining-identity-security-in-the-age-of-agentic-ai/)[## Apple's Containerization will matter to developers – but Podman devs complain of unfixed issues](https://devclass.com/2025/06/11/apples-containerization-will-matter-to-developers-but-podman-devs-complain-of-unfixed-issues/)[## Cursor AI editor hits 1.0 milestone, including BugBot and high-risk background agents](https://devclass.com/2025/06/06/cursor-ai-editor-hits-1-0-milestone-including-bugbot-and-high-risk-background-agents/)[## Researchers warn of prompt injection vulnerability in GitHub MCP with no obvious fix](https://devclass.com/2025/05/27/researchers-warn-of-prompt-injection-vulnerability-in-github-mcp-with-no-obvious-fix/)[## MCP will be built into Windows to make an 'agentic OS' but security will be a key concern](https://devclass.com/2025/05/19/mcp-will-be-built-into-windows-to-make-an-agentic-os-but-security-will-be-a-key-concern/)[## Docker introduces MCP Catalog and Toolkit as vendors scramble to support the protocol despite securi...](https://devclass.com/2025/04/22/docker-introduces-mcp-catalog-and-toolkit-as-vendors-scramble-to-support-the-protocol-despite-security-concerns/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)"
