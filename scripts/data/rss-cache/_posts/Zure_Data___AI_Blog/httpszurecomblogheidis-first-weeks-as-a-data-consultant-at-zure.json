For **Heidi Hämäläinen**, a Data Consultant with a focus on Data and AI Governance, this philosophy has guided her throughout her career. But what brought her specifically to Zure, and why does she believe it’s an exceptional place for like-minded professionals?\n\n![thumbnail IMG 8237](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/thumbnail_IMG_8237-768x1024.jpg)Heidi’s first day as a Zurean\n\nWhen Heidi first heard about Zure hiring data professionals, her curiosity was piqued because Zure was open to hiring someone with a non-technical data background. “I was surprised,” Heidi reflects, “but it immediately appealed to me because I’ve always bridged the gap between data strategy and technical implementation.”\n\nHer previous experiences had shown her that many companies keep data and technology in separate silos, which limits their potential. At Zure, she found a culture eager to break down these walls, an environment committed to genuine collaboration. “When I first encountered Zure at a data seminar some time ago, their unity and community-oriented spirit stood out,” Heidi recalls. “It felt authentic, real and deeply aligned with their values.”\n\n![IMG 8408 1](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8408-1-768x1024.jpeg) ![IMG 8424 1](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8424-1-768x1024.jpeg) ![IMG 8444](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8444-768x1024.jpeg) ![IMG 8425](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8425-768x1024.jpeg) ![IMG 8440](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8440-1024x768.jpeg) ![IMG 8455](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_8455-768x1024.jpeg) Heidi appreciates Zure’s centrally located office in downtown Helsinki. These snapshots capture the vibrant atmosphere of her summer commutes, which she enjoys partly on foot.\n\n## Embracing authentic collaboration\n\nFrom her very first days at Zure, Heidi found herself not only warmly welcomed but actively engaged with clients and experts across the company. “The onboarding was seamless and human-focused,” she shares. “I immediately felt like part of the community. Everyone genuinely cares, and this level of authenticity translates directly into how we serve our clients.”\n\nZure’s ethos of embracing failure as part of learning deeply resonates with Heidi. “We speak openly about our mistakes here,” she says. “Failure is genuinely seen as an opportunity for growth. It’s part of our DNA.”\n\nHer team, diverse and deeply knowledgeable, is another cornerstone of her positive experience. “Everyone brings profound expertise to the table, and that empowers me to build effective frameworks that leverage each individual’s strengths,” Heidi explains. “I’m continuously learning, not just from structured training, but from everyday interactions with colleagues who are more than willing to share their insights.”\n\n## A culture of growth and work-life balance\n\nWhat sets Zure apart in Heidi’s eyes isn’t merely technical capability, it’s the community-driven, people-centric culture deeply embedded in its values. “Living what you preach, that’s what Zure does genuinely,” Heidi emphasizes. “Here, work-life balance is not just an empty promise. We work smart, within our hours, and prioritize personal well-being. It’s a healthy balance that enables us to deliver our best work.”\n\nFor data professionals considering a move, Heidi’s advice is clear: “If you’re someone who values authentic community, enjoys tackling complex problems head-on, and believes that effective AI solutions begin with solid data governance, then Zure is your place.”\n\nAt Zure, Heidi found not only a place to apply her expertise but also a home for her professional growth and personal authenticity. It’s more than a job, it’s a place where challenges are met with a roar, collaboration thrives, and every individual contributes uniquely to the bigger picture.\n\n##### Share this post:\n\n![Marika Pitkänen](https://zure.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mp1.jpg)\n\n##### Marika Pitkänen\n\n**Marketing Specialist**\n\nMarika is a skilled marketer with a versatile experience in strategic content marketing and employer branding.
