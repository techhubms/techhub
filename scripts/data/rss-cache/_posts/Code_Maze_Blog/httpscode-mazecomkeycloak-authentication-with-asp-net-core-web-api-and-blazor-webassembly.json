If you don’t have it installed, just use the provided link and install it, it is simply as that.\n\nWe can open the docker desktop app and then run this command in the CMD or PowerShell window:\n\n`docker run -p 8080:8080 -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin -e KC_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.1.1 start-dev`\n\n**This will download the image and install the required container mapping the port 8080, and providing the username and admin parameters.**\n\nWith the image downloaded, we can see that the container is already running, and let’s navigate to `localhost:8080/admin` to be redirected to the login popup.\n\nLet’s use credentials: admin, admin.\n\n## Preparing Keycloak Authentication With a Realm, Clients, and Users\n\nSo, the first thing we are going to do is to create a new realm. A realm in Keycloak is an isolated authentication and authorization space where users, roles, clients, and identity providers are managed. It acts as a container for everything related to identity and access management.\n\nIs this material useful to you? Consider subscribing and get **ASP.NET Core Web API Best Practices** eBook for [FREE!](https://code-maze.com/free-ebook-aspnetcore-webapi-best-practices/)\n\nBy default, a master realm is created, but we need a new one:\n\n[![Creating New Realm for Keycloak Authentication](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Creating-New-Realm-for-Keycloak-Authentication.png)](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Creating-New-Realm-for-Keycloak-Authentication.png)\n\nSo, we need to:\n\n- Click on the master realm and once the menu appears click on the `Create realm`\nbutton\n- Add a name for our realm – BlazorWebApiRealm\n- Click the `Create`\nbutton\n\nWith this, we create a new realm and navigate directly there.\n\n## Create Web API Client For Keycloak Authentication\n\nSo, we need to register both clients (Web API and Blazor WASM), and let’s start with the Web API client.\n\nTo do that, let’s open the Clients menu and click the Create client button:\n\n[![Create client for Keycloack Authentication](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Create-client-for-Keycloack-Authentication.png)](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Create-client-for-Keycloack-Authentication.png)\n\nOnce the “Create client” page opens, we can populate the required fields:\n\nIs this material useful to you? Consider subscribing and get **ASP.NET Core Web API Best Practices** eBook for [FREE!](https://code-maze.com/free-ebook-aspnetcore-webapi-best-practices/)\n\n- The Client type is OpenID Connect which is set by default\n- Client ID: web-api (you can add the Name and Description if you want)\n- Client Authentication: Off\n- Authorization: Off\n- Standard Flow Enabled: Off\n- Direct Access Grants Enabled: Off\n- Both Root and Home URLs are blank\n- Click Save.\n\nSince the Web API client is our server app, we don’t need to populate anything except the Client ID field.\n\n## Mapping to Correct Audience\n\nWe need to map a correct Audience for the Web API client because without this step the `aud` claim will be just an “account”, which we don’t want.\n\nTo do that, let’s open the `Client scopes` menu and hit the `Create client scope` button:\n\n[![Create client scope for Keycloack authentication](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Create-client-scope-for-Keycloack-authentication.png)](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Create-client-scope-for-Keycloack-authentication.png)\n\nOnce the page opens\n\n- Then, we need to populate the Name: `blazor_api_scope`\n, and add some description\n- Also, let’s turn on `Include in token scope`\nso that the scope is included in the generated access token (if you need it)\n- Finally, let’s click the `Save`\nbutton\n\nAfter we are done with the scope creation, we will see a new page with the `Mappers` tab. We need to open that tab and:\n\n- Click the `Configure new mapper`\nbutton\n- Chose `Audience`\nfrom the table – this will be a `Mapper type`\n- Add any meaningful name like `blazor_api audience`\n- Select the `web-api`\nclient in the `Included Client Audience` DDL\n- Click the `Save`\nbutton\n\nThis ensures any time the blazor\\_api\\_scope is requested and granted, the blazor\\_api\\_audience will be added to the access token.\n\n## Create Blazor Client For Keycloak Authentication\n\nSo, as we did with the previous client, we have to navigate to the `Clients` menu and hit the `Create client` button.\n\nIs this material useful to you? Consider subscribing and get **ASP.NET Core Web API Best Practices** eBook for [FREE!](https://code-maze.com/free-ebook-aspnetcore-webapi-best-practices/)\n\nNow, we can populate the required fields\n\n- Client type is by default OpenID Connect\n- Client ID: blazor-client (you can provide a name and a description if you want)\n- Client Type: Public – client authentication is set to off because Blazor WASM apps are considered public clients\n- We should select the Standard flow only\n- Valid Redirect URIs: `https://localhost:5000/authentication/login-callback`\n- Logout Redirect: `https://localhost:5000/authentication/logout-callback`\n- Click the `Save`\nbutton to save changes\n\nOnce we save changes, we can see the Web origins populated automatically for CORS. **Also, pay attention that our app is running on localhost:5000 – if yours is running on a different port, you should provide that one.**\n\nAdditionally, we need to allow our front-end app to request the client scope we created earlier. That’s how it can get access tokens with the correct audience.\n\nSo, from the current screen:\n\n- Open the `Client scopes`\ntab and click the `Add client scope` button\n- Select the previously created scope `blazor_api_scope`\n- Add-Optional as we want the client to request it and not add it by default\n\nGreat.\n\nWe should be able to locate `blazor_api_scope` in the scope list right after the `address` and `basic` scopes.\n\n## Create a User\n\nTo create a new user in Keycloak, let’s navigate to the `Users` menu and hit a `Create new user` button:\n\n[![Create a new User in Keycloak](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Create-a-new-User-in-Keycloak.png)](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Create-a-new-User-in-Keycloak.png)\n\nOnce on the form, let’s populate the necessary fields:\n\n- Username: codemaze\n- Email: [\\[email protected\\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)\n- First name: Code\n- Last name: Maze\n- Click the `Create`\nbutton to create a new user\n\nThis user needs a password to log in. So, to set the initial password:\n\n- Click `Credentials`\nat the top of the page\n- Click the `Set password`\nbutton and populate the form with a password\n- Toggle Temporary to Off so the user does not need to update this password at the first login\n- Hit the `Save`\nbutton\n\nExcellent.\n\nWith all the previous steps, we have prepared a Keycloak authentication with the Keycloak’s dashboard, and now we can do some coding.\n\n## Configure Web API For the Keycloak Authentication\n\nInside the Web API project, we first need to install the package: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`\n\nIt will help us with the authentication process.\n\nThen, in the `Program.cs` class, let’s add the required code for the authentication:\n\n``` using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer; using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;\n\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\nbuilder.Services.AddCors(policy => { policy.AddPolicy(\"CorsPolicy\", opt => opt .AllowAnyOrigin() .AllowAnyHeader() .AllowAnyMethod()); });\n\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme) .AddJwtBearer(options => { options.Authority = \"http://localhost:8080/realms/BlazorWebApiRealm\"; options.Audience = \"web-api\"; options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false; options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters { ValidateIssuer = true, ValidateAudience = true, ValidateLifetime = true, ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true }; }); builder.Services.AddAuthorization();\n\nbuilder.Services.AddControllers();\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\napp.UseHttpsRedirection(); app.UseCors(\"CorsPolicy\");\n\napp.UseAuthentication(); app.UseAuthorization();\n\napp.MapControllers();\n\napp.Run(); ```\n\nSo, with the AddAuthentication method, we register JWT Bearer Authentication as the authentication scheme. It ensures that incoming requests must include a valid JWT token.\n\nIs this material useful to you? Consider subscribing and get **ASP.NET Core Web API Best Practices** eBook for [FREE!](https://code-maze.com/free-ebook-aspnetcore-webapi-best-practices/)\n\nThen, with `options.Authority` we specify the Keycloak realm endpoint (/realms/BlazorWebApiRealm). It can be found on the `Realm Settings` menu -&gt; `OpenID Endpoint Configuration` link. It will open a new page with the authority (issuer) as the first element.\n\nWe also provide the correct audience, which is the client ID of the Web API client.\n\nAdditionally, we disable the requirement for HTTPS in local development. In production, this should be true to enforce secure communication.\n\nThen, we provide validation parameters to ensure the valid issuer, audience, token expiration, and token signature.\n\nFinally, we call the `AddAuthorization()` method to add the authorization policy services and also call the `UseAuthentication()` method to enable authentication middleware.\n\n## Blazor WASM Configuration.\n\nOk, after we are done with the server app, we can continue with the Blazor WebAssembly app and configure the Keycloak authentication there.\n\nWe must have this package: `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication` installed. Since we use the Blazor WASM app with Individual Users for Authentication, it should already be installed.\n\nNow, let’s modify the `Program.cs` class:\n\nIs this material useful to you? Consider subscribing and get **ASP.NET Core Web API Best Practices** eBook for [FREE!](https://code-maze.com/free-ebook-aspnetcore-webapi-best-practices/)\n\n``` builder.Services.AddOidcAuthentication(options => { options.ProviderOptions.Authority = \"http://localhost:8080/realms/BlazorWebApiRealm\"; options.ProviderOptions.ClientId = \"blazor-client\"; options.ProviderOptions.ResponseType = \"code\"; options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add(\"blazor_api_scope\"); }); ```\n\nHere, we modify the existing `AddOidcAuthentication()` method, and provide information about the authority (realm), client ID, the response type, and we explicitly ask for the mapped scope.\n\nThen, let’s modify the HttpClient configuration to include the access token:\n\n``` builder.Services.AddHttpClient(\"WeatherAPI\", client => client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"https://localhost:5001/\")) .AddHttpMessageHandler(sp => { var handler = sp.GetRequiredService<AuthorizationMessageHandler>() .ConfigureHandler(authorizedUrls: [\"https://localhost:5001\"]);\n\nreturn handler; });\n\nbuilder.Services.AddScoped(sp => sp.GetRequiredService<IHttpClientFactory>().CreateClient(\"WeatherAPI\")); ```\n\nFor this to work, we need to install the `Micrososft.Extensions.Http` package.\n\nHere, we configure an HTTP client to securely communicate with a protected Web API. With the `AddHttpClient()` method, we register an HTTP client named “WeatherAPI” with a base address. We also attach an `AuthorizationMessageHandler` , which ensures that authentication tokens are included when making requests to the specified authorized URLs.\n\nThen, we use the `AddScoped()` method to register a scoped service that retrieves the named HTTP client (WeatherAPI) from the `IHttpClientFactory` , allowing it to be injected into Blazor components or services. With this, the client app automatically handles authentication and authorization when making API requests.\n\nIf you want to learn more about HttpClientFactory, and how to use it with typed and named clients, you can read our [HttpClientFactory article](https://code-maze.com/using-httpclientfactory-in-asp-net-core-applications/)\n\nOk, let’s protect the Blazor’s Weather page:\n\n``` @page \"/weather\" @inject HttpClient Http @using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization @attribute [Authorize] ```\n\nThis will require an authorized user to access this page.\n\nFinally, in the `@code` section of the same page, we need to modify the Http call:\n\nIs this material useful to you? Consider subscribing and get **ASP.NET Core Web API Best Practices** eBook for [FREE!](https://code-maze.com/free-ebook-aspnetcore-webapi-best-practices/)\n\n`forecasts = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>(\"weatherforecast\");`\n\n## Test Keycloak Authentication With the Blazor Client App\n\nLet’s run both API and Blazor applications. Once that is done, we will see the Login link in the upper-right corner, so let’s click on it:\n\n[![Login button for the authentication in Blazor WASM](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Login-button-for-the-authentication-in-Blazor-WASM.png)](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Login-button-for-the-authentication-in-Blazor-WASM.png)\n\nOnce we do that, the Keycloak Authentication popup will appear where we need to use the credentials of our created user. You can also see the “Hello” message and the `Log out` button.\n\nNow, we can navigate to the Weather page, and we should get the data:\n\n[![Data retreived from authenticated API server app](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Data-retreived-from-authenticated-API-server-app-with-Keycloak.png)](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Data-retreived-from-authenticated-API-server-app-with-Keycloak.png)\n\nHowever, the API endpoint is not authorized.\n\nWe can click the `Log out` button, and we will be logged out.\n\n## Authorizing Web API and Testing Again\n\nSo, first, we need to add the `Authorize` attribute to our controller:\n\n``` [HttpGet] [Authorize] public IEnumerable<WeatherForecast> Get() ```\n\nAgain, we can run both apps, authenticate, and fetch the data. Everything should work.\n\n### Inspecting the Token\n\nTo inspect the scope and the token, we can open the dev tools -&gt; applications tab.\n\nThere, under the Session storage menu, we can find the third “oidc” key:\n\n[![Inspect access token in browser](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Token-for-Keycloak-Authentication.png)](https://code-maze.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Token-for-Keycloak-Authentication.png)\n\nWe can copy the access token (bottom-right of the screen), which we can inspect on the jwt.io site. There, we will see what are the values for the issuer and audience properties, and those should match our configuration:\n\n``` { \"exp\": 1739446851, \"iat\": 1739446551, \"auth_time\": 1739446549, \"jti\": \"c1e7e9a7-8bf0-4766-b694-7105c6894a02\", \"iss\": \"http://localhost:8080/realms/BlazorWebApiRealm\", \"aud\": [ \"web-api\", \"account\" ], ... } ```\n\nOk, now, you can read how to [use roles with Keycloak, Web API, and Blazor WASM](https://code-maze.com/keycloak-roles-blazor-webassembly-web-api/) to complete the learning circle here.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy integrating Keycloak authentication with Blazor WebAssembly and a .NET Web API, we provide a secure and scalable identity management solution. With the OpenID Connect and OAuth2 support, we ensure that only authenticated users can access protected resources. The Web API validates JWT tokens issued by Keycloak, while the Blazor WASM app handles authentication and API requests using an AuthorizationMessageHandler.\n\nIn the next article, we will learn about Role-Based Authorization between Blazor WASM and Web API apps, using Keycloak.\n\nIs this material useful to you?
