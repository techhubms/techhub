  "Description": "## Overview\n\nEnd‑to‑end testing at scale is a common challenge when teams need reliable, cross‑browser validation without managing infrastructure. **Azure Playwright Testing Service (Preview)** simplifies this by allowing you to run Playwright tests on **cloud-hosted browsers directly from your local setup**.\n\nIn this post, I’ll walk through how to:\n\n- Set up Azure Playwright Testing Service\n- Configure your Playwright project\n- Run UI and API tests on remote browsers\n- View execution logs, HTML reports, and traces\n\nThis guide uses **Playwright with TypeScript** in **Visual Studio / VS Code** and is based on hands‑on setup steps.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure you have:\n\n- An active Azure subscription\n- Node.js installed\n- A Playwright project using TypeScript\n- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code\n\n## Step 1: Create a Playwright Workspace in Azure Portal\n\n1. Go to **Azure Portal → Microsoft Playwright Testing (Preview)**\n2. Select your **subscription** and **region**\n3. Create a **new workspace**\n\nOnce created, the workspace will serve as the execution environment for your cloud browser tests.\n\n## Step 2: Create a Playwright Project Locally\n\nCreate a Playwright project in **Visual Studio** or **VS Code** and add your test cases under the tests folder.\n\nExample structure:\n\n> >\n> tests/\n> > >\n> └── example.spec.ts\n> >\n\nYour Playwright tests will be executed from this project using Azure-hosted browsers.\n\n## Step 3: Add Playwright Service Configuration\n\n1. Open your Azure Playwright workspace\n2. On the **Home** page, download the **Playwright service configuration file**\n- Link provided in portal: https://aka.ms/mpt/service-config\n3. Add the file (playwright.service.config.ts) to your project\n4. Place it **in the same directory as** playwright.config.ts\n\nThis configuration enables communication between your local tests and the cloud service.\n\n## Step 4: Generate Access Token and Service URL\n\nWithin the Playwright Testing portal:\n\n1. Generate a **new access token**\n2. Copy:\n- Access Token\n- Region-specific Service URL\n\n## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables\n\nCreate a .env file in the same folder as your config files and add:\n\n> >\n> PLAYWRIGHT\\_SERVICE\\_ACCESS\\_TOKEN={YOUR\\_ACCESS\\_TOKEN} PLAYWRIGHT\\_SERVICE\\_URL={YOUR\\_REGION\\_ENDPOINT}\n> >\n\nThese values authenticate your test runs with Azure Playwright Testing Service.\n\n## Step 6: Install Playwright VS Code Extension (Optional)\n\nFor an improved developer experience, install the **Playwright Test extension**:\n\n- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright\n\n## Step 7: Run Tests on Remote Browsers\n\nOpen a terminal and run:\n\nTo execute a **specific test file**:\n\n> >\n> npx playwright test example.spec.ts --config=playwright.service.config.ts\n> >\n\nTo execute the **entire test suite in parallel**:\n\n> >\n> npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --workers=20\n> >\n\nTo open the latest HTML report:\n\n> >\n> npx playwright show-report\n> >\n\n## Step 8: Monitor Test Execution in Azure Portal\n\nReturn to the **Playwright Testing portal** and refresh the workspace to view:\n\n- Test cases executed\n- Test suite runtime\n- Execution time across browsers\n- Activity logs for each run\n\nAn **HTML report** is automatically generated, showing:\n\n- Passed and failed test cases\n- Detailed error logs\n- Step‑by‑step execution data\n\nBoth passed and failed logs are available in the report for analysis.\n\n## Viewing Traces and Debugging Failures\n\nTo analyze detailed execution flows:\n\n- Install **Playwright Trace Viewer**\n- Open the stdout or trace file from the test run\n\nThis helps inspect:\n\n- UI actions\n- Timing\n- DOM state at each step\n\n## Running API Tests with Playwright\n\nYou can also execute **API test cases** alongside UI tests by defining request configurations and assertions within Playwright.\n\nThis enables combining UI and API validations into a **single testing pipeline**.\n\n## Playwright Testing with Visual Studio and TypeScript\n\nFor Visual Studio users:\n\n- Use the same .env and playwright.service.config.ts\n- Install dotenv:\n\n> >\n> npm install --save-dev dotenv\n> >\n\nRun the test suite:\n\n> >\n> npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --workers=20\n> >\n\nView execution details in the **Playwright portal**: [https://aka.ms/mpt/portal](https://aka.ms/mpt/portal)\n\n## What’s Next?\n\n- Explore parallel test execution to reduce runtime\n- Add trace analysis as part of CI debugging\n- Extend the setup into CI/CD workflows\n- Combine Playwright UI and API tests for end‑to‑end validation\n\nHave you tried Azure Playwright Testing Service yet?
