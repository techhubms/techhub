Today, we’re excited to take the next step on that journey with a major release of the Application Insights SDK 3.x for .NET.\n\n# Migrate to OpenTelemetry with a Major Version Bump\n\nWith Application Insights SDK **3.x**, developers can migrate to OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation with dramatically less effort. Until now, migrating from classic Application Insights SDK to the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro required a clean install and code updates.\n\nWith this release, **most customers can adopt OpenTelemetry simply by upgrading their SDK version.** The new SDK automatically routes your classic Application Insights Track\\* APIs calls through a new mapping layer that emits OpenTelemetry signals under the hood.\n\n# Why This Matters\n\nBy upgrading, you gain:\n\n**✔ Vendor‑neutral OpenTelemetry APIs going forward** You can immediately begin writing new code using OpenTelemetry APIs, ensuring future portability and alignment with industry standards.\n\n**✔ Access to the full OpenTelemetry ecosystem** You can now easily plug in community instrumentation libraries and exporters. For example, collecting Redis Cache dependency data—previously not supported with Application Insights 2.x—becomes straightforward.\n\n**✔ Multi‑exporter support** Export to Azure Monitor and another system (e.g., a SIEM or backend of your choice) simultaneously if your scenario requires it.\n\n# What Still Requires Attention: Initializers and Processors\n\nOne area where automatic migration is not possible is **telemetry processors and telemetry initializers**. These Application Insights extensibility points were extremely flexible, allowing custom property injection, filtering, or deletion logic.\n\nOpenTelemetry supports similar behavior, but through more structured concepts such as **span processors**. See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/blob/main/BreakingChanges.md) for a full list of breaking changes.\n\nOn a positive note, these OpenTelemetry components generally deliver better performance and clearer behavior. Our [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/migrate-to-opentelemetry) assists with migration, and we plan to release an MCP with guardrails to assist LLM in accurate coding.\n\n# Keeping the essence of Azure Monitor Application Insights\n\nWhile OpenTelemetry encourages the use of the OpenTelemetry-Collector, we remain committed to preserving the simplicity that customers love about Azure Monitor Application Insights. The **Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro** is all that’s required to get started. It’s just a single NuGet package and you configure it with a Connection String. Telemetry flows in minutes.\n\nNo Collector is required unless you explicitly want one. We are able to achieve this with extensive **built‑in sampling** to manage cost and **a trace‑preservation algorithm,** so you see complete traces. This keeps the “just works” spirit of Azure Monitor Application Insights intact, while aligning with OpenTelemetry standards.\n\n# Feedback\n\nIf you encounter issues during the upgrade, please open a support ticket—we want the migration to be smooth.
