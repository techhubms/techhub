  "EnhancedContent": "## Continuous Azure Well-Architected Framework compliance validation using AI - autonomous resource discovery, org practice enforcement, and one-click remediation via Model Context Protocol.\n\nAzure governance at scale is complex. Security teams manually review many resource types across multiple subscriptions. Finance can't track costs without tags. Compliance teams spend days cross-referencing WAF standards against actual infrastructure. And critical security gaps - like RDP open to 0.0.0.0/0 or customer-managed encryption disabled - slip through until discovered in audits.\n\nThis workflow is broken. Enter the **Azure SRE Agent**: an AI-powered compliance engine that discovers all resources, assesses them against all 5 WAF pillars AND your organization's specific standards in minutes, then generates exact remediation commands with quantified impact.\n\n**How it works:**\n\nThe agent leverages these capabilities to transform Azure governance:\n\n**Autonomous Resource Discovery via MCP** - Azure MCP (Model Context Protocol) server exposes Azure Resource Graph and ARM APIs as discoverable tools. The agent automatically inventories all resources across subscriptions with metadata (types, locations, tags, security settings) in seconds.\n\n**Multi-Pillar WAF Assessment** - For each discovered resource, the agent validates against all 5 WAF pillars (Reliability, Security, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance) using Azure MCP tools, generating an assessment summary with pass/fail/partial/unknown counts.\n\n**Org Best Practices Cross-Check** - The agent references your organization's compliance standards (stored in knowledge base as org-practices.md) to escalate WAF findings into actionable org policies. A Security policy violation becomes a critical finding. A cost optimization recommendation becomes a warning.\n\n**Automated Remediation Codegen** - For every finding, the agent generates exact Azure CLI commands, Terraform snippets, and Portal steps with impact quantification (risk reduction, cost savings, compliance improvement).\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe Azure SRE Agent orchestrates WAF compliance checks by calling Azure MCP tools to discover and assess resources, then cross-references findings with organizational best practices from the knowledge base. End-to-end: subscription scope → resource discovery → 5-pillar assessment → org compliance → remediation commands.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe Azure MCP server runs locally via Node.js in **Stdio mode**, communicating with the SRE Agent through standard input/output. Configured with Managed Identity credentials, it exposes Azure ARM and governance APIs as MPC tools. The agent uses this catalog plus the org practices knowledge base to validate compliance autonomously.\n\n**Scheduling Options:**\n\n- **Ad-hoc**: Run on-demand via agent prompt\n- **Scheduled**: Use Azure SRE Agent's built-in task scheduler (daily/weekly/monthly compliance scans)\n- **Event-driven**: Trigger on resource group changes or policy violations\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Configure Azure MCP Connector**:\n\n**Connection Type**: Stdio (local process)\n\n**Command**: npx\n\n**Arguments** (in order):\n\n- -y (auto-accept)\n- [azure​](javascript:void%280%29)/mcp (package name)\n- server (run as server)\n- start (start command)\n- --mode (mode flag)\n- all (enable all resources)\n\n**Environment Variables**:\n\n- AZURE\\_CLIENT\\_ID: Your managed identity client ID\n- AZURE\\_TOKEN\\_CREDENTIALS: managedidentitycredential\n\n**Managed Identity**: Select your managed identity from dropdown\n\n**Configure Azure SRE Agent**:\n\n- Upload Knowledge Base from Builder &gt; Knowledge Base using the org practices doc: [org-practices.md](https://github.com/jvargh/sre-a/blob/main/databricks-srea/org-practices.md)\n- Benefit: Agent validates Azure resources against both WAF standards AND your company-specific requirements\n- Deploy the agent YAML: [Azure_WAF_Compliance_Agent.yaml,](https://github.com/jvargh/sre-a/blob/main/databricks-srea/Azure_WAF_Compliance_Agent.yaml) attach the Azure MCP and associate agent with the KB article.\n- Benefit: Autonomous resource discovery + 5-pillar assessment + org compliance in one execution\n\n**Run Your First Validation**:\n\nPrompt the agent with your subscription or resource group:\n\n**Integrate with Operations**:\n\n- Schedule daily compliance scans via Azure SRE Agent's scheduled tasks\n- Trigger assessments on resource deployments\n- Export findings to Azure DevOps or ServiceNow for ticketing\n\n## Autonomous Compliance Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Resource Discovery\n\n**Agent Task:**\n\nThe agent automatically discovers all resources in the target resource group, including VMs, storage accounts, NSGs, Key Vaults, App Services, and more - no manual resource IDs needed.\n\n**What the Agent Does:**\n\nCalls Azure MCP tools in parallel:\n\n- list\\_virtual\\_machines() - Inventory compute\n- list\\_storage\\_accounts() - Inventory storage\n- list\\_network\\_security\\_groups() - Inventory network security\n- list\\_key\\_vaults() - Inventory secrets management\n- list\\_web\\_apps() - Inventory App Services\n- Additional resource type queries as needed\n\nBuilds comprehensive resource inventory with metadata (types, locations, tags, configurations)\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n### Phase 2: Multi-Pillar WAF Assessment\n\n**Agent Task:**\n\nFor each discovered resource, the agent validates against all 5 Azure Well-Architected Framework pillars using Azure MCP tools.\n\n**What the Agent Does:**\n\n**Reliability Pillar:**\n\n- VM availability zones, backup configuration, health probes\n- Storage redundancy (LRS vs GRS vs ZRS)\n- App Service health checks and auto-healing\n\n**Security Pillar:**\n\n- NSG rules: Check for 0.0.0.0/0 sources on SSH/RDP\n- Key Vault: Secret expiration dates, soft delete, purge protection\n- Storage: Public blob access, shared key access, HTTPS enforcement, TLS version\n- App Service: HTTPS-only, managed identity, VNet integration\n\n**Cost Optimization Pillar:**\n\n- VM right-sizing: CPU/memory utilization analysis\n- Orphaned resources: Unattached disks, unused public IPs\n- Resource tagging: cost-center, owner, environment tags\n- Storage tiering opportunities\n\n**Operational Excellence Pillar:**\n\n- Monitoring: Azure Monitor diagnostics enabled\n- Logging: Log Analytics workspace integration\n- IaC: Resource tags indicating Terraform/Bicep management\n\n**Performance Pillar:**\n\n- VM series appropriateness for workload\n- Storage account performance tier\n- App Service plan scaling configuration\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n### Phase 3: Org Best Practices Cross-Check\n\n**Agent Task:**\n\nCross-reference all WAF findings with organizational requirements from org-practices.md knowledge base. Escalate violations of company-specific standards.\n\n**What the Agent Does:**\n\nReads org-practices.md from knowledge base\n\nFor each WAF finding, checks if it intersects with org requirement\n\nMaps severity based on org standards:\n\n- 🔴 **Critical**: NSG open to 0.0.0.0/0, Key Vault secrets expiring &lt; 30 days, storage public access enabled\n- 🟡 **Warning**: Missing required tags (cost-center, owner), idle VMs, orphaned disks\n- 🔵 **Info**: Recommendations without org mandate\n\nProvides specific evidence and references to org-practices.md sections\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n### Phase 4: Remediation with Exact Commands\n\n**Agent Task:**\n\nGenerate copy-paste CLI commands, Terraform snippets, and Portal steps for every gap. Quantify impact (cost savings, risk reduction).\n\n**What the Agent Does:**\n\n1. For each finding, generates precise fix commands\n2. Provides Azure CLI, PowerShell, or Terraform as appropriate\n3. Quantifies impact: cost reduction, security risk level, compliance improvement\n\n**Expected Output:**\n\n### Remediation Roadmap\n\n**Immediate (Deploy Today - Critical Risk):**\n\n1. Enable TLS 1.2 minimum on SQL Server prod-sql-server-01 (2 min)\n2. Fix NSG \"nsg-aks-nodes\" - Remove RDP from 0.0.0.0/0 (5 min)\n3. Enable SQL Server Auditing (10 min)\n4.
