This generation introduces several controls that change both security posture and operational readiness:\n\n- - **Hardware-Enforced Memory Isolation**: AMD SEV-SNP provides full, AES-128 encrypted memory with keys generated and managed by the onboard AMD Secure Processor.\n- **Online key rotation**: Support for the online key rotation with the introduction of Virtual Machine Metablob disk (VMMD).\n- **Programmatic Attestation for Audit and Zero-Trust**: Before provisioning any workload, customers can perform an attestation. This cryptographic procedure validates the integrity of the hardware and software, producing a signed report that proves the VM is a genuine confidential instance.\n- **Confidential OS Disk Encryption with Flexible Key Management**: Cryptographic protection extends beyond runtime memory to the operating system disk itself. The disk's encryption keys are bound to the VM's virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM), which is protected within the TEE. Customers can choose between platform-managed keys (PMK) for simplicity and regulatory ease, or customer-managed keys (CKM) for full, sovereign control over the key lifecycle - a common requirement for the most stringent compliance regimes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith the DCasv6 and ECasv6-series virtual machines now generally available in **Azure government regions**, customers can modernize their infrastructure deployments through confidential computing which replaces implicit trust with cryptographic isolation, and when deployed on Azure Government’s sovereign cloud within physically isolated data centers, it enables agencies to modernize at operational speed without compromising control.\n\nAzure Government is in a unique position to deliver the full operational depth of a hyperscale cloud, from identity and DevOps to monitoring and edge execution, inside an environment purpose-built for federal compliance. When combined with the latest Confidential VMs, customers gain secure infrastructure built on a platform where agility, visibility, and trust reinforce each other.\n\nAdditional resources\n\n- [Azure Government documentation | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-government/)\n- [Government Validation System](https://usgovintake.embark.microsoft.com/)\n\nUpdated Feb 13, 2026\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[acc](/tag/acc?nodeId=board%3AAzureConfidentialComputingBlog)\n\n[amd sev-snp](/tag/amd%20sev-snp?nodeId=board%3AAzureConfidentialComputingBlog)\n\n[cvm](/tag/cvm?nodeId=board%3AAzureConfidentialComputingBlog)\n\n[updates](/tag/updates?nodeId=board%3AAzureConfidentialComputingBlog)\n\n[!\\[Rakeshginjupalli&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMzg5MDQ0LWhPZXJQSQ?image-coordinates=0%2C484%2C1851%2C2335&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/rakeshginjupalli/1389044) [Rakeshginjupalli](/users/rakeshginjupalli/1389044) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined May 12, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/rakeshginjupalli/1389044)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azureconfidentialcomputingblog [Azure Confidential Computing Blog](/category/azure/blog/azureconfidentialcomputingblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
