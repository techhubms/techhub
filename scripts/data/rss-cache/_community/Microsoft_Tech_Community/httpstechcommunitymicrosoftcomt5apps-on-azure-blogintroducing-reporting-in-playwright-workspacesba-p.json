If you’re using [Playwright Workspaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-testing/playwright-workspaces/overview-what-is-microsoft-playwright-workspaces) (part of [Azure App Testing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-testing/)) to run Playwright tests at scale, this update brings you –\n\n- **Streamlined access** to all your test reports through the Azure portal.\n- Greater control over your test artifacts with the **bring-your-own-storage** capability.\n- **Customizable data governance** including retention, security, and compliance settings.\n- **Easy collaboration** with team members using shareable test report URLs.\n\nWhat’s new in Playwright Workspaces Reporting:\n\n## Integrated Reporting Experience in the Azure Portal\n\nAll your test reports are accessible in one place, right within the Azure portal. As soon as your Playwright tests finish running, the results and test artifacts are available in the Test Runs page in your Playwright Workspace – no need to pull files from CI or scour different logs.\n\nDebugging test failures is now more visual and intuitive. Playwright’s Trace Viewer is integrated directly into the test report, so you can time-travel through a failing test, step by step. Open any failed or flaky test and you’ll see a rich timeline of actions: hover over each step to reveal the page state before and after each action. Detailed logs, DOM snapshots, network activity, errors, and console output are available at each test step for better troubleshooting.\n\nScreen capture of reporting in Playwright Workspaces.\n\n## Flexible Data Governance with Bring Your Own Storage\n\nIn this release, you have full control over where your test reports and artifacts live. Playwright Workspaces now lets you link your own Azure Storage account to store test results, traces, videos, and screenshots. With this update, you get to define your data retention, security, and compliance settings. For example, you might plug in an Azure Blob Storage container under your company’s account – all test artifacts will be saved there, under your organization’s preset governance.\n\nThe bring-your-own-storage approach gives teams flexibility to meet enterprise policies or cost management goals. Once connected, the dashboard will seamlessly pull reports from your storage, so the experience remains smooth.\n\nScreen capture of linking your storage account to your Playwright Workspace.\n\n## Collaborate Seamlessly with Team Members\n\nUsing the centralised test report experience enables you to easily manage and share access to your test reports. You can also see the URL to the test report as a part of your CI logs. Share this test report URL with your team members to debug failed or flaky tests faster. Having a single source of truth for test results not only saves time but also reduces miscommunication during crunch times.\n\nWe’re excited about how the new reporting capability in Playwright Workspaces will empower teams to ship with greater confidence. By combining scalable test execution with a centralised, fully controllable and collaborative test results experience, Playwright Workspaces takes debugging and test results reporting to the next level.\n\nHappy Testing and Debugging with Playwright Workspaces Reporting!\n\n## Get Started with Reporting in Playwright Workspaces\n\nReady to take the new reporting feature for a spin?
