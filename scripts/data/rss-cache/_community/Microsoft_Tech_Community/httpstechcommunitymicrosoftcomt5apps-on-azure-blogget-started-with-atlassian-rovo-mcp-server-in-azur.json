  "Description": "# Get started with Atlassian Rovo MCP server in Azure SRE Agent\n\nConnect Azure SRE Agent to Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management using the official Atlassian Rovo MCP server.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Atlassian Rovo MCP server is a cloud-hosted bridge between your Atlassian Cloud site and Azure SRE Agent. Once configured, it enables real-time interaction with Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management data through natural language. All actions respect your existing Atlassian user permissions.\n\nThe server supports two authentication methods: **OAuth 2.1** (browser-based) for interactive scenarios, and **API token** (Basic or Bearer auth) for headless or automated setups. Azure SRE Agent connects using Streamable-HTTP transport directly to the Atlassian-hosted endpoint—no npm packages, local proxies, or container deployments are required.\n\n### Key capabilities\n\n| Product | Capabilities | | --- | --- | | **Jira** | Search issues with JQL, create/update tickets, add comments and worklogs, transition issues through workflows | | **Confluence** | Search pages with CQL, create/update pages and live docs, manage inline and footer comments | | **Compass** | Create/delete service components and relationships, manage custom fields, query dependencies | | **Jira Service Management** | Query ops alerts, view on-call schedules, get team info, escalate alerts | | **Rovo Search** | Natural language search across Jira and Confluence, fetch content by ARI |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is the official Atlassian-hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp`\n> . The server exposes **46+ tools** across five product areas. Tool availability depends on authentication method and granted scopes.\n> >\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Azure SRE Agent resource deployed in Azure\n- Atlassian Cloud site with one or more of: Jira, Confluence, Compass, or Jira Service Management\n- User account with appropriate permissions in the Atlassian products you want to access\n- **For OAuth 2.1**: Modern browser to complete the authorization flow\n- **For API token auth**: Organization admin must [enable API token authentication](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/control-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-settings/) in the Rovo MCP server settings\n\n## Step 1: Get your Atlassian credentials\n\nChoose one of the two authentication methods below. API token (Option A) is recommended for Azure SRE Agent because it enables headless configuration without browser-based flows.\n\n### Option A: Personal API token (recommended for Azure SRE Agent)\n\nAPI token authentication allows headless configuration without browser-based OAuth flows—ideal for Azure SRE Agent connectors.\n\n#### Navigate to the API token page\n\n1. Log in to your [Atlassian account](https://id.atlassian.com/)\n2. Select your **profile avatar** in the top-right corner\n3. Select **Manage account**\n4. In the left sidebar, select **Security**\n5. Under the **API tokens** section, you can manage your existing tokens\n\nAlternatively, use this direct link that pre-selects all MCP scopes:\n\n> >\n> **Direct URL:** [Create API token with all MCP scopes](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens?autofillToken&expiryDays=max&appId=mcp&selectedScopes=all)\n> >\n\n#### Create the token\n\n1. Navigate to the [Atlassian API token creation page](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens?autofillToken&expiryDays=max&appId=mcp&selectedScopes=all) to create a token with all MCP scopes preselected\n2. Optionally click **Back** to manually select only the scopes you need (see Available scopes)\n3. Copy the generated token and note the email address associated with your Atlassian account\n4. Base64-encode your credentials:\n\n```\n# Format: email:api_token\necho -n \"your.email@example.com:YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\" | base64\n\n```\n\nOn Windows PowerShell:\n\n``` [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes(\"your.email@example.com:YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\"))\n\n```\n\nThis produces a base64-encoded string you'll use in the connector configuration as the `Authorization: Basic ` header.\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Store the API token securely. It cannot be viewed again after creation. If lost, generate a new token from the same [API tokens page](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).\n> > >\n> [!NOTE]\n> API token authentication must be enabled by your organization admin. If you cannot create a token, ask your admin to [enable API token authentication](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/control-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-settings/) in the Rovo MCP server settings at **admin.atlassian.com** > **Security** > **Rovo MCP server**.\n> >\n\n### Option B: OAuth 2.1 (browser-based)\n\nOAuth 2.1 uses interactive browser consent. When the agent first invokes an Atlassian tool:\n\n1. A browser window opens automatically for the Atlassian consent screen\n2. Log in with your Atlassian account and authorize the requested products\n3. The session remains valid until the token expires or is revoked\n\n> >\n> [!TIP]\n> If you're the first user in your organization to connect, a site admin may need to complete the initial Three-Legged OAuth (3LO) consent flow before other users can authorize.\n> >\n\n### Available scopes\n\nThe API token supports the following scope categories:\n\n| Category | Scopes | | --- | --- | | **Jira** | `read:jira-work`<br>, `write:jira-work`<br>, `read:jira-user` | | **Confluence** | `read:page:confluence`<br>, `write:page:confluence`<br>, `read:comment:confluence`<br>, `write:comment:confluence`<br>, `read:space:confluence`<br>, `read:hierarchical-content:confluence`<br>, `read:confluence-user`<br>, `search:confluence` | | **Compass** | `read:component:compass`<br>, `write:component:compass` | | **JSM** | `read:incident:jira-service-management`<br>, `write:incident:jira-service-management`<br>, `read:ops-alert:jira-service-management`<br>, `write:ops-alert:jira-service-management`<br>, `read:ops-config:jira-service-management`<br>, `read:servicedesk-request` | | **Bitbucket** | `read:repository:bitbucket`<br>, `write:repository:bitbucket`<br>, `read:pullrequest:bitbucket`<br>, `write:pullrequest:bitbucket`<br>, `read:pipeline:bitbucket`<br>, `write:pipeline:bitbucket`<br>, `read:user:bitbucket`<br>, `read:workspace:bitbucket`<br>, `admin:repository:bitbucket` | | **Platform** | `read:me`<br>, `read:account`<br>, `search:rovo:mcp` |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> Bitbucket scopes are available in the token, but Bitbucket tools are not yet listed on the [official supported tools page](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-rovo-mcp-server/docs/supported-tools/). Bitbucket tool support may be added in a future update.\n> >\n\n## Step 2: Add the MCP connector\n\nConnect the Atlassian Rovo MCP server to your SRE Agent using the portal.\n\n### Using the Azure portal (API token auth)\n\n1. In Azure portal, navigate to your SRE Agent resource\n2. Select **Builder** > **Connectors**\n3. Select **Add connector**\n4. Select **MCP server** (User provided connector) and select **Next**\n\n![Select ](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/atlassian-02-select-mcp-connector.png)\n\n1. Configure the connector:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Name** | `atlassian-rovo-mcp` | | **Connection type** | Streamable-HTTP | | **URL** | `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` | | **Authentication** | Custom headers | | **Header Key** | `Authorization` | | **Header Value** | `Basic ` |\n\n1. Select **Next** to review\n\n![Configure the MCP server connector with the Atlassian endpoint URL and custom Authorization header](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/atlassian-03-mcp-config-form.png)\n\n1. Select **Add connector**\n\n### Using the Azure portal (OAuth 2.1)\n\n1. Follow the same steps as above, but set:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Name** | `atlassian-rovo-mcp` | | **Connection type** | Streamable-HTTP | | **URL** | `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` | | **Authentication** | OAuth 2.0 |\n\n1. The first time you invoke a tool, a browser window opens for OAuth consent\n\n### Using the Azure portal (Service account)\n\nFor service accounts managed by an admin, use Bearer auth:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Header Key** | `Authorization` | | **Header Value** | `Bearer ` |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> Once the connector shows **Connected** status, the Atlassian MCP tools are automatically available to your agent. You can verify by checking the tools list in the connector details.\n> >\n\n![Connectors list showing atlassian-rovo-mcp with Connected status](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/atlassian-01-connectors-list.png)\n\n## Step 3: Create an Atlassian subagent (optional)\n\nCreate a specialized subagent to give the AI focused Atlassian expertise and better prompt responses.\n\n1. Navigate to **Builder** > **Subagents**\n2. Select **Add subagent**\n3. Paste the following YAML configuration:\n\n``` api_version: azuresre.ai/v1 kind: AgentConfiguration metadata: owner: your-team@contoso.com version: \"1.0.0\" spec: name: AtlassianRovoExpert display_name: Atlassian Rovo Expert\n\nsystem_prompt: | You are an Atlassian expert with access to Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management via the Atlassian Rovo MCP server.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n### Jira\n- Search issues using JQL (Jira Query Language) with `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`\n- Create, update, and transition issues through workflows\n- Add comments, worklogs, and manage issue metadata\n- Look up user account IDs and project configurations\n\n### Confluence\n- Search pages and content using CQL (Confluence Query Language) with `searchConfluenceUsingCql`\n- Create and update pages and live docs with Markdown content\n- Add inline and footer comments on pages\n- Navigate spaces and page hierarchies\n\n### Compass\n- Create, query, and delete service components (services, libraries, applications)\n- Define and manage relationships between components\n- Manage custom field definitions and component metadata\n- View component activity events (deployments, alerts)\n\n### Jira Service Management\n- Query ops alerts by ID, alias, or search criteria\n- View on-call schedules and current/next responders\n- Get team info including escalation policies and roles\n- Acknowledge, close, or escalate alerts\n\n### Cross-Product\n- Use Rovo Search (`search`) for natural language queries across Jira and Confluence\n- Fetch specific content by Atlassian Resource Identifier (ARI) using `fetch`\n- Get current user info and list accessible cloud sites\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen searching Jira:\n- Use JQL for precise queries: `project = \"MYPROJ\" AND status = \"Open\"`\n- Start with broad searches, then refine based on results\n- Use `currentUser()` for user-relative queries\n- Use `openSprints()` for active sprint work\n\nWhen searching Confluence:\n- Use CQL for structured searches: `space = \"ENG\" AND type = page`\n- Use Rovo Search for natural language queries when JQL/CQL isn't needed\n- Consider space keys to narrow results\n\nWhen creating content:\n- Confirm project/space/issue type with the user before creating\n- Use `getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields` to check required fields\n- Use `getConfluenceSpaces` to list available spaces\n\nWhen handling errors:\n- If access is denied, explain what permission is needed\n- Suggest the user contact their Atlassian administrator\n- For expired tokens, advise re-authentication\n\nmcp_connectors:\n- atlassian-rovo-mcp\n\nhandoffs: []\n\n```\n\n1. Select **Save**\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `mcp_connectors`\n> field references the connector name you created in Step 2. This gives the subagent access to all tools provided by the Atlassian Rovo MCP server.\n> >\n\n## Step 4: Add an Atlassian skill (optional)\n\nSkills provide contextual knowledge and best practices that help agents use tools more effectively. Create an Atlassian skill to give your agent expertise in JQL, CQL, and Atlassian workflows.\n\n1. Navigate to **Builder** > **Skills**\n2. Select **Add skill**\n3. Paste the following skill configuration:\n\n``` api_version: azuresre.ai/v1 kind: SkillConfiguration metadata: owner: your-team@contoso.com version: \"1.0.0\" spec: name: atlassian_rovo display_name: Atlassian Rovo\n\ndescription: | Expertise in Atlassian Cloud products including Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management. Use for searching issues with JQL, creating and updating pages, managing service components, investigating ops alerts, and navigating Atlassian workspaces via the Rovo MCP server.\n\ninstructions: |\n## Overview\n\nAtlassian Cloud provides integrated tools for project tracking (Jira), documentation (Confluence), service catalog management (Compass), and incident management (Jira Service Management). The Atlassian Rovo MCP server enables natural language interaction with all four products.\n\n**Authentication:** OAuth 2.1 or API token (Basic/Bearer). All actions respect existing user permissions.\n\n## Searching Jira with JQL\n\nJQL (Jira Query Language) enables precise issue searches. Always use `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` for structured queries.\n\n**Common JQL patterns:**\n\n```jql\n# Open issues assigned to current user\nassignee = currentUser() AND status != Done\n\n# Bugs created in the last 7 days\nproject = \"MYPROJ\" AND type = Bug AND created >= -7d\n\n# High-priority issues in active sprints\nproject = \"MYPROJ\" AND priority in (High, Highest) AND sprint in openSprints()\n\n# Full-text search\nproject = \"MYPROJ\" AND text ~ \"payment error\"\n\n# Issues updated recently\nupdated >= -24h ORDER BY updated DESC ```\n\n**JQL operators:** `=`, `!=`, `~` (contains), `in`, `>=`, `\n\n**JQL functions:** `currentUser()`, `openSprints()`, `startOfDay()`, `endOfDay()`, `membersOf(\"group\")`\n\n## Searching Confluence with CQL\n\nCQL (Confluence Query Language) searches pages, blog posts, and attachments. Use `searchConfluenceUsingCql` for structured queries.\n\n**Common CQL patterns:**\n\n```cql\n# Search by title\ntitle ~ \"Architecture\"\n\n# Search in specific space\nspace = \"ENG\" AND type = page\n\n# Full-text content search\ntext ~ \"deployment pipeline\"\n\n# Recently modified pages\nlastModified >= now(\"-7d\") AND type = page\n\n# Pages by label\nlabel = \"runbook\" AND space = \"SRE\" ```\n\n**CQL fields:** `title`, `text`, `space`, `type`, `label`, `creator`, `lastModified`\n\n## Creating Jira Issues\n\nFollow this workflow:\n1. `getVisibleJiraProjects` — list available projects\n2. `getJiraProjectIssueTypesMetadata` — list issue types for the project\n3. `getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields` — get required/optional fields\n4. `createJiraIssue` — create the issue\n\nCommon issue types: Story, Bug, Task, Epic, Sub-task.\n\n## Creating Confluence Pages\n\nPages support Markdown content:\n1. `getConfluenceSpaces` — list available spaces\n2. `getPagesInConfluenceSpace` — optionally find a parent page\n3. `createConfluencePage` — create the page with space, title, and body\n\n## Working with Compass Components\n\nComponent types: SERVICE, LIBRARY, APPLICATION, CAPABILITY, CLOUD_RESOURCE, DATA_PIPELINE, MACHINE_LEARNING_MODEL, UI_ELEMENT, WEBSITE, OTHER.\n\nRelationship types: DEPENDS_ON, OTHER.\n\n## Jira Service Management Operations\n\nFor incident and alert management:\n- `getJsmOpsAlerts` — query alerts by ID, alias, or search\n- `updateJsmOpsAlert` — acknowledge, close, or escalate alerts\n- `getJsmOpsScheduleInfo` — view on-call schedules and responders\n- `getJsmOpsTeamInfo` — list teams with escalation policies\n\n## Cross-Product Workflows\n\n- Use `search` (Rovo Search) for natural language queries across products\n- Use `fetch` with ARIs (Atlassian Resource Identifiers) for direct content retrieval\n- Use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` to list cloud sites and get cloudIds\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Solution | |-------|----------| | JQL syntax error | Check field names; quote values with spaces | | CQL returns no results | Verify space key; try broader terms | | Cannot create issue | Verify \"Create\" permission in the project | | Cannot edit page | Verify \"Edit\" permission in the space | | OAuth expired | Re-invoke any tool to trigger fresh OAuth flow | | \"Site admin must authorize\" | Admin must complete initial 3LO consent | | cloudId errors | Use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` to find correct cloudId |\n\nmcp_connectors:\n- atlassian-rovo-mcp\n\n```\n\n1. Select **Save**\n\n### Reference the skill in your subagent\n\nUpdate your subagent configuration to include the skill:\n\n``` spec: name: AtlassianRovoExpert skills:\n- atlassian_rovo\nmcp_connectors:\n- atlassian-rovo-mcp\n\n```\n\n## Step 5: Test the integration\n\n1. Open a new chat session with your SRE Agent\n2. Try these example prompts:\n\n### Jira workflows\n\n``` Find all open bugs assigned to me in the PAYMENTS project\n\nCreate a new story in project PLATFORM titled \"Implement rate limiting for API gateway\"\n\nShow me the available transitions for issue PLATFORM-1234\n\nAdd a comment to PLATFORM-1234: \"Reviewed and approved for deployment\"\n\nLog 2 hours of work on PLATFORM-1234 with

Go to [id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/apps](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/apps)\n2. Find and revoke the MCP app authorization\n3. Generate a new API token or re-invoke a tool to trigger fresh OAuth flow\n\n## Limitations\n\n| Limitation | Details | | --- | --- | | **Limited tool availability with API tokens** | Some tools (e.g., certain Compass tools) may not be available because required scopes aren't available for API tokens | | **No bounded cloudId** | API tokens are not bound to a specific cloudId. Tools must explicitly pass the cloudId where needed | | **No domain allowlist validation** | API token auth doesn't use OAuth redirect URIs, so domain allowlist checks cannot be performed | | **Bitbucket tools** | Bitbucket scopes are available in the token, but Bitbucket tools are not yet listed as supported | | **JSM requires API token** | Jira Service Management tools only work with API token authentication, not OAuth 2.1 |\n\n## Security considerations\n\n### How permissions work\n\n- **User-scoped**: All actions respect the authenticated user's existing Atlassian permissions\n- **Product-level**: Access requires matching product permissions (Jira, Confluence, Compass)\n- **Session-based**: OAuth tokens expire and require re-authentication; API tokens persist until revoked\n\n### Data security\n\n- All traffic encrypted via HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)\n- IP allowlisting rules apply if configured in Atlassian Administration\n- Audit logging captures key actions performed via the MCP server\n\n### Admin controls\n\nAtlassian administrators can:\n- Enable or disable API token authentication in [Rovo MCP server settings](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/control-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-settings/)\n- Manage and revoke MCP app access from the Connected Apps list\n- Control which external domains can connect via domain allowlists\n- Monitor activity through [Atlassian audit logs](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/monitor-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-activity/)\n- Configure IP allowlisting for additional security\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> MCP clients can perform actions in Jira, Confluence, and Compass with your existing permissions. Use least privilege, review high-impact changes before confirming, and monitor audit logs for unusual activity.

  "EnhancedContent": "# Get started with Atlassian Rovo MCP server in Azure SRE Agent\n\nConnect Azure SRE Agent to Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management using the official Atlassian Rovo MCP server.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Atlassian Rovo MCP server is a cloud-hosted bridge between your Atlassian Cloud site and Azure SRE Agent. Once configured, it enables real-time interaction with Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management data through natural language. All actions respect your existing Atlassian user permissions.\n\nThe server supports two authentication methods: **OAuth 2.1** (browser-based) for interactive scenarios, and **API token** (Basic or Bearer auth) for headless or automated setups. Azure SRE Agent connects using Streamable-HTTP transport directly to the Atlassian-hosted endpoint—no npm packages, local proxies, or container deployments are required.\n\n### Key capabilities\n\n| Product | Capabilities | | --- | --- | | **Jira** | Search issues with JQL, create/update tickets, add comments and worklogs, transition issues through workflows | | **Confluence** | Search pages with CQL, create/update pages and live docs, manage inline and footer comments | | **Compass** | Create/delete service components and relationships, manage custom fields, query dependencies | | **Jira Service Management** | Query ops alerts, view on-call schedules, get team info, escalate alerts | | **Rovo Search** | Natural language search across Jira and Confluence, fetch content by ARI |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is the official Atlassian-hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp`\n> . The server exposes **46+ tools** across five product areas. Tool availability depends on authentication method and granted scopes.\n> >\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Azure SRE Agent resource deployed in Azure\n- Atlassian Cloud site with one or more of: Jira, Confluence, Compass, or Jira Service Management\n- User account with appropriate permissions in the Atlassian products you want to access\n- **For OAuth 2.1**: Modern browser to complete the authorization flow\n- **For API token auth**: Organization admin must [enable API token authentication](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/control-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-settings/) in the Rovo MCP server settings\n\n## Step 1: Get your Atlassian credentials\n\nChoose one of the two authentication methods below. API token (Option A) is recommended for Azure SRE Agent because it enables headless configuration without browser-based flows.\n\n### Option A: Personal API token (recommended for Azure SRE Agent)\n\nAPI token authentication allows headless configuration without browser-based OAuth flows—ideal for Azure SRE Agent connectors.\n\n#### Navigate to the API token page\n\n1. Log in to your [Atlassian account](https://id.atlassian.com/)\n2. Select your **profile avatar** in the top-right corner\n3. Select **Manage account**\n4. In the left sidebar, select **Security**\n5. Under the **API tokens** section, you can manage your existing tokens\n\nAlternatively, use this direct link that pre-selects all MCP scopes:\n\n> >\n> **Direct URL:** [Create API token with all MCP scopes](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens?autofillToken&amp;expiryDays=max&amp;appId=mcp&amp;selectedScopes=all)\n> >\n\n#### Create the token\n\n1. Navigate to the [Atlassian API token creation page](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens?autofillToken&amp;expiryDays=max&amp;appId=mcp&amp;selectedScopes=all) to create a token with all MCP scopes preselected\n2. Optionally click **Back** to manually select only the scopes you need (see Available scopes)\n3. Copy the generated token and note the email address associated with your Atlassian account\n4. Base64-encode your credentials:\n\n```\n# Format: email:api_token\necho -n \"your.email@example.com:YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\" | base64\n\n```\n\nOn Windows PowerShell:\n\n``` [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes(\"your.email@example.com:YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\"))\n\n```\n\nThis produces a base64-encoded string you'll use in the connector configuration as the `Authorization: Basic <value>` header.\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Store the API token securely. It cannot be viewed again after creation. If lost, generate a new token from the same [API tokens page](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).\n> > >\n> [!NOTE]\n> API token authentication must be enabled by your organization admin. If you cannot create a token, ask your admin to [enable API token authentication](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/control-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-settings/) in the Rovo MCP server settings at **admin.atlassian.com** &gt; **Security** &gt; **Rovo MCP server**.\n> >\n\n### Option B: OAuth 2.1 (browser-based)\n\nOAuth 2.1 uses interactive browser consent. When the agent first invokes an Atlassian tool:\n\n1. A browser window opens automatically for the Atlassian consent screen\n2. Log in with your Atlassian account and authorize the requested products\n3. The session remains valid until the token expires or is revoked\n\n> >\n> [!TIP]\n> If you're the first user in your organization to connect, a site admin may need to complete the initial Three-Legged OAuth (3LO) consent flow before other users can authorize.\n> >\n\n### Available scopes\n\nThe API token supports the following scope categories:\n\n| Category | Scopes | | --- | --- | | **Jira** | `read:jira-work`<br>, `write:jira-work`<br>, `read:jira-user` | | **Confluence** | `read:page:confluence`<br>, `write:page:confluence`<br>, `read:comment:confluence`<br>, `write:comment:confluence`<br>, `read:space:confluence`<br>, `read:hierarchical-content:confluence`<br>, `read:confluence-user`<br>, `search:confluence` | | **Compass** | `read:component:compass`<br>, `write:component:compass` | | **JSM** | `read:incident:jira-service-management`<br>, `write:incident:jira-service-management`<br>, `read:ops-alert:jira-service-management`<br>, `write:ops-alert:jira-service-management`<br>, `read:ops-config:jira-service-management`<br>, `read:servicedesk-request` | | **Bitbucket** | `read:repository:bitbucket`<br>, `write:repository:bitbucket`<br>, `read:pullrequest:bitbucket`<br>, `write:pullrequest:bitbucket`<br>, `read:pipeline:bitbucket`<br>, `write:pipeline:bitbucket`<br>, `read:user:bitbucket`<br>, `read:workspace:bitbucket`<br>, `admin:repository:bitbucket` | | **Platform** | `read:me`<br>, `read:account`<br>, `search:rovo:mcp` |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> Bitbucket scopes are available in the token, but Bitbucket tools are not yet listed on the [official supported tools page](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-rovo-mcp-server/docs/supported-tools/). Bitbucket tool support may be added in a future update.\n> >\n\n## Step 2: Add the MCP connector\n\nConnect the Atlassian Rovo MCP server to your SRE Agent using the portal.\n\n### Using the Azure portal (API token auth)\n\n1. In Azure portal, navigate to your SRE Agent resource\n2. Select **Builder** &gt; **Connectors**\n3. Select **Add connector**\n4. Select **MCP server** (User provided connector) and select **Next**\n\n![Select &quot;MCP server&quot; as the connector type in the Add a connector dialog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/atlassian-02-select-mcp-connector.png)\n\n1. Configure the connector:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Name** | `atlassian-rovo-mcp` | | **Connection type** | Streamable-HTTP | | **URL** | `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` | | **Authentication** | Custom headers | | **Header Key** | `Authorization` | | **Header Value** | `Basic <your_base64_encoded_email_and_token>` |\n\n1. Select **Next** to review\n\n![Configure the MCP server connector with the Atlassian endpoint URL and custom Authorization header](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/atlassian-03-mcp-config-form.png)\n\n1. Select **Add connector**\n\n### Using the Azure portal (OAuth 2.1)\n\n1. Follow the same steps as above, but set:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Name** | `atlassian-rovo-mcp` | | **Connection type** | Streamable-HTTP | | **URL** | `https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/mcp` | | **Authentication** | OAuth 2.0 |\n\n1. The first time you invoke a tool, a browser window opens for OAuth consent\n\n### Using the Azure portal (Service account)\n\nFor service accounts managed by an admin, use Bearer auth:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Header Key** | `Authorization` | | **Header Value** | `Bearer <your_service_account_api_key>` |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> Once the connector shows **Connected** status, the Atlassian MCP tools are automatically available to your agent. You can verify by checking the tools list in the connector details.\n> >\n\n![Connectors list showing atlassian-rovo-mcp with Connected status](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/atlassian-01-connectors-list.png)\n\n## Step 3: Create an Atlassian subagent (optional)\n\nCreate a specialized subagent to give the AI focused Atlassian expertise and better prompt responses.\n\n1. Navigate to **Builder** &gt; **Subagents**\n2. Select **Add subagent**\n3. Paste the following YAML configuration:\n\n``` api_version: azuresre.ai/v1 kind: AgentConfiguration metadata: owner: your-team@contoso.com version: \"1.0.0\" spec: name: AtlassianRovoExpert display_name: Atlassian Rovo Expert\n\nsystem_prompt: | You are an Atlassian expert with access to Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management via the Atlassian Rovo MCP server.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n### Jira\n- Search issues using JQL (Jira Query Language) with `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`\n- Create, update, and transition issues through workflows\n- Add comments, worklogs, and manage issue metadata\n- Look up user account IDs and project configurations\n\n### Confluence\n- Search pages and content using CQL (Confluence Query Language) with `searchConfluenceUsingCql`\n- Create and update pages and live docs with Markdown content\n- Add inline and footer comments on pages\n- Navigate spaces and page hierarchies\n\n### Compass\n- Create, query, and delete service components (services, libraries, applications)\n- Define and manage relationships between components\n- Manage custom field definitions and component metadata\n- View component activity events (deployments, alerts)\n\n### Jira Service Management\n- Query ops alerts by ID, alias, or search criteria\n- View on-call schedules and current/next responders\n- Get team info including escalation policies and roles\n- Acknowledge, close, or escalate alerts\n\n### Cross-Product\n- Use Rovo Search (`search`) for natural language queries across Jira and Confluence\n- Fetch specific content by Atlassian Resource Identifier (ARI) using `fetch`\n- Get current user info and list accessible cloud sites\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen searching Jira:\n- Use JQL for precise queries: `project = \"MYPROJ\" AND status = \"Open\"`\n- Start with broad searches, then refine based on results\n- Use `currentUser()` for user-relative queries\n- Use `openSprints()` for active sprint work\n\nWhen searching Confluence:\n- Use CQL for structured searches: `space = \"ENG\" AND type = page`\n- Use Rovo Search for natural language queries when JQL/CQL isn't needed\n- Consider space keys to narrow results\n\nWhen creating content:\n- Confirm project/space/issue type with the user before creating\n- Use `getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields` to check required fields\n- Use `getConfluenceSpaces` to list available spaces\n\nWhen handling errors:\n- If access is denied, explain what permission is needed\n- Suggest the user contact their Atlassian administrator\n- For expired tokens, advise re-authentication\n\nmcp_connectors:\n- atlassian-rovo-mcp\n\nhandoffs: []\n\n```\n\n1. Select **Save**\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `mcp_connectors`\n> field references the connector name you created in Step 2. This gives the subagent access to all tools provided by the Atlassian Rovo MCP server.\n> >\n\n## Step 4: Add an Atlassian skill (optional)\n\nSkills provide contextual knowledge and best practices that help agents use tools more effectively. Create an Atlassian skill to give your agent expertise in JQL, CQL, and Atlassian workflows.\n\n1. Navigate to **Builder** &gt; **Skills**\n2. Select **Add skill**\n3. Paste the following skill configuration:\n\n``` api_version: azuresre.ai/v1 kind: SkillConfiguration metadata: owner: your-team@contoso.com version: \"1.0.0\" spec: name: atlassian_rovo display_name: Atlassian Rovo\n\ndescription: | Expertise in Atlassian Cloud products including Jira, Confluence, Compass, and Jira Service Management. Use for searching issues with JQL, creating and updating pages, managing service components, investigating ops alerts, and navigating Atlassian workspaces via the Rovo MCP server.\n\ninstructions: |\n## Overview\n\nAtlassian Cloud provides integrated tools for project tracking (Jira), documentation (Confluence), service catalog management (Compass), and incident management (Jira Service Management). The Atlassian Rovo MCP server enables natural language interaction with all four products.\n\n**Authentication:** OAuth 2.1 or API token (Basic/Bearer). All actions respect existing user permissions.\n\n## Searching Jira with JQL\n\nJQL (Jira Query Language) enables precise issue searches. Always use `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` for structured queries.\n\n**Common JQL patterns:**\n\n```jql\n# Open issues assigned to current user\nassignee = currentUser() AND status != Done\n\n# Bugs created in the last 7 days\nproject = \"MYPROJ\" AND type = Bug AND created >= -7d\n\n# High-priority issues in active sprints\nproject = \"MYPROJ\" AND priority in (High, Highest) AND sprint in openSprints()\n\n# Full-text search\nproject = \"MYPROJ\" AND text ~ \"payment error\"\n\n# Issues updated recently\nupdated >= -24h ORDER BY updated DESC ```\n\n**JQL operators:** `=`, `!=`, `~` (contains), `in`, `>=`, `<=`, `NOT`, `AND`, `OR`\n\n**JQL functions:** `currentUser()`, `openSprints()`, `startOfDay()`, `endOfDay()`, `membersOf(\"group\")`\n\n## Searching Confluence with CQL\n\nCQL (Confluence Query Language) searches pages, blog posts, and attachments. Use `searchConfluenceUsingCql` for structured queries.\n\n**Common CQL patterns:**\n\n```cql\n# Search by title\ntitle ~ \"Architecture\"\n\n# Search in specific space\nspace = \"ENG\" AND type = page\n\n# Full-text content search\ntext ~ \"deployment pipeline\"\n\n# Recently modified pages\nlastModified >= now(\"-7d\") AND type = page\n\n# Pages by label\nlabel = \"runbook\" AND space = \"SRE\" ```\n\n**CQL fields:** `title`, `text`, `space`, `type`, `label`, `creator`, `lastModified`\n\n## Creating Jira Issues\n\nFollow this workflow:\n1. `getVisibleJiraProjects` — list available projects\n2. `getJiraProjectIssueTypesMetadata` — list issue types for the project\n3. `getJiraIssueTypeMetaWithFields` — get required/optional fields\n4. `createJiraIssue` — create the issue\n\nCommon issue types: Story, Bug, Task, Epic, Sub-task.\n\n## Creating Confluence Pages\n\nPages support Markdown content:\n1. `getConfluenceSpaces` — list available spaces\n2. `getPagesInConfluenceSpace` — optionally find a parent page\n3. `createConfluencePage` — create the page with space, title, and body\n\n## Working with Compass Components\n\nComponent types: SERVICE, LIBRARY, APPLICATION, CAPABILITY, CLOUD_RESOURCE, DATA_PIPELINE, MACHINE_LEARNING_MODEL, UI_ELEMENT, WEBSITE, OTHER.\n\nRelationship types: DEPENDS_ON, OTHER.\n\n## Jira Service Management Operations\n\nFor incident and alert management:\n- `getJsmOpsAlerts` — query alerts by ID, alias, or search\n- `updateJsmOpsAlert` — acknowledge, close, or escalate alerts\n- `getJsmOpsScheduleInfo` — view on-call schedules and responders\n- `getJsmOpsTeamInfo` — list teams with escalation policies\n\n## Cross-Product Workflows\n\n- Use `search` (Rovo Search) for natural language queries across products\n- Use `fetch` with ARIs (Atlassian Resource Identifiers) for direct content retrieval\n- Use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` to list cloud sites and get cloudIds\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue | Solution | |-------|----------| | JQL syntax error | Check field names; quote values with spaces | | CQL returns no results | Verify space key; try broader terms | | Cannot create issue | Verify \"Create\" permission in the project | | Cannot edit page | Verify \"Edit\" permission in the space | | OAuth expired | Re-invoke any tool to trigger fresh OAuth flow | | \"Site admin must authorize\" | Admin must complete initial 3LO consent | | cloudId errors | Use `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` to find correct cloudId |\n\nmcp_connectors:\n- atlassian-rovo-mcp\n\n```\n\n1. Select **Save**\n\n### Reference the skill in your subagent\n\nUpdate your subagent configuration to include the skill:\n\n``` spec: name: AtlassianRovoExpert skills:\n- atlassian_rovo\nmcp_connectors:\n- atlassian-rovo-mcp\n\n```\n\n## Step 5: Test the integration\n\n1. Open a new chat session with your SRE Agent\n2. Try these example prompts:\n\n### Jira workflows\n\n``` Find all open bugs assigned to me in the PAYMENTS project\n\nCreate a new story in project PLATFORM titled \"Implement rate limiting for API

Generate a new API token or re-invoke a tool to trigger fresh OAuth flow\n\n## Limitations\n\n| Limitation | Details | | --- | --- | | **Limited tool availability with API tokens** | Some tools (e.g., certain Compass tools) may not be available because required scopes aren't available for API tokens | | **No bounded cloudId** | API tokens are not bound to a specific cloudId. Tools must explicitly pass the cloudId where needed | | **No domain allowlist validation** | API token auth doesn't use OAuth redirect URIs, so domain allowlist checks cannot be performed | | **Bitbucket tools** | Bitbucket scopes are available in the token, but Bitbucket tools are not yet listed as supported | | **JSM requires API token** | Jira Service Management tools only work with API token authentication, not OAuth 2.1 |\n\n## Security considerations\n\n### How permissions work\n\n- **User-scoped**: All actions respect the authenticated user's existing Atlassian permissions\n- **Product-level**: Access requires matching product permissions (Jira, Confluence, Compass)\n- **Session-based**: OAuth tokens expire and require re-authentication; API tokens persist until revoked\n\n### Data security\n\n- All traffic encrypted via HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)\n- IP allowlisting rules apply if configured in Atlassian Administration\n- Audit logging captures key actions performed via the MCP server\n\n### Admin controls\n\nAtlassian administrators can:\n- Enable or disable API token authentication in [Rovo MCP server settings](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/control-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-settings/)\n- Manage and revoke MCP app access from the Connected Apps list\n- Control which external domains can connect via domain allowlists\n- Monitor activity through [Atlassian audit logs](https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/monitor-atlassian-rovo-mcp-server-activity/)\n- Configure IP allowlisting for additional security\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> MCP clients can perform actions in Jira, Confluence, and Compass with your existing permissions. Use least privilege, review high-impact changes before confirming, and monitor audit logs for unusual activity.
