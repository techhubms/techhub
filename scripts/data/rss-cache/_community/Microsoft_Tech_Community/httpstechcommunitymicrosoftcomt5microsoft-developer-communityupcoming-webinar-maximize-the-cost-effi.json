  "EnhancedContent": "## Join this webinar to get practical guidance on building and scaling AI agents on Azure with financial discipline in mind.\n\nAI agents are quickly becoming central to how organizations automate work, engage customers, and unlock new insights. But ***as adoption accelerates, so do questions about cost, ROI, and long-term sustainability***. That’s exactly what the Maximize the Cost Efficiency of AI Agents on Azure webinar is designed to address.\n\n***The webinar will provide practical guidance on building and scaling AI agents on Azure with financial discipline in mind***. Rather than focusing only on technology, the session helps learners connect AI design decisions to real business outcomes—covering everything from identifying high-impact use cases and understanding cost drivers to forecasting ROI.\n\nWhether you’re just starting your AI journey or expanding AI agents across the enterprise, the session will equip you with strategies to make informed, cost-conscious decisions at every stage—from architecture and model selection to ongoing optimization and governance.\n\n**Who should attend?**\n\nIf you are in one of these roles and are a decision maker or can influence decision makers in AI decisions or need to show ROI metrics on AI, this session is for you.\n\n- Developer\n- Administrator\n- Solution Architect\n- AI Engineer\n- Business Analyst\n- Business User\n- Technology Manager\n\n**Why attending the webinar?**\n\nIn the webinar, you’ll hear how to translate theory into real-world scenarios, walk through common cost pitfalls, and show how organizations are applying these principles in practice.\n\nMost importantly, the webinar helps you connect the dots faster, turning what you’ve learned into actionable insights you can apply immediately, ask questions live, and gain clarity on how to maximize ROI while scaling AI responsibly.\n\nIf you care about building AI agents that are not only innovative but also efficient, governable, and financially sustainable, [this training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/maximize-cost-efficiency-ai-agents/)—and this webinar that complements it—are well worth your time.\n\n[Register for the free webinar today](https://developer.microsoft.com/reactor/events/26742/?wt.mc_id=blog1_26742_webpage_reactor) for the event on **March 5, 2026, 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM (UTC-08:00) Pacific Time (US & Canada).**\n\n**Who will speak at the webinar?**\n\nYour speakers will be:\n\n*Carlotta Castelluccio*: Carlotta is a Senior AI Advocate with the mission of helping every developer to succeed with AI, by building innovative solutions responsibly.
