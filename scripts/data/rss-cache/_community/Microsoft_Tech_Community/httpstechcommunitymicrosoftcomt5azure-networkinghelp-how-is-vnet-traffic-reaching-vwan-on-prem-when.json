  "Title": "Help! - How is VNet traffic reaching vWAN/on‑prem when the VNet isn’t connected to the vWAN hub",
  "FeedLevelAuthor": "rss.livelink.threads-in-node",
  "Description": "![]() Hello,\n\nI needed some clarity on how the following is working:\n\nAttached is a network diagram of our current setup. The **function apps** (in VNet-1) initiate a connection(s) to a specific **IP:Port** or **FQDN:Port** in the on-premises network(s). A **Private DNS zone** ensures that any FQDN is resolved to the correct internal IP address of the on-prem endpoint. In our setup, both the **function app** and the **external firewall** reside in the **same VNet. T**his firewall is described as “Unattached” because it is not the built-in firewall of a secured vWAN hub, but rather an independent Azure Firewall deployed in that VNet. **** The VNet has a user-defined **default route (0.0.0.0/0)** directing **all outbound traffic to the firewall’s IP**. The firewall then **filters the traffic**, allowing only traffic destined to whitelisted on-premises IP: Port or FQDN: Port combinations (using *IP Groups*), and blocking everything else.\n\nThe critical question and the part that I am unable to figure out is: **Once the firewall permits a packet, how does Azure know to route it to the vWAN hub and on to the site-to-site VPN?**\n\n*Because VNet-1* truly has **no connection at all to the vWAN hub** (no direct attachment, no peering, no VPN from the NVA). But the traffic is still reaching the on-prem sites. Unable to figure out how this is happening. Am I missing something obvious?\n\nAny help on this would be appreciated.\n\nThank you!",
