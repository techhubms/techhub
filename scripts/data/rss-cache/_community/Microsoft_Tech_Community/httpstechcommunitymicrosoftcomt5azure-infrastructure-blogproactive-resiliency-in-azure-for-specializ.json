  "EnhancedContent": "## How to approach Multi-Region Design for your Mission Critical Workloads\n\nIn this post, I’ll share my perspective on designing cloud architectures for near-zero downtime. We’ll explore how adopting multi-region strategies and other best practices can dramatically improve reliability. The discussion will be technically and architecturally driven covering key decisions around network architecture, data replication, user experience continuity, and cost management but also touch on the business angle of why this matters.\n\nThe goal is to inform and inspire you to strengthen your own systems, and guide you toward concrete actions such as engaging with Microsoft Cloud Solution Architects (CSAs), submitting workloads for resiliency reviews, and embracing multi-region design patterns.\n\n### **Resilience as a Shared Responsibility**\n\nOne fundamental truth in cloud architecture is that ensuring uptime is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and you, the customer. Microsoft is responsible for the reliability of the cloud in other words, we build and operate Azure’s core infrastructure to be highly available.\n\nThis includes the physical datacenters, network backbone, power/cooling, and built-in platform features for redundancy. We also provide a rich toolkit of resiliency features (think availability sets, Availability Zones, geo-redundant storage, service failover capabilities, backup services, etc.) that you can leverage to increase the reliability of your workloads.\n\nHowever, the reliability in the cloud of your specific applications and data is up to you. You control your application architecture, deployment topology, data replication, and failover strategies. **If you run everything in a single region with no backups or fallbacks, even Azure’s rock-solid foundation can’t save you from an outage**. On the other hand, if you architect smartly (using multiple regions, zones, and Azure resiliency features properly), you can achieve end-to-end high availability even through major platform incidents.\n\nIn short: Microsoft ensures the cloud itself is resilient, but you must design resilience into your workload. It’s a true partnership one where both sides play a critical role in delivering robust, continuous services to end-users. I emphasize this because it sets the mindset: proactive resiliency is something we do with our customers. As you’ll see, Microsoft has programs and people (like CSAs) dedicated to helping you succeed in this shared model.\n\n#### Six Layers of Resilient Cloud Architecture for Citrix VDI workloads\n\nTo systematically approach multi-region resiliency, it helps to break the problem down into layers. In my work, I arrived at a six-layer decision framework for designing resilient architectures. This was originally developed for a global Citrix DaaS deployment on Azure (hence some VDI flavor in the examples), but the principles apply broadly to cloud solutions. The layers ensure we cover everything from the ground-up network connectivity to the operational model for failover.\n\n#### 1. Network Fabric (the global backbone)\n\nEstablish high-performance, low-latency links between regions.\n\nPreferred: Use Global VNet Peering for simplified any-to-any connectivity with minimal latency over Microsoft’s backbone (ideal for point-to-point replication traffic), rather than a more complex Azure Virtual WAN unless your topology demands it.\n\n#### 2. Storage Foundation (the bedrock )\n\nIn any distributed computing environment, storage is the \"heaviest\" component. Moving compute (VDAs) is instantaneous; moving data (profiles, user layers) is governed by bandwidth and the speed of light. The success of a multi-region DaaS deployment hinges on the performance and synchronization of the underlying storage subsystem.\n\nUse storage that can handle cross-region workload needs, especially for user data or state. In case of Citrix Daas, preferred approach is Azure NetApp Files (ANF) for consistent sub-millisecond latency and high throughput. ANF provides enterprise-grade performance (critical during “login storms” or peak I/O) and features like Cool Access tiering to optimize cost, outperforming standard Azure Files for this scenario.\n\n#### 3. User Profile & State (solving data gravity)\n\nEnable active-active availability of user data or application state across regions.\n\nSolution: FSLogix Cloud Cache (in a VDI context) or similar distributed caching/replication tech, which allows simultaneous read/write of profile data in multiple regions. In our case, Cloud Cache insulates the user session from WAN latency by writing to a local cache and asynchronously replicating to the secondary region, overcoming the challenge of traditional file locking. The principle extends to databases or state stores: use geo-replication or distributed databases to avoid any single-region state.\n\n#### 4. Access & Ingress (the intelligent front door)\n\nEnsure users/customers connect to the right region and can fail over seamlessly. Preferred: Deploy a global traffic management solution under your control e.g. customer-managed NetScaler (Citrix ADC) with Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to direct users to the nearest available datacenter. In our design, NetScaler’s GSLB uses DNS-based geo-routing and supports Local Host Cache for Citrix, meaning even if the cloud control plane (Citrix Cloud) is unreachable, users can still connect to their desktop apps. The general point: use Azure Front Door, Traffic Manager, or third-party equivalents to steer traffic, and avoid any solution that introduces a new single point of failure in the authentication or gateway path.\n\n#### 5. Master Image (ensuring global consistency) :\n\nIf you rely on VM images or similar artifacts, replicate them globally. Use: Azure Compute Gallery\n\n(ACG) to manage and distribute images across regions. In our case, we maintain a single “golden” image for virtual desktops: it’s built once, then the Compute Gallery replicates it from West Europe to East US (and any other region) automatically. This ensures that when we scale out or recover in Region B, we’re launching the exact same app versions and OS as Region A. Consistency here prevents failover from causing functionality regressions.\n\n#### 6. Operations & Cost (smart economics at scale)\n\nRun an efficient DR strategy you want readiness without paying 2x all the time.\n\nApproach: Warm Standby with autoscaling. That means the secondary region isn’t serving full traffic during normal operations (some resources can be scaled down or even deallocated), but it can scale up rapidly when needed.\n\nFor our scenario, we leverage Citrix Autoscale to keep the DR site in a minimal state only a small buffer of machines is powered on, just enough to handle a sudden failover until load-based scaling brings up the rest. This “active/passive” model (or hot-warm rather than hot-hot) strikes a balance: you pay only for what you use, yet you can meet your RTO (Recovery Time Objective) because resources spin up automatically on trigger. In cloud-native terms, you might use Azure Automation or scale sets to similar effect. The key is to avoid having an idle full duplicate environment incurring full costs 24/7, while still being prepared.\n\nEach of these layers corresponds to critical architectural choices that determine your overall resiliency. Neglect any one layer, and that’s where Murphy’s Law will strike next. For example, you might perfectly replicate your data across regions, but if you forgot about network connectivity, a regional hub outage could still cut off access. Or you have every system duplicated, but if users can’t be rerouted to the backup region in time, the benefit is lost. The six-layer framework helps make sure we cover all bases.\n\nNotably, these design best practices align very closely with Azure’s Well-Architected Framework (especially the Reliability pillar), and they’re exactly the kind of prescriptive guidance we provide through programs like the Proactive Resiliency Initiative. In fact, the PRI playbook essentially prioritizes these same steps for customers:\n\nFirst, harden the network foundation e.g. ensure ExpressRoute gateways are zone-redundant and circuits are “multi-homed” in at least two locations (so no single datacenter failure breaks connectivity).\n\nNext, address in-region resiliency – make sure critical workloads are distributed across Availability Zones and not vulnerable to a single zone outage. (As an aside: Microsoft’s internal data shows a huge payoff here; when we configured our top Azure services for zonal resilience, we saw a 68% reduction in platform outages that lead to support incidents!)\n\nThen, enable multi-region continuity (BCDR) – for those tier-0 and tier-1 workloads, set up cross-regional failover so even a region-wide disruption won’t take you down. Multi-region is described as the complement to (not a substitute for) zonal design: it’s about surviving the “black swan” of a region-level event, and also about supporting geo-distributed users and future growth.\n\nIn other words, if you follow the six-layer approach, you’re doing exactly what our structured resiliency programs recommend.\n\nUpdated Feb 06, 2026\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure hardware infrastructure](/tag/azure%20hardware%20infrastructure?nodeId=board%3AAzureInfrastructureBlog)\n\n[azure virtual machines](/tag/azure%20virtual%20machines?nodeId=board%3AAzureInfrastructureBlog)\n\n[cloud security best practices](/tag/cloud%20security%20best%20practices?nodeId=board%3AAzureInfrastructureBlog)\n\n[platform security](/tag/platform%20security?nodeId=board%3AAzureInfrastructureBlog)\n\n[!\\[ravisha&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS00MzYyODItNTU3MTA3aTY0NUQ2QUFFNTUwQ0Q2MTE?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/ravisha/436282) [ravisha](/users/ravisha/436282) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined October 30, 2019\n\n[View Profile](/users/ravisha/436282)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azureinfrastructureblog [Azure Infrastructure Blog](/category/azure/blog/azureinfrastructureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
