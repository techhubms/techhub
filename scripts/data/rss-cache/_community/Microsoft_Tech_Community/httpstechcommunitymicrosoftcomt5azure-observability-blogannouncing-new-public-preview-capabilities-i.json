  "Description": "[Azure Monitor pipeline](https://aka.ms/AzMonEdgePipeline), similar to ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, enhances traditional data collection methods. It streamlines data collection from various sources through a unified ingestion pipeline and utilizes a standardized configuration approach that is more efficient and scalable.\n\nAs Azure Monitor pipeline is used in **more complex and security‑sensitive environments** — including on‑premises infrastructure, edge locations, and large Kubernetes clusters — certain patterns and challenges show up consistently.\n\nBased on what we’ve been seeing across these deployments, we’re sharing a few new capabilities now available in **public preview**. These updates focus on three areas that tend to matter most at scale: **secure ingestion**, **control over where pipeline instances run**, and **processing data before it lands in Azure Monitor**.\n\nHere’s what’s new — and why it matters.\n\n- Secure ingestion with TLS and mutual TLS (mTLS)\n- Pod placement controls for Azure Monitor pipeline\n- Transformations and Automated Schema Standardization\n\n## Secure ingestion with TLS and mutual TLS (mTLS)\n\n##### Why is this needed?\n\nAs telemetry ingestion moves beyond Azure and closer to the edge, **security expectations increase**.
