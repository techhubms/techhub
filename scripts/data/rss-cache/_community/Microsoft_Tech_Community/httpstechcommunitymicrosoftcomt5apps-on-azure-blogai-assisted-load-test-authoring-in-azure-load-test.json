  "Description": "Creating reliable load tests shouldn’t require hours of manual scripting. With AI-assisted load test authoring in Azure Load Testing, you can go from a simple browser recording to a production-ready JMeter script in minutes, while staying fully in control of what gets applied.\n\nThis new experience helps you:\n\n- Create load tests faster by recording real user journeys directly from the browser\n- Improve script quality automatically with AI-recommended best practices\n- Run more realistic tests that better reflect real user behavior\n- Reduce manual effort without giving up transparency or control\n\n**Record once. Let AI enhance the script.**\n\nUsing the [**Azure App Testing browser extension**](https://aka.ms/AppTesting/Browser-Ext) for Edge and Chrome, you can record how users interact with your application. Once uploaded to Azure Load Testing, AI analyzes the recording and suggests improvements you can review and apply with a click.\n\nAI helps by:\n\n- Adding **smart labels** so scripts and test results are easier to understand\n- Applying **think times** based on actual user interactions\n- Suggesting **correlations** for dynamic values to prevent test failures at scale\n- Identifying **parameterization opportunities** to simulate diverse users and data\n\nYou can accept, edit, or skip recommendations and still manually fine-tune the script if needed.\n\n![]()\n\n**Run at scale with confidence**\n\nOnce your script is ready, configure load, ramp-up, and duration, and run the test at scale using **Azure Load Testing**. A JMeter script is generated automatically and can be downloaded for further customization.\n\nThe result is faster test creation, higher-quality scripts, and more meaningful performance insights.\n\n**Get started**\n\nAI-assisted load test authoring is available today in Azure Load Testing. Install the Azure App Testing browser extension, record a user journey, and create realistic load tests with less effort and better results. Learn more about the feature [here](https://aka.ms/AppTesting/AIAuthoring).\n\nTell us what’s working and what we can improve on [developer community](https://aka.ms/malt-feedback) or directly from the in-product feedback option. Your feedback helps shape the future of AI-assisted load testing.\n\nHappy Load Testing!",
