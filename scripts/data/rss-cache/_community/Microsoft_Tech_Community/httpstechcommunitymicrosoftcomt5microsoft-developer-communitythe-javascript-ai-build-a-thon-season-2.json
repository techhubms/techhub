  "EnhancedContent": "Most applications used by millions of people every single day are powered by JavaScript/TypeScript. But when it comes to AI, most learning resources and code samples assume you're working in Python and will leave you trying to stitch scattered tutorials together to build AI into your stack.\n\nThe **JavaScript AI Build-a-thon** is a free, hands-on program designed to close that gap. Over the course of four weeks **(March 2 - March 31, 2026)**, you'll move from running AI 100% on-device (Local AI), to designing multi-service, multi-agentic systems, all in JavaScript/ TypeScript and using tools you are already familiar with. The series will culminate in a **hackathon**, where you will create, compete and turn what you'll have learnt into working projects you can point to, talk about and extend.\n\n**Register now at [aka.ms/JSAIBuildathon](https://aka.ms/JSAIBuildathon)**\n\n### How the program works!\n\nThe program is organized around 2 phases: -\n\n#### Phase I: Learn & Skill Up Schedule (Mar 2 - 13)\n\n- Self-paced quests that teach core AI patterns,\n- Interactive Expert-led sessions on Microsoft Reactor (Livestreams) and Discord (Office hours & QnA)\n\nJavaScript AI Build-a-thon\n\n| Day/Time (PT) | Topic | Links to join | | --- | --- | --- | | Mon 3/2, 8:00 AM PST | Local AI Development with Foundry Local | [Livestream](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26772/)<br>[Discord Office Hour](https://discord.gg/microsoftfoundry?event=1465380906842853666) | | Wed 3/4, 8:00 AM PST | End-to-End Model Development on Microsoft Foundry | [Livestream](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26773/)<br>[Discord Office Hour](https://discord.gg/microsoftfoundry?event=1470927803888173109) | | Fri 3/6, 9:00 AM PST | Advanced RAG Deep Dive + Guided Project | [Livestream](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26775)<br>[Discord Office Hour](https://discord.gg/microsoftfoundry?event=1465381686362509323) | | Mon 3/9, 8:00 AM PST | Design & Build an Agent E2E with Agent Builder (AITK) | [Livestream](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26776/)<br>[Discord Office Hour](https://discord.gg/microsoftfoundry?event=1465382167894036481) | | Wed 3/11, 8:00 AM PST | Build, Scale & Govern AI Agents + Guided project | [Livestream](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26786/)<br>[Discord Office Hour](https://discord.gg/microsoftfoundry?event=1465382908687814840) |\n\nThe Build-a-thon prioritizes practical learning, so you'll complete **2 guided projects** by the end of this phase:-\n\n1. 1. **A Local Serverless AI chat with RAG**\nConcepts covered include: -\n\n- - - RAG Architecture\n- RAG Ingestion pipeline\n- Query & Retrieval\n- Response Generation (LLM Chains)\n\nServerless Chat LangChain.js CodeTour\n\n**2.
