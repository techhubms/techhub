These updates improve long-term support, performance, and compatibility with modern Java platforms, but the migration can surface breaking API changes and dependency mismatches. GitHub Copilot app modernization helps streamline this transition by analyzing your project, generating an upgrade plan, and applying targeted updates.\n\n## Supported Upgrade Path\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization supports upgrading Spring Boot applications to Spring Boot 3.5, including:\n\n- Updating Spring Framework libraries to 6.x\n- Migrating from javax to jakarta\n- Aligning dependency versions with Boot 3.x\n- Updating plugins and starter configurations\n- Adjusting build files for the required JDK level\n- Validating dependency updates and surfacing CVE issues\n\nThese capabilities complement the Microsoft Learn quickstart for upgrading Java projects using GitHub Copilot app modernization.\n\n## How GitHub Copilot app modernization helps\n\nWhen you open a Spring Boot 2.x project in Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA and initiate an upgrade, GitHub Copilot app modernization performs:\n\n### Project Analysis\n\n- Detects your current Spring Boot version\n- Identifies incompatible starters, libraries, and plugins\n- Flags javax.\\* imports requiring Jakarta migration\n- Evaluates your build configuration and JDK requirements\n\n### Upgrade Plan Generation\n\nThe tool produces an actionable plan that outlines:\n\n- New Spring Boot parent version\n- Updated Spring Framework and related modules\n- Required namespace changes from javax.\\* to jakarta.\\*\n- Build plugin updates\n- JDK configuration alignment for Boot 3\n\nYou can review and adjust the plan before applying changes.\n\n### Automated Transformations\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization applies targeted changes such as:\n\n- Updating spring-boot-starter-parent to 3.5.x\n- Migrating imports to jakarta.\\*\n- Updating dependencies and BOM versions\n- Rewriting removed or deprecated APIs\n- Aligning test dependencies (e.g., JUnit 5)\n\n### Build / Fix Iteration\n\nThe agent automatically:\n\n- Builds the project\n- Captures failures\n- Suggests fixes\n- Applies updates\n- Rebuilds until the project compiles successfully\n\nThis loop continues until all actionable issues are addressed.\n\n### Security & Behavior Checks\n\nAs part of the upgrade, the tool can:\n\n- Validate CVEs introduced by dependency version changes\n- Surface potential behavior changes\n- Recommend optional fixes\n\n### Expected Output\n\nAfter running the upgrade for a Spring Boot 2.x project, you should expect:\n\n- An updated Spring Boot parent in Maven or Gradle\n- Spring Framework 6.x and Jakarta-aligned modules\n- Updated starter dependencies and plugin versions\n- Rewritten imports from javax.\\* to jakarta.\\*\n- Updated testing stack\n- A summary file detailing:\n- Versions updated\n- Code edits applied\n- Dependencies changed\n- CVE results\n- Remaining manual review items\n\n## Developer Responsibilities\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization accelerates technical migration tasks, but final validation still requires developer review, including:\n\n- Running the full test suite\n- Reviewing custom filters, security configuration, and web components\n- Re-validating integration points\n- Confirming application behavior across runtime environments\n\nThe tool handles mechanical upgrade work so you can focus on correctness, quality, and functional validation.\n\n## Learn more\n\nFor setup, prerequisites, and the broader Java upgrade workflow, refer to the official Microsoft Learn guide:\n\n[Quickstart: Upgrade a Java Project with GitHub Copilot App Modernization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github-copilot-app-modernization/quickstart-upgrade)\n\nInstall GitHub Copilot app modernization for [VS Code](https://aka.ms/AM014) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://aka.ms/AM015)\n\nUpdated Jan 19, 2026\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n[cloud native](/tag/cloud%20native?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[java](/tag/java?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[java ee](/tag/java%20ee?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[modern apps](/tag/modern%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[serverless](/tag/serverless?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[spring apps](/tag/spring%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[spring integrations](/tag/spring%20integrations?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[ayangupta&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/ayangupta/3334818) [ayangupta](/users/ayangupta/3334818) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined January 13, 2026\n\n[View Profile](/users/ayangupta/3334818)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
