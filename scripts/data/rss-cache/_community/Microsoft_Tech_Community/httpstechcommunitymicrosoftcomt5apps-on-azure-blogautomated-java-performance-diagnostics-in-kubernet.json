  "Description": "Performance issues in Java applications running on Kubernetes can be notoriously hard to diagnose. Traditional approaches often involve manual log analysis, complex tracing, and hours of troubleshooting—time developers would rather spend building features. That’s where the new **Azure Performance Diagnostics Tool for Java**, powered by **Azure SRE Agent**, comes in.\n\n**The key takeaway:** This tool automates Java performance analysis in Kubernetes environments, dramatically reducing the time and effort required to identify and resolve issues. Instead of piecing together fragmented data, developers get actionable insights in minutes, enabling faster root cause detection and improved application reliability.\n\nHere’s why this matters:\n\n- **Automation at Scale** – The tool integrates seamlessly with Azure SRE Agent to collect telemetry and run diagnostics without manual intervention.\n- **Deep JVM Insights** – It provides visibility into thread dumps, heap usage, and garbage collection patterns, helping pinpoint bottlenecks quickly.\n- **Kubernetes-Native** – Designed for containerized workloads, it works in dynamic environments where traditional monitoring falls short.\n\nFor teams managing mission-critical Java apps, this means fewer outages, faster recovery, and more time to innovate. It’s not just a diagnostic tool—it’s a productivity accelerator for modern cloud-native development.\n\nWant to dive deeper into how it works and see real-world examples?
