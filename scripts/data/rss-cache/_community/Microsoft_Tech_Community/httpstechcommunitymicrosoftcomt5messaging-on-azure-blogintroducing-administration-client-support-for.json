This enables dynamic management operations as part of local development and testing.\n\nWe’re excited to announce **** administration client support for the Azure Service Bus emulator, extending the emulator beyond messaging operations to include management capabilities such as creating, updating, and deleting entities locally.\n\nAzure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker that supports reliable messaging through queues and publish‑subscribe topics. Since the introduction of the local emulator, developers have been able to develop and test message flows locally. With this update, the emulator now supports a broader set of workflows that depend on management operations as part of application startup or deployment.\n\n**Why Administration Client support?**\n\nUntil now, the Service Bus emulator supported declarative entity configuration through a configuration file, allowing developers to define entities before starting the emulator. While this worked well for static setups, it limited workflows that require dynamic, runtime entity creation or management.\n\nAdministration Client support unlocks on‑the‑fly entity creation and management, enabling developers to create, update, or delete entities while the emulator is running. This removes the need to restart the emulator for common management operations and brings the local development experience closer to real‑world Azure Service Bus usage.\n\n**How it works**\n\nBy default, the emulator uses port 5300 for management operations. When performing management tasks with the Service Bus Administration Client, be sure to add the port number to the emulator connection string.\n\nDeclarative configuration using the emulator’s configuration file remains supported and continues to serve as **** the source of truth during emulator initialization. Any configuration defined in the file is reapplied when the emulator is initialized and overrides entities created through the Administration Client, making it easy to reset or standardize local environments.\n\nFor the Service Bus emulator, management operations using the Service Bus Administration Client are natively supported in .NET. Language‑specific reference [samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-emulator-installer?tab=readme-ov-file#code-samples)are available to help you get started.\n\n**Getting started**\n\nThe [Azure Service Bus emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/overview-emulator) is available as a [Docker image](https://mcr.microsoft.com/en-us/artifact/mar/azure-messaging/servicebus-emulator/tags) and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can interact with the emulator using the latest Service Bus client SDKs for messaging operations, and use the Service Bus Administration Client to manage entities locally during development and testing.\n\nTo explore administration scenarios, including creating and deleting queues or topics, refer to the Service Bus emulator [reference samples.](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus-emulator-installer/tree/main/Sample-Code-Snippets)\n\nFor more details about the emulator and supported features, visit aka.ms/servicebusemulator\n\n**Share your feedback**\n\nWe appreciate your feedback as we continue to improve the Service Bus emulator.
