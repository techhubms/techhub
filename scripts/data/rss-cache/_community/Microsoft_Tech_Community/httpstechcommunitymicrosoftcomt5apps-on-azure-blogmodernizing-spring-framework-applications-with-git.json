The transition often introduces breaking API changes, updated module requirements, and dependency shifts. GitHub Copilot app modernization streamlines this upgrade by analyzing your project, generating targeted changes, and guiding you through the migration.\n\n## Supported Upgrade Path\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization supports:\n\n- Upgrading Spring Framework to 6.x, including 6.2+\n- Migrating from javax to jakarta\n- Aligning transitive dependencies and version constraints\n- Updating build plugins and configurations\n- Identifying deprecated or removed APIs\n- Validating dependency updates and surfacing CVE issues\n\nThese capabilities align with the Microsoft Learn quickstart for upgrading Java projects with GitHub Copilot app modernization.\n\n## Project Setup\n\nOpen your Spring Framework project in Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA with GitHub Copilot app modernization enabled. The tool works with Maven or Gradle projects and evaluates your existing Spring Framework, Java version, imports, and build configurations.\n\n## Project Analysis\n\nWhen you trigger the upgrade, GitHub Copilot app modernization:\n\n- Detects the current Spring Framework version\n- Flags javax imports requiring Jakarta migration\n- Identifies incompatible modules, libraries, and plugins\n- Validates JDK compatibility requirements for Spring Framework 6.x\n- Reviews transitive dependencies impacted by the update\n\nThis analysis provides the foundation for the upgrade plan generated next.\n\n## Upgrade Plan Generation\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization produces a structured plan including:\n\n- Updated Spring Framework version (6.x / 6.2+)\n- Replacements for deprecated or removed APIs\n- jakarta namespace updates\n- Updated build plugins and version constraints\n- JDK configuration adjustments\n\nYou can review the plan, modify version targets, and confirm actions before the tool applies them.\n\n## Automated Transformations\n\nAfter approval, GitHub Copilot app modernization applies automated changes such as:\n\n- Updating Spring Framework module coordinates\n- Rewriting imports from javax.\\* to jakarta.\\*\n- Updating libraries required for Spring Framework 6.x\n- Adjusting plugin versions and build logic\n- Recommending fixes for API changes\n\nThese transformations rely on OpenRewrite‑based rules to modernize your codebase efficiently.\n\n## Build Fix Iteration\n\nOnce changes are applied, the tool compiles your project and automatically responds to failures:\n\n- Captures compilation errors\n- Suggests targeted fixes\n- Rebuilds iteratively\n\nThis loop continues until the project compiles with Spring Framework 6.x in place.\n\n## Security & Behavior Checks\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization performs validation steps after the upgrade:\n\n- Checks for CVEs in updated dependencies\n- Identifies potential behavior changes introduced during the transition\n- Offers optional fixes to address issues\n\nThis adds confidence before final verification.\n\n## Expected Output\n\nAfter a Spring Framework 5 → 6.x upgrade, you can expect:\n\n- Updated module coordinates for Spring Framework 6.x / 6.2\n- jakarta‑aligned imports across the codebase\n- Updated dependency versions aligned with the new Spring ecosystem\n- Updated plugins and build tool configurations\n- Modernized test stack (JUnit 5)\n- A summary file detailing versions updated, code edits applied, dependencies changed, and items requiring manual review\n\n## Developer Responsibilities\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization accelerates framework upgrade mechanics, but developers remain responsible for:\n\n- Running full test suites\n- Reviewing custom components, filters, and validation logic\n- Revisiting security configurations and reactive vs. servlet designs\n- Checking integration points and application semantics post‑migration\n\nThe tool handles the mechanical modernization work so you can focus on correctness, runtime behavior, and quality assurance.\n\n## Learn More\n\nFor prerequisites, setup steps, and the complete Java upgrade workflow, refer to the Microsoft Learn guide: [Upgrade a Java Project with Github Copilot App Modernization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github-copilot-app-modernization/quickstart-upgrade)\n\nPublished Jan 19, 2026\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[best practices](/tag/best%20practices?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[java](/tag/java?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[java ee](/tag/java%20ee?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[modern apps](/tag/modern%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[updates](/tag/updates?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[ayangupta&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/ayangupta/3334818) [ayangupta](/users/ayangupta/3334818) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined January 13, 2026\n\n[View Profile](/users/ayangupta/3334818)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
