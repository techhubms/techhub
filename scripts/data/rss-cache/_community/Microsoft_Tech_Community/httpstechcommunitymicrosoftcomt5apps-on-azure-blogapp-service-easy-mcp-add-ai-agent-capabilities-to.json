Tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other AI assistants are no longer just answering questions—they're taking actions, calling APIs, and automating complex workflows. But how do you make your existing applications and APIs accessible to these intelligent agents?\n\nAt Microsoft Ignite, I teamed up to present session [BRK116: Apps, agents, and MCP is the AI innovation recipe](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/BRK116?source=sessions), where I demonstrated how you can add agentic capabilities to your existing applications with little to no code changes. Today, I'm excited to share a concrete example of that vision: **Easy MCP**—a way to expose any REST API to AI agents with absolutely zero code changes to your existing apps.\n\n## The Challenge: Bridging REST APIs and AI Agents\n\nMost organizations have invested years building REST APIs that power their applications. These APIs represent critical business logic, data access patterns, and integrations. But AI agents speak a different language—they use protocols like [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to discover and invoke tools.\n\nThe traditional approach would require you to:\n\n1. Learn the MCP SDK\n2. Write new MCP server code\n3. Manually map each API endpoint to an MCP tool\n4. Deploy and maintain additional infrastructure\n\n**What if you could skip all of that?**\n\n## Introducing Easy MCP (a proof of concept not associated with the App Service platform)\n\nEasy MCP is an OpenAPI-to-MCP translation layer that automatically generates MCP tools from your existing REST APIs. If your API has an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification—which most modern APIs do—you can make it accessible to AI agents in minutes. This means that if you have existing apps with OpenAPI specifications already running on App Service, or really any hosting platform, this tool makes enabling MCP seamless.\n\n### How It Works\n\n1. **Point** the gateway at your API's base URL\n2. **Detect** your OpenAPI specification automatically\n3. **Connect** and the gateway generates MCP tools for every endpoint\n4. **Use** the MCP endpoint URL with any MCP-compatible AI client\n\nThat's it. No code changes. No SDK integration. No manual tool definitions.\n\n### See It in Action\n\nLet's say you have a Todo API running on Azure App Service at `https://my-todo-app.azurewebsites.net`. In just a few clicks:\n\n1. Open the Easy MCP web UI\n2. Enter your API URL\n3. Click \"Detect\" to find your OpenAPI spec\n4. Click \"Connect\"\n\nNow configure your AI client (like VS Code with GitHub Copilot) to use the gateway's MCP endpoint:\n\n``` { \"servers\": { \"my-api\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"url\": \"https://my-gateway.azurewebsites.net/mcp\" } } } ```\n\nInstantly, your AI assistant can:\n\n- \"What's on my todo list?\"\n- \"Add 'Review PR #123' to my todos with high priority\"\n- \"Mark all tasks as complete\"\n\nAll powered by your existing REST API, with zero modifications.\n\n## The Bigger Picture: Modernization Without Rewrites\n\nThis approach aligns perfectly with a broader modernization strategy we're enabling on Azure App Service.\n\n### App Service Managed Instance: Move and Modernize Legacy Apps\n\nFor organizations with legacy applications—whether they're running on older Windows frameworks, custom configurations, or traditional hosting environments—[Azure App Service Managed Instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-managed-instance) provides a path to the cloud with minimal friction. You can migrate these applications to a fully managed platform without rewriting code.\n\n### Easy MCP: Add AI Capabilities Post-Migration\n\nOnce your legacy applications are running on App Service, Easy MCP becomes the next step in your modernization journey. That 10-year-old internal API? It can now be accessed by AI agents. That legacy inventory system? AI assistants can query and update it. No code changes needed.\n\n**The modernization path:**\n\n1. **Migrate** legacy apps to App Service with Managed Instance (no code changes)\n2. **Expose** APIs to AI agents with Easy MCP Gateway (no code changes)\n3. **Empower** your organization with AI-assisted workflows\n\n## Deploy It Yourself\n\nEasy MCP is open source and ready to deploy. If you already have an existing API to use with this tool, go for it. If you need an app to test with, check out [this sample](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/tutorial-ai-integrate-azure-ai-agent-dotnet). Make sure you complete the \"Add OpenAPI functionality to your web app\" step. You don't need to go beyond that.\n\n**GitHub Repository:** [seligj95/app-service-easy-mcp](https://github.com/seligj95/app-service-easy-mcp)\n\nDeploy to Azure in minutes with Azure Developer CLI:\n\n``` azd auth login azd init azd up ```\n\nOr run it locally for testing:\n\n``` npm install npm run dev\n# Open http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n## What's Next: Native App Service Integration\n\nHere's where it gets really exciting.\n\nWe're exploring ways to **build this capability directly into the Azure App Service platform so you won't have to deploy a second app or additional resources to get this capability.** [Azure API Management recently released a feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/export-rest-mcp-server) with functionality to expose a REST API, including an API on App Service, as an MCP server, which I highly recommend that you check out if you're familiar with Azure API Management. But in this case, imagine a future where adding AI agent capabilities to your App Service apps is as simple as flipping a switch in the Azure Portal—no gateway or API Management deployment required, no additional infrastructure or services to manage, and built-in security, monitoring, scaling, etc.—all of the features you're already using and are familiar with on App Service.\n\nStay tuned for updates as we continue to make Azure App Service the best platform for AI-powered applications.
