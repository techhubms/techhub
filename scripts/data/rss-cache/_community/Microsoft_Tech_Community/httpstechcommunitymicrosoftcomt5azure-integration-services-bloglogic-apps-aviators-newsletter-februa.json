  "Description": "**In this issue:**\n\n- Ace Aviator of the Month\n- News from our product group\n- News from our community\n\n# Ace Aviator of the Month\n\n**February 2026’s Ace Aviator: [Camilla Bielk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camilla-bielk-0481411/)**\n\n![]()Camilla Bielk - Solutions Architect @ XLENT\n\n##### What's your role and title? What are your responsibilities?\n\nI’m a developer and solution architect, working as a consultant (at XLENT) in teams involved across the integration lifecycle—from understanding business needs and building new solutions to operations. Previously I worked a lot with BizTalk and with customers using both Azure and BizTalk. In my current role, I work exclusively with Azure.\n\n##### Can you give us some insights into your day-to-day activities and what a typical day in your role looks like?\n\nA typical day starts by syncing operational status with the team to ensure everything is running as expected (Logic Apps, Service Bus, Functions, API Management, etc.) and discussing any findings from the previous day. Then I continue with ongoing work, ranging from stakeholder meetings and designing new integration flows to C# development, operations, and maintenance of the existing landscape.\n\nI enjoy being involved across the entire chain. Working closely with operational issues provides valuable input into design decisions, and vice versa, which strengthens me as a designer and architect.\n\n##### What motivates and inspires you to be an active member of the Aviators/Microsoft community?\n\nThe openness to feedback and knowledge sharing from both community developers and the product team motivates me to stay active, continuously learn, and become the best consultant I can be. Passing knowledge to new team members is rewarding and completes the circle. Integration conferences are inspiring - networking with amazing people and discussing the technology we use every day. That’s also why we started the Nordic Integration Summit: to give more people the chance to take part in such an inspiring event.\n\n##### Looking back, what advice do you wish you had been given earlier that you'd now share with those looking to get into STEM/technology?\n\nYour social skills are more valuable than you might think. Teamwork is everything, and understanding business needs—even from non-technical colleagues—is just as important as technology. Listen to your heart and find environments where you can thrive.\n\nProgramming languages change over time; the real takeaway is mastering common concepts and patterns and developing the ability to learn continuously. Stay curious and embrace new things as they come!\n\n##### What has helped you grow professionally?\n\n100% of my professional growth comes from working with kind, humble, and collaborative people—teams where knowledge is shared freely in all directions, mistakes are allowed, and learning from them is encouraged.\n\n##### If you had a magic wand that could create a feature in Logic Apps, what would it be and why?\n\nBetter cost transparency—clearly showing which actions drive costs (executions, retries, data volume, logging) with visibility before production deployment. Design-time guidance that warns about expensive operations, anti-patterns, and inefficient configurations.\n\n# News from our product group\n\n| ![]() | [Introducing Unit Test Agent Profiles for Logic Apps & Data Maps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/introducing-unit-test-agent-profiles-for-logic-apps--data-maps/4490216)<br><br><br>Focused unit test agent profiles help Logic Apps Standard teams discover workflows and data maps, write reusable specifications, generate typed mocks/test data, and implement MSTest suites against the Automated Test SDK. The approach promotes spec-first testing, consistent artifacts, and reliable validations across scenarios (happy path, error handling, boundaries). The project demonstrates how GitHub Copilot custom agents and prompts can accelerate unit test authoring while enforcing constraints for maintainability in enterprise integrations. | | --- | --- | | ![]() | [Automated Test Framework - Missing Tests in Test Explorer](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/automated-test-framework---missing-tests-in-test-explorer/4490186)<br><br><br>If Logic Apps Standard tests disappear from VS Code’s Test Explorer, the cause is typically a MSTest version mismatch introduced by a recent C# DevKit update. The fix is to update package references in the project (MSTest, Test SDK, and related dependencies) to supported versions. After adjusting packages and restarting VS Code, tests reappear and run as expected. The extension is being updated, but existing projects should apply the manual changes to restore a stable testing experience. | | ![]() | [Upcoming Agentic Azure Logic Apps Workshops](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/upcoming-agentic-azure-logic-apps-workshops/4484526)<br><br><br>Free workshops introduce Agentic Business Processes in Azure Logic Apps, including MCP Server integrations and agent loop patterns. Sessions cover connecting the enterprise with MCP Servers from Copilot Studio and building agentic workflows in a day using Logic Apps (Standard). Registration links are provided, with dates set in January. These events help practitioners explore agent tools, orchestration patterns, and practical scenarios for intelligent automation in modern integration landscapes. |\n\n# News from our community\n\n##### [Enterprise AI ≠ Copilot](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/enterprise-ai-copilot-al-ghoniem-mba-cr87c?trk=public_post-text)\n\nPost by [*Al Ghoneim*](https://au.linkedin.com/in/alghoniem?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\nWhy rolling out Copilot is not an AI strategy. Copilot, centered on Microsoft 365 experiences, is a finished SaaS product intended to boost individual productivity within bounded contexts like Word, Teams, and Excel. Even as agentic features expand via Copilot Studio and workflow orchestration, it remains fundamentally assistive with platform guardrails. Enterprise AI targets broader, end‑to‑end outcomes and agentic capabilities, shifting from assistive tooling to systems that can coordinate tasks, reasoning, and integration across domains.\n\n##### [BizTalk Server and WinSCP Error: Could not load file or assembly ‘WinSCPnet](https://blog.sandro-pereira.com/2026/01/27/biztalk-server-and-winscp-error-could-not-load-file-or-assembly-winscpnet-version1-16-0-16453-cultureneutral-publickeytoken2271ec4a3c56d0bf-or-one-of-its-dependencies/)\n\nPost by [*Sandro Pereira*](https://pt.linkedin.com/in/sandropereira?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\nConfiguring SFTP in BizTalk Server can fail in unexpected ways after routine updates. This article explores a recurring but often misunderstood issue where BizTalk Server deployments break due to WinSCP version mismatches introduced by cumulative updates. Rather than focusing on a single error, it highlights the broader challenge of managing external dependencies across BizTalk versions and update levels. The post walks through why this problem keeps resurfacing and what teams should be aware of when maintaining or upgrading BizTalk environments. A useful read for anyone responsible for keeping BizTalk Server integrations stable and predictable over time.\n\n##### [More on finding application registrations used by Logic Apps](https://www.mikaelsand.se/2026/01/more-on-finding-application-registrations-used-by-logic-apps/)\n\nPost by [*Mikael Sand*](https://se.linkedin.com/in/mikaelsand?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\nTracking down where application registrations are actually used in Azure can be harder than it should be—especially when Logic Apps authenticate through custom HTTP actions. If you’ve ever wondered how many workflows still rely on a specific client ID or secret, or struggled to assess the real blast radius of a credential change, this post tackles that blind spot. It explores how Azure Resource Graph can surface hidden dependencies that don’t show up in connector views, helping you answer a deceptively simple question: where is this app registration really being used?\n\n##### [MCP Servers in Azure Logic Apps Agent Loops (Step-by-Step)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jinbjN2PfJA)\n\nVideo by [*Stephen W. Thomas*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-w-thomas?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\nUnlock the full power of your AI agents by moving tool logic out of Logic App Agent loops and into reusable Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers. In this video, Stephen demonstrates a new capability in Azure Logic App Agent Loops that lets you call both built-in Microsoft MCP servers and your own custom MCP servers. Previously, you had to define tools and actions directly inside the agent loop. Now, you can abstract that logic into standalone Logic Apps exposed as MCP servers, enabling better reusability across your enterprise.\n\n##### [From Rigid Choreography to Intelligent Collaboration: Agentic Orchestration as the Evolution of SOA](https://sjwiggers.com/2026/01/25/from-rigid-choreography-to-intelligent-collaboration-agentic-orchestration-as-the-evolution-of-soa/)\n\nPost by [*Steef‑Jan Wiggers*](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/steefjan?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\nFor years, integration has relied on carefully scripted flows—precise, reliable, and increasingly brittle. A new shift is emerging that challenges this model, blending the discipline of SOA with systems that can reason, adapt, and collaborate. Instead of hard‑coded sequences, orchestration starts to look more like goal‑driven problem solving. What does this mean for architects shaped by BizTalk, BPEL, and classic enterprise integration patterns? And how does it change the role of platforms like Azure Logic Apps? This piece explores why “agentic orchestration” is resonating now, what it unlocks for real-world integration scenarios, and why it may feel less like a disruption—and more like a long‑overdue evolution.\n\n##### [“Run with payload” in the new Logic Apps designer enforces JSON only](https://blog.sandro-pereira.com/2026/01/23/run-with-payload-logic-apps-designer-enforces-json/)\n\nPost by [*Sandro Pereira*](https://pt.linkedin.com/in/sandropereira?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\nManual testing just got trickier in the new Azure Logic Apps designer. A subtle design choice is changing how developers validate workflows that don’t speak JSON—and it’s easy to miss until it blocks your flow. If you rely on XML or other non‑JSON payloads, the authoring experience may not behave the way runtime does, creating a surprising gap between design-time testing and real execution. This post explores where that gap shows up, why it matters for integration-heavy scenarios, and what it reveals about the current state of the new designer. Worth a read if payload formats are part of your everyday Logic Apps work.\n\n##### [MCP Servers in Azure Logic Apps Agent Loops (Step-by-Step)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jinbjN2PfJA)\n\nPost by [*Stephen W. Thomas*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-w-thomas?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\nWhat does it really take to get a useful AI agent running in Azure—without heavy setup or long-term commitment? This article explores a pragmatic path using Logic Apps Consumption and Agent Loop to build a stateful, tool‑orchestrating agent with minimal infrastructure. It highlights why pay‑as‑you‑go agents can be ideal for experimentation, demos, and low‑volume workloads, and what tradeoffs come with that simplicity. If you’re curious how far you can push agentic patterns in Logic Apps before moving to more advanced hosting models, this is a concrete, experience‑driven walkthrough worth a closer look.",
