Over the past year, we have worked closely with Oracle to rapidly expand the global footprint of Oracle Database@Azure, bringing Oracle AI Database services to more than 30 Azure regions worldwide.\n\nWe are excited to announce that Oracle Database@Azure is now available in the West Europe (Netherlands) region. This expansion allows customers across Europe to deploy AI and data‑intensive workloads closer to their users while meeting stringent regulatory and compliance standards.\n\nIn addition, Oracle Database@Azure is now live in Brazil Southeast (Rio de Janeiro), enhancing regional disaster recovery and business continuity capabilities. This new region complements the existing Brazil South (São Paulo) region, providing customers with greater resilience and flexibility across geographies.\n\nWith this announcement, Oracle Database@Azure is available in the following Azure regions: Canada Central, Canada East, Central US, East US, East US2, North Central US, South Central US, West US, West US 2, West US 3, UK South, UK West, France Central, France South, Germany North, Germany West Central, North Europe, Italy North, West Europe, Spain Central, Sweden Central, Switzerland North, United Arab Emirates Central, United Arab Emirates North, Australia East, Australia Southeast, Central India, South India, Japan East, Japan West, Southeast Asia, Brazil South, and Brazil Southeast.\n\n## Seamless migration to Oracle Database@Azure—without re‑architecting\n\nWith Oracle Database@Azure, Microsoft and Oracle deliver a unified, AI-ready data platform that brings applications and data together in a single, tightly integrated cloud environment. Oracle Database services—including Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Base Database Service, and Oracle Exadata Database Service (Exascale and Dedicated)—run on Oracle Exadata infrastructure deployed directly inside Azure datacenters, providing ultra-low latency, high throughput, and predictable performance for Azure-based applications.\n\nCustomers can migrate and modernize with confidence while preserving full licensing flexibility, continuing to use existing Oracle licenses through Bring Your Own License (BYOL) or choosing a license-included option. Databases can move to Azure quickly without code changes or re-architecting, using Oracle Zero Downtime Migration to automate migrations and minimize risk and disruption. For mission-critical workloads, customers can deploy Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) Silver and Gold reference architectures on Azure, combining Oracle database resilience with Azure Availability Zones and global infrastructure.\n\nWith databases and applications colocated in the cloud, customers eliminate the cost, complexity, and performance impact of cross-environment data movement—creating an ideal foundation for AI-driven analytics, real-time insights, and intelligent applications. This close integration makes it easy to pair Oracle databases with Azure’s AI and data services, including Microsoft Fabric, Copilot Studio, and Azure App Service, while keeping mission-critical data securely governed within Oracle Database.\n\nThe result is a native Azure experience for identity, networking, security, observability, and billing—managed through Microsoft Entra ID, Azure networking, Azure Monitor, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud—delivering a simpler architecture, faster time to value, and a more efficient path to AI adoption.\n\n## Ready to get started?\n\nWe look forward to continuing to expand Oracle Database@Azure across more regions and delivering the capabilities customers need to unlock the full potential of their Oracle data.\n\nWe invite you to our upcoming [Oracle AI World Tour events](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/oracleonazureblog/microsoft-hits-the-road-with-oracle-ai-world-tour-2026-/4477598) to learn more about the exciting growth of Oracle Database@Azure.
