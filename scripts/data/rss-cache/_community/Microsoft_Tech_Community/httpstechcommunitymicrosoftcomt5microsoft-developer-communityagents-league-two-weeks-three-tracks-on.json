  "Description": "We're inviting all developers to join **Agents League**, running February 16-27. It's a two-week challenge where you'll build AI agents using production-ready tools, learn from live coding sessions, and get feedback directly from Microsoft product teams.\n\nWe've put together starter kits for each track to help you get up and running quickly that also includes requirements and guidelines. Whether you want to explore what GitHub Copilot can do beyond autocomplete, build reasoning agents on Microsoft Foundry, or create enterprise integrations for Microsoft 365 Copilot, we have a track for you.\n\n> >\n> **Important:** [Register first](https://aka.ms/agentsleague/register) to be eligible for prizes and your digital badge. Without registration, you won't qualify for awards or receive a badge when you submit.\n> >\n\n## What Is Agents League?\n\nIt's a 2-week competition that combines learning with building:\n\n- **📽️ Live coding battles** – Watch Product teams, MVPs and community members tackle challenges in real-time on Microsoft Reactor\n- **💻 Async challenges** – Build at your own pace, on your schedule\n- **💬 Discord community** – Connect with other participants, join AMAs, and get help when you need it\n- **🏆 Prizes** – $500 per track winner, plus GitHub Copilot Pro subscriptions for top picks\n\n### The Three Tracks\n\n- **🎨 Creative Apps** — Build with GitHub Copilot (Chat, CLI, or SDK)\n- **🧠 Reasoning Agents** — Build with Microsoft Foundry\n- **💼 Enterprise Agents** — Build with M365 Agents Toolkit (or Copilot Studio)\n\nMore details on each track below, or jump straight to the [starter kits](https://github.com/microsoft/agentsleague/tree/main/starter-kits).\n\n## The Schedule\n\nAgents League starts on February 16th and runs through Feburary 27th. Within 2 weeks, we host live battles on Reactor and AMA sessions on Discord.\n\n### Week 1: Live Battles (Feb 17-19)\n\nWe're kicking off with live coding battles streamed on [Microsoft Reactor](https://aka.ms/agentsleague/battles). Watch experienced developers compete in real-time, explaining their approach and architectural decisions as they go.\n\n- **Tue Feb 17, 9 AM PT** — 🎨 Creative Apps battle\n- **Wed Feb 18, 9 AM PT** — 🧠 Reasoning Agents battle\n- **Thu Feb 19, 9 AM PT** — 💼 Enterprise Agents battle\n\nAll sessions are recorded, so you can watch on your own schedule.\n\n### Week 2: Build + AMAs (Feb 24-26)\n\nThis is your time to build and ask questions on Discord. The async format means you work when it suits you, evenings, weekends, whatever fits your schedule.\n\nWe're also hosting AMAs on [Discord](https://aka.ms/agentsleague/discord) where you can ask questions directly to Microsoft experts and product teams:\n\n- **Tue Feb 24, 9 AM PT** — 🎨 Creative Apps AMA\n- **Wed Feb 25, 9 AM PT** — 🧠 Reasoning Agents AMA\n- **Thu Feb 26, 9 AM PT** — 💼 Enterprise Agents AMA\n\nBring your questions, get help when you're stuck, and share what you're building with the community.\n\n## Pick Your Track\n\nWe've created [a starter kit](https://github.com/microsoft/agentsleague/tree/main/starter-kits) for each track with setup guides, project ideas, and example scenarios to help you get started quickly.\n\n### 🎨 Creative Apps\n\n**Tool:** GitHub Copilot (Chat, CLI, or SDK)\n\nBuild innovative, imaginative applications that showcase the potential of AI-assisted development. All application types are welcome, web apps, CLI tools, games, mobile apps, desktop applications, and more.\n\nThe starter kit walks you through GitHub Copilot's different modes and provides prompting tips to get the best results. [View the Creative Apps starter kit](https://github.com/microsoft/agentsleague/blob/main/starter-kits/1-creative-apps/README.md).\n\n### 🧠 Reasoning Agents\n\n**Tool:** Microsoft Foundry (UI or SDK) and/or Microsoft Agent Framework\n\nBuild a multi-agent system that leverages advanced reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems. This track focuses on agents that can plan, reason through multi-step problems, and collaborate.\n\nThe starter kit includes architecture patterns, reasoning strategies (planner-executor, critic/verifier, self-reflection), and integration guides for tools and MCP servers. [View the Reasoning Agents starter kit](https://github.com/microsoft/agentsleague/blob/main/starter-kits/2-reasoning-agents/README.md).\n\n### 💼 Enterprise Agents\n\n**Tool:** M365 Agents Toolkit or Copilot Studio\n\nCreate intelligent agents that extend Microsoft 365 Copilot to address real-world enterprise scenarios. Your agent must work on Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat.\n\n**Bonus points for:** MCP server integration, OAuth security, Adaptive Cards UI, connected agents (multi-agent architecture).
