  "Title": "Azure Container Registry Premium SKU Now Supports 100 TiB Storage",
  "FeedName": "Microsoft Tech Community",
  "Description": "Today, we're excited to announce that **Azure Container Registry Premium SKU** now supports up to **100 TiB** of registry storage—a 2.5x increase from the previous 40 TiB limit, and a 5x increase from the original 20 TiB limit just two years ago. We've also improved **geo-replication data sync speed**, reducing data sync times for new replicas.\n\n![]()\n\nWe're also introducing an **updated Portal experience** for storage capacity visibility—a long-standing customer request. You can now monitor your storage consumption directly from the Monitoring tab in the Azure Portal Overview blade, making it easier to track usage against your registry limits.\n\nImagine you're managing container infrastructure for a large enterprise. Your teams have embraced containerization, migrating critical workloads from VMs to containers for improved composability and deployment velocity. Meanwhile, your AI and machine learning teams are storing increasingly large model artifacts, agent tooling, and pipeline outputs in your registry. You've watched your storage consumption climb steadily toward the 40 TiB limit, and you're evaluating complex workarounds like splitting workloads across multiple registries.\n\nWith today's announcement, that constraint is lifted. Premium SKU registries now support up to 100 TiB, giving you the headroom to consolidate workloads and scale confidently.\n\n## Background: Container and AI Adoption Drive Storage Growth\n\nOrganizations continue to adopt containers at an accelerating pace. The migration from virtual machines to containerized architectures—driven by the composability, portability, and operational benefits of containers—shows no signs of slowing. At the same time, the AI revolution has introduced new storage demands: large language models, vision models, agent frameworks, and their associated tooling all require substantial registry capacity.\n\nThese parallel trends have pushed many enterprises toward the previous 40 TiB limit faster than anticipated.\n\n## The Challenge: Storage Constraints at Scale\n\nFor organizations operating at scale, the 40 TiB limit created operational challenges:\n\n1. **Multi-Registry Complexity**: Teams were forced to split workloads across multiple registries, complicating access control, networking, and operational visibility.\n2. **Architectural Workarounds**: Some organizations implemented custom garbage collection and artifact lifecycle policies specifically to stay under limits, rather than based on actual retention requirements.\n3. **Growth Planning Uncertainty**: Rapidly growing AI workloads made capacity planning difficult, with some organizations uncertain whether they could consolidate new model artifacts in their primary registry.\n4. **Geo-Replication Provisioning**: Syncing data to new geo-replicas for expanding global footprints took longer than desired, slowing regional expansion.\n\n## Introducing 100 TiB Storage Limits\n\nPremium SKU registries now support up to **100 TiB** of storage—a 2.5x increase that provides substantial headroom for continued growth. This limit applies to the total storage across all repositories in a single registry.\n\nWe've also improved **geo-replication data sync speed** when expanding your registry's global footprint with new replicas, as detailed in the table below.\n\n### What's Changing\n\n| Aspect | Previous | New | | --- | --- | --- | | **Premium SKU Storage Limit** | 40 TiB | 100 TiB | | **Basic/Standard SKU Limits** | Unchanged | Unchanged |\n\n### No Action Required\n\nThe new 100 TiB limit is automatically available for all Premium SKU registries. There's no migration, feature flag, or configuration change required—your registry can now grow beyond 40 TiB without any intervention.\n\n## Who Benefits\n\nThis storage increase is particularly valuable for:\n\n- **Enterprise platform teams** managing centralized container registries for large organizations with hundreds of development teams\n- **AI and ML teams** storing large model artifacts, training outputs, and inference containers\n- **Organizations migrating from VMs** who are consolidating legacy workloads into containerized architectures\n- **Global enterprises** using geo-replication across many regions, where storage is replicated to each replica\n\nSome of the world's largest AI and financial services organizations have been operating near the previous limit and will benefit immediately from this increase.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Check Your Current Usage\n\nYou can view your registry's current storage consumption and the new 100 TiB limit in the **Azure Portal** (under the Monitoring tab in the Overview blade) or via CLI:\n\n- # View registry storage usage and limits. The registry size limit will be under MaximumStorageCapacity.\naz acr show-usage --name myregistry --output table\n\nThe Portal, CLI, and REST API/SDKs all now reflect the increased 100 TiB capacity. You can programmatically query your registry's storage usage via the [List Usages REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/container-registry/registries/list-usages), making it easy to integrate capacity monitoring into your existing tooling and dashboards.\n\n### Upgrade to Premium SKU\n\nThe 100 TiB storage limit is exclusive to Premium SKU. If you're on Basic or Standard and need higher storage capacity, upgrading to Premium unlocks the full 100 TiB limit along with geo-replication, enhanced throughput, private endpoints, and other enterprise features:\n- # Upgrade to Premium SKU\naz acr update --name myregistry --sku Premium\n\n## Related Resources\n\n- [Azure Container Registry service tiers and limits](https://aka.ms/acr/skus)\n- [Geo-replication in Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-geo-replication)\n- [Best practices for Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-best-practices)\n- [Azure Container Registry pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-registry/)\n- [List Usages REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/container-registry/registries/list-usages)",
