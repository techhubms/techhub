The agent handles detection, diagnosis, remediation, and reporting—all autonomously.\n\n### 📺 Watch the Demo\n\nThis content was presented at **.NET Day 2025**. Watch the full session to see Azure SRE Agent in action:\n\n🎬 **[Fix it before they feel it - .NET Day 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kx_6SB-mhgg)**\n\n### 🎯 What You'll See in This Demo\n\nWatch as we intentionally deploy \"bad\" code to production and observe how the SRE Agent:\n\n1. **Detects the degradation** — Compares live response times against learned baselines\n2. **Takes autonomous action** — Executes a slot swap to roll back to healthy code\n3. **Communicates the incident** — Posts to Teams and creates a GitHub issue\n4. **Generates reports** — Summarizes MTTD/MTTR metrics for stakeholders\n\n### 🚀 Key Capabilities\n\n| Capability | What It Shows | | --- | --- | | **Proactive Baseline Learning** | Agent learns normal response times and stores them in a knowledge base | | **Real-time Anomaly Detection** | Instant comparison of current vs. baseline metrics | | **Autonomous Remediation** | Agent executes Azure CLI commands to swap slots without human approval | | **Cross-platform Communication** | Automatic Teams posts and GitHub issue creation | | **Incident Reporting** | End-of-day email summaries with deployment health metrics |\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nThe solution uses Azure SRE Agent with three specialized sub-agents working together:\n\n### Components\n\n**Application Layer:**\n\n- .NET 9 Web API running on Azure App Service\n- Application Insights for telemetry collection\n- Azure Monitor Alerts for incident triggers\n\n**Azure SRE Agent:**\n\n- **AvgResponseTime Sub-Agent**: Captures baseline metrics every 15 minutes, stores in Knowledge Store\n- **DeploymentHealthCheck Sub-Agent**: Triggered by deployment alerts, compares metrics to baseline, auto-remediates\n- **DeploymentReporter Sub-Agent**: Generates daily summary emails from Teams activity\n\n**External Integrations:**\n\n- GitHub (issue creation, semantic code search, Copilot assignment)\n- Microsoft Teams (deployment summaries)\n- Outlook (summary reports)\n\n### Demo Flow\n\n**[View Step-by-Step Instructions →](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/tree/main/samples/proactive-reliability#demo-flow)**\n\n| Step | Action | | --- | --- | | **Step 1** | [Deploy Infrastructure + Applications](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/tree/main/samples/proactive-reliability#step-1-setup-demo-environment) | | **Step 2** | [Create Sub-Agents, Triggers & Schedules](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/tree/main/samples/proactive-reliability#step-2-configure-azure-sre-agent) | | **Step 3** | [Swap bad code, watch agent remediate](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/tree/main/samples/proactive-reliability#step-3-run-the-demo) |\n\n### Setting Up the Demo\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- Azure subscription with Contributor access\n- Azure CLI installed and logged in (az login)\n- .NET 9.0 SDK\n- PowerShell 7.0+\n\n#### Step 1: Deploy Infrastructure\n\ncd scripts .\\1-setup-demo.ps1 -ResourceGroupName \"sre-demo-rg\" -AppServiceName \"sre-demo-app-12345\"\n\nThis script will:\n\n1.
