It integrates with Azure APIs and Microsoft Entra ID to authenticate, explore NetApp accounts, capacity pools, and volumes, and leverage AI-powered guidance for configuration and optimization.\n\n- Browse NetApp accounts, capacity pools, and volumes from an Azure Netapp Files - focused explorer in VS Code.\n- Use AI-assisted workflows to generate ARM templates, analyze existing environments, and get optimization recommendations inline with your code workflows.\n- Work across multiple Azure subscriptions within a single tenant, already reducing portal hopping for complex enterprise environments.\n\nWith the latest enhancements, this foundation now extends across tenants and into your application code with language-aware mount snippets.\n\n# Multi-tenant support\n\nMulti-tenant environments are the norm for enterprises, but until now, managing Azure NetApp Files resources across multiple Azure tenants often meant constant sign‑in/out churn and fragmented context. The new multi‑tenant support lets you stay in one VS Code session while working across all your Azure tenants and subscriptions.\n\n- **One extension, all your tenants**: Log into more than just your “home” tenant and seamlessly switch between tenant and subscription contexts in the same VS Code workspace.\n- **Cross-tenant visibility:** Analyze and manage Azure NetApp Files volumes across tenants and subscriptions, enabling consistent patterns for performance, data protection, and lifecycle management from one IDE.\n- **Compliance and security alignment:** Centrally view how volumes are provisioned across tenants so platform teams can align with tenant‑specific compliance, data residency, and security requirements while still working in dev tooling.\n- **Cost and usage optimization:** With multi-subscription and multi-tenant visibility, it becomes easier to spot underutilized capacity, standardize service tiers (Standard/Premium/Ultra).\n\n**The result:** no more logging out and back in just to investigate an issue in a different tenant—switch, inspect, and fix directly from VS Code\n\n# Context-Aware Mount Code generation\n\nThe second major capability in this release is language-aware, right‑click mount code generation, designed for teams that move fast and do not want to keep translating documentation examples into their preferred language or framework. Instead of hunting through docs and re‑writing mount commands, you generate production‑ready mount code that matches the language of the file you are editing, then paste and run.\n\n- **Right‑click integration** **:** From the Azure NetApp Files Explorer, right‑click any volume and choose “Insert mount command” to trigger the workflow.\n\n![]()**File type detection:** The extension auto‑detects the active file type (for example Python, JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, .NET languages, Java, YAML) and tailors the snippet to that language and pattern.\n- **Language coverage:** v1.1.0 supports Python (.py), JavaScript (.js), TypeScript (.ts), C# (.cs), Java (.java), and YAML (.yml, .yaml), with syntax that aligns to common best practices for each ecosystem.\n- **Protocol awareness:** The workflow understands Azure NetApp Files protocol options such as NFSv3 and NFSv4.1, prompting you where needed so that the generated code matches your chosen protocol and volume configuration.\n\n**You stay in flow:** work in a .py file, get Python code; switch to a .ts file, get TypeScript; move to infrastructure YAML, get the right YAML representation for your mount configuration.\n\n# How does it work\n\nUnder the hood, the new “Insert mount command” workflow combines Azure authentication, resource discovery, and code generation into a single guided, low-friction path that ends with a ready‑to‑run snippet in your file. This compresses what used to be multiple trips between Azure Portal, docs, and terminals into one cohesive in‑editor experience.\n\n## Typical flow\n\n1. **Authentication and context**\n1. The extension validates that you are authenticated against Azure, with the correct subscription selected and tokens refreshed automatically.\n2. **NetApp account and pool selection**\n1. You get a quick‑pick list of NetApp accounts (with names and locations) and then capacity pools (with their service level: Standard, Premium, or Ultra).\n3. **Volume and protocol selection**\n1. From the chosen pool, the extension lists volumes, showing protocol (NFSv3, NFSv4.1) and mount target IPs retrieved directly from Azure APIs.\n4. **Code generation and insertion**\n1. The extension auto‑detects the active file’s language, generates mount commands or connection code tailored to that language and protocol, and inserts the snippet at your cursor position.\n2. The cursor is then placed after the generated block so you can immediately continue coding; unsupported file types surface a clear warning with a list of supported types.\n\nFrom a developer’s perspective, the workflow feels like another refactor or code action: right‑click, pick the volume, confirm protocol, and keep coding with mount logic already in place.\n\n# Getting started with v1.1.0\n\nIf your team is already using the Azure NetApp Files VS Code extension, upgrading to v1.1.0 is a straightforward way to centralize multi‑tenant operations and reduce friction when wiring applications to Azure NetApp Files volumes. If you are new to the extension, it is available directly from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NetApp.anf-vscode-extension) and installs in seconds on any VS Code environment that meets the baseline requirements.\n\n- Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view, and search for “Azure NetApp Files” to install or update the extension.\n- Sign in with Microsoft Entra ID, connect the tenants and subscriptions you manage, and open the Azure NetApp Files Explorer view to start exploring multi‑tenant resources.\n- Open an application file in one of the supported languages, right‑click an Azure NetApp Files volume, and try “Insert mount command” to see language‑aware mount generation in action.\n\n# Learn more\n\n- **Install:** [VS Code Marketplace – Azure NetApp Files Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NetApp.anf-vscode-extension)\n- **Learn:** [Quick Start Guide & Documentation](https://github.com/NetApp/anf-vscode-extension/blob/main/ANF-Extension-Quick-Start-Guide.pdf)\n- **Build:** [Azure NetApp Files Storage Templates](https://github.com/NetApp/azure-netapp-files-storage)\n- **PostgreSQL with Azure NetApp Files**– [Specialized ARM template for PostgreSQL deployments.](https://github.com/NetApp/azure-netapp-files-storage/blob/main/arm-templates/db/postgresql-vm-anf/README.md)\n- **Microsoft Tech Community** – [Learn how AI accelerates cloud-native development](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearchitectureblog/accelerating-cloud-native-development-with-ai-powered-azure-netapp-files-vs-code/4464852)\n- **Reach out to us at:** [1P_ProductGrowth@netapp.com](mailto:1P_ProductGrowth@netapp.com)",
