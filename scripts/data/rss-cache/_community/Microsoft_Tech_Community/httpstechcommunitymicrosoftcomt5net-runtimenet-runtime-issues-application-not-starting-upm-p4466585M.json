  "Author": "JY_2013",
  "EnhancedContent": "Hello,\n\nWe have a .NET based application built using the .NET framework 8.0. The application runtimeconfig.json file shows this: MyApp.runtimeconfig.json \"tfm\": \"net8.0\", \"frameworks\": [ { \"name\": \"Microsoft.NETCore.App\", \"version\": \"8.0.0\" }, { \"name\": \"Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App\", \"version\": \"8.0.0\" } ],\n\nPlease note that we have Published the application and verified that only .NET version 8.0.16 components, DLLs etc are required. Anything higher than this does not show up.\n\nFrom the cmd prompt, the following runtimes are shown to be installed on the system: &gt;dotnet --list-runtimes Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.21 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App] Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App] Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.20 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nHowever, when we try to start a Windows service which is installed as part of the application, it does not start up, and the Windows Event Viewer shows the following error: \"Description: A .NET application failed. Application: MyAppControllerService.exe Path: C:\\MyApp\\MyAppControllerService.exe Message: You must install or update .NET to run this application.\n\nApp: C:\\MyApp\\MyAppControllerService.exe Architecture: x64 Framework: 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '8.0.21' (x64) .NET location: C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\\n\nThe following frameworks were found: 8.0.20 at [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nLearn more: https://aka.ms/dotnet/app-launch-failed\n\nTo install missing framework, download: https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?framework=Microsoft.NETCore.App&framework\\_version=8.0.21&arch=x64&rid=win-x64&os=win10\"\n\nSo, the issue is, even with Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.20 being installed on the system, it still asks for the .NET 8.0 Runtime (v8.0.21) to be installed. Please let me know why this is so?\n\nSince, as per this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows\n\n.NET Desktop Runtime includes the .NET runtime as well, and Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.20 is installed.\n\nThanks in advance, JY",
