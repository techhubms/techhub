  "Description": "Today, Microsoft is announcing the general availability of Azure’s new AMD based Virtual Machines (VMs) powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC™ (Turin) processors. These VMs include general-purpose (Dasv7, Dalsv7), memory-optimized (Easv7), and compute-optimized (Fasv7, Falsv7, Famsv7) series, available with or without local disks.\n\nAzure’s latest AMD based VMs offer faster CPU performance, greater scalability, and flexible configurations, making them the ideal choice for high performance, cost efficiency, and diverse workloads.\n\nKey improvements include up to 35% better CPU performance and price-performance compared to equivalent v6 AMD-based VMs. Workload-specific gains are significant—up to 25% for Java applications, up to 65% for in-memory cache applications, up to 80% for crypto workloads, and up to 130% for web server applications just to name a few.\n\nDalsv7-series VMs are cost-efficient for low memory workloads like web servers, video encoding, and batch processing. Dasv7-series suit general computing tasks such as e-commerce, web front ends, virtualization, customer relationship management applications (CRM), and entry to mid-range databases. Easv7-series target memory-heavy workloads like enterprise applications, data warehousing, business intelligence, in-memory analytics and more. Falsv7-, Fasv7-, and Famsv7 series deliver full-core performance without Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) for compute-intensive tasks like scientific simulations, financial modeling, gaming and more. You can now choose constrained-core VM sizes — reducing the vCPU total by 50% or 75% while maintaining the other resources.\n\nDasv7, Dalsv7, and Easv7 VMs now scale up to 160 vCPUs, an increase from 96 vCPUs in the previous generation. The Fasv7, Falsv7, and Famsv7 VMs, which do not include Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), support up to 80 vCPUs—up from 64 vCPUs in the prior generation—and introduce a new 1-core option. These VMs offer a maximum boost CPU frequency of up to 4.5 GHz for faster compute-intensive operations.\n\nThe new VMs deliver increased memory capacity —up to 640 GiB for Dasv7 and 1280 GiB for Easv7—making them ideal for memory-intensive workloads. They also support three memory (GiB)-to-vCPU ratios: 2:1 (Dalsv7-series, Daldsv7-series, Falsv7-series and Faldsv7-series), 4:1 (Dasv7-series, Dadsv7-series, Fasv7-series and Fadsv7-series), and 8:1 (Easv7-series, Eadsv7-series, Famsv7-series and Famdsv7-series).\n\nRemote storage performance is improved up to 20% higher IOPS, up to 50% greater throughput, while local storage performance offers up to 55% higher throughput. Network performance is also enhanced up to 75% compared to corresponding D-series and E-series v6 VMs. New VM series Fadsv7, Faldsv7, and Famdsv7, introduce local disk support.\n\nThe new VMs leverage [Azure Boost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-boost/overview) technology to enhance performance and security, utilize the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter ([MANA](https://aka.ms/manadocs)), and support the [NVMe](https://aka.ms/NVMeFAQ) protocol for both local and remote disks.\n\nThe 5th Generation AMD EPYC™ processor family, based on the newest ‘Zen 5’ core, provides enhanced capabilities for these new Azure’s AMD based VM series such as AVX-512 with a full 512-bit data path for vector and floating-point operations, higher memory bandwidth, and improved instructions per clock compared to the previous generation. These updates provide the ability to handle compute-intensive tasks for AI and machine learning, scientific simulations, and financial analytics, among others. AMD [Infinity Guard](https://aka.ms/AMDInfinityGuard) hardware-based security features, such as Transparent Secure Memory Encryption (TSME), continue in this generation to ensure sensitive information remains secure.\n\nThese VMs are available in the following Azure regions: Australia East, Central US, Germany West Central, Japan East, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, UK South, West Europe, West US 2, and West US 3. The large 160 vCPU Easv7-series and Eadsv7-series sizes are available in North Europe, South Central US, West Europe, and West US 2. More regions are coming in 2026. Refer to [Product Availability by Region](https://aka.ms/ProductAvailabilitybyRegion) for the latest information.\n\n![]()\n\n**Our customers have shared the benefits they’ve observed with these new VMs:**\n\n*“Elastic enables customers to drive innovation and cost-efficiency with our observability, security, and search solutions on Azure. In our testing, Azure’s latest Daldsv7 VMs provided up to 13% better indexing throughput compared to previous generation Daldsv6 VMs, and we are looking forward to the improved performance for Elasticsearch users deploying on Azure.” — Yuvraj Gupta, Director, Product Management, Elastic*\n\n*“The Easv7 series of Azure VMs offers a balanced mix of CPU, memory, storage, and network performance that suits the majority of Oracle Database configurations very well. The 80 Gbps network with the jumbo frame capability is especially helpful for efficient operation of FlashGrid Cluster with Oracle RAC on Azure VMs.” — Art Danielov, CEO, FlashGrid*\n\n*\"Our analysis indicates that Azure’s new AMD based v7 series Virtual Machines demonstrate significantly higher performance compared to the v6 series, particularly in single-thread ratings. This advancement is highly beneficial, as several of our critical applications, such as ArcGIS Enterprise, are single-threaded and CPU-bound. Consequently, these faster v7 series VMs have resulted in improved performance with the same number of users, evidenced by lower server utilization and faster client-side response times.\" — Thomas Buchmann, Senior Cloud Architect, VertiGIS*\n\n**Here’s what our technology partners are saying***:*\n\n*“AMD and Microsoft have built one of the industry’s most successful cloud partnerships, bringing over 60 VM series to market through years of deep engineering collaboration. With the new v7 Azure VMs powered by 5th Gen AMD EPYC processors, we’re setting a new benchmark for performance, efficiency, and scalability—giving customers the proven, leadership compute they expect from AMD in the world’s most demanding cloud environments.”* *—* *Steve Berg, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of the Server CPU Cloud Business Group at AMD*\n\n*“Our collaboration with Microsoft continues to empower developers and enterprises alike. The new AMD based v7-series VMs on Azure offer a powerful foundation for the full spectrum of modern workloads, from development to production AI/ML pipelines. We are excited to support this launch, ensuring every user gets a seamless experience on Ubuntu, with the enterprise security and long-term stability of Ubuntu Pro available for their most critical systems.\" — Jehudi Castro-Sierra, Public Cloud Alliances Director*\n\n*\"The new Azure Da/Ea/Fa v7-series AMD Turin-based instances running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server provide a significant performance uplift during initial tests. They show an impressive 20%-40% increase with typical Linux kernel compilation tasks compared to the same instance sizes of the v6 series. This demonstrates the enhanced capabilities the v7 series brings to our joint customers seeking maximum efficiency and performance for their critical applications.” — Peter Schinagl, Sr. Technical Architect, SUSE*\n\nYou can learn more about these latest Azure AMD based VMs by visiting the specification pages at [Dasv7-series](https://aka.ms/Dasv7-series), [Dadsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Dadsv7-series), [Dalsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Dalsv7-series), [Daldsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Daldsv7-series), [Easv7-series](https://aka.ms/Easv7-series), [Eadsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Eadsv7-series), [Fasv7-series](https://aka.ms/Fasv7-series), [Fadsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Fadsv7-series), [Falsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Falsv7-series), [Faldsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Faldsv7-series), [Famsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Famsv7-series) , [Famdsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Famdsv7-series), [constrained-core sizes](https://aka.ms/constrained-coresizes).\n\nFor pricing details, visit the [Azure Virtual Machines pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines) page.
