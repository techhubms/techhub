You’re no longer troubleshooting a single environment—you’re looking for patterns across your entire fleet: Which sites are trending with a specific health issue? Where are workload deployments increasing over time, do we have enough capacity available? Which clusters are outliers compared to the rest?\n\nToday we’re sharing **Azure Local LENS**: a **free**, community-driven Azure Workbook designed to help you gain deep insights across a large Azure Local fleet—quickly and consistently—so you can move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive operations.\n\n**Get the workbook and step-by-step instructions to deploy it here:** [https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS](https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS)\n\n## Who is it for?\n\nThis workbook is especially useful if you manage or support:\n\n- **Large Azure Local fleets** distributed across many sites (retail, manufacturing, branch offices, healthcare, etc.).\n- **Central operations teams** that need standardized health/update views.\n- **Architects who want to aggregate data** to gain insights in cluster and workload deployment trends over time.\n\n## What is Azure Local LENS?\n\nAzure Local - Lifecycle, Events & Notification Status (*or LENS*) workbook brings together the signals you need to understand your Azure Local estate through a fleet lens. Instead of jumping between individual resources, you can use a consistent set of views to compare instances, spot outliers, and drill into the focus areas that need attention.\n\n- **Fleet-first design:** Start with an estate-wide view, then drill down to a specific site/cluster using the seven tabs in the workbook.\n- **Operational consistency:** Standard dashboards help teams align on “what good looks like” across environments, update trends, health check results and more.\n- **Actionable insights:** Identify hotspots and trends early so you can prioritize remediation and plan health remediation, updates and workload capacity with confidence.\n\n## What insights does it provide?\n\nAzure Local LENS is built to help you answer the questions that matter at scale, such as:\n\n- **Fleet scale overview and connection status:** How many Azure Local instances do you have, and what are their connection, health and update status?\n- **Workload deployment trends:** Where have you deployed Azure Local VMs and AKS Arc clusters, how many do you have in total, are they connected and in a healthy state?\n- **Top issues to prioritize:** What are the common signals across your estate that deserve operational focus, such as update health checks, extension failures or Azure Resource Bridge connectivity issues?\n- **Updates:** What is your overall update compliance status for Solution and SBE updates? What is the average, standard deviation or 95th percentile update duration run times for your fleet?\n- **Drilldown workflow:** After spotting an outlier, what does the instance-level view show, so you can act or link directly to Azure portal for more actions and support?\n\n## Get started in minutes\n\nIf you are managing Azure Local instances, give Azure Local LENS a try and see how quickly a fleet-wide view can help with day-to-day management, helping to surface trends & actionable insights. The workbook is an open-source, community-driven project, which can be accessed using a public GitHub repository, which includes **full step-by-step instructions for setup** at [https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS.](https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS)\n\nMost teams can deploy the workbook and start exploring insights in a matter of minutes. (*depending on your environment*).\n\nAn example of the “Azure Local Instances” tab:\n\n## How teams are using fleet dashboards like LENS\n\n- **Weekly fleet review:** Use a standard set of views to review top outliers and trend shifts, then assign follow-ups.\n- **Update planning:** Identify clusters with system health check failures, and prioritize resolving the issues based on frequency of the issue category.\n- **Update progress:** Review clusters update status (*InProgress, Failed, Success*) and take action based on trends and insights from real-time data.\n- **Baseline validation:** Spot clusters that consistently differ from the norm—can be a sign of configuration or environmental difference, such as network access, policies, operational procedures or other factors.\n\n## Feedback and what’s next\n\nThis workbook is a community driven, open source project intended to be practical and easy to adopt. The project is not a Microsoft‑supported offering. If you encounter any issues, have feedback, or a new feature request, please raise an [Issue on the GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS/issues), **** so we can track discussions, prioritize improvements, and keep updates transparent for everyone.\n\n## Author Bio\n\n[Neil Bird is a Principal Program Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-bird-/) in the Azure Edge & Platform Engineering team at Microsoft.
