This step is optional, as implementation will create test data if not available.\n5. **Implement tests:** Generate MSTest code enforcing SDK constraints and required annotations.\n6. **Validate:** Build and run tests; refine specs and data as needed.\n7. **Batch (optional):** Apply the flow across all workflows once scaffolding is verified.\n\n| Skill | Description | Prompt File | | --- | --- | --- | | Discover Workflows | Discover workflow definitions, summarize triggers/actions, and produce a mock inventory. | .github/prompts/la-unit-tests-discover.prompt.md | | Create Test Cases | Create unit test cases from a workflow definition; define intent, inputs, mock plan, and expected outcomes. | .github/prompts/la-unit-tests-create-cases.prompt.md | | Write Speckit Specs | Write and maintain Speckit-style specification documents for reusable scenarios. | .github/prompts/la-unit-tests-speckit-specs.prompt.md | | Implement Tests | Implement MSTest unit tests using the Automated Test SDK with enforced constraints. | .github/prompts/la-unit-tests-implement.prompt.md | | Generate Test Data | Generate trigger/action mock payloads and typed outputs for success and failure variants. | .github/prompts/la-unit-tests-generate-test-data.prompt.md | | Project Batch | Execute project-wide operations with scaffolding verification and roll-up reporting. | .github/prompts/la-unit-tests-project-batch.prompt.md |\n\n### Logic Apps Data Map Unit Test Author\n\nSpecialist agent for authoring Data Map unit tests from LML or XSLT using MSTest (net8.0).
