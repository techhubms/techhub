As part of this process:\n- The *trustPolicy* property will be removed from ARM APIs in a future version.\n- The Azure Policy **[aliases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/definition-structure-alias)** referencing this property will eventually be impacted.\n- Affected aliases include:\n- *Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/trustPolicy*\n- *Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/trustPolicy.type*\n- *Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/trustPolicy.status*\n- Key findings:\n- No built-in policy definitions currently use these aliases, so no built-ins will be deprecated because of this feature deprecation.\n- The alias *trustPolicy.status* is modifiable, so any active modify policies targeting this property will break when the property is removed. This alias will be removed.\n\n# Impacts on Azure Policy\n\nIf you have active policy assignments referencing these aliases, you will need to update or remove them during the deprecation period to avoid future compliance issues:\n\n- Existing policies will eventually become non-compliant for any new ACR resources. For example, if a policy assignment requires *trustPolicy* to be enabled (*Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/trustPolicy.status == \"enabled\"*), but the ACR *trustPolicy* property can no longer be set due to deprecation, then any new ACRs created after that point will automatically be noncompliant with the policy.\n- Policies using the **modifiable alias** (*trustPolicy.status*) will fail when the alias is deleted or marked non-modifiable at the end of the deprecation period.\n\n# Steps to Mitigate the Impact\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition:\n\n1. **Identify Affected Policies and Assignments:** Locate any custom policy definitions in your environment referencing the affected aliases.\n2. **Update Policy Definitions:** Remove or replace references to *trustPolicy* properties in your policy definitions. If the policy's only purpose is to evaluate the ACR *trustPolicy*, consider removing the definition altogether.\n3. **Test and Validate:** After updating policies, validate that they enforce compliance as intended without relying on deprecated properties.\n4. **Monitor for Updates:** Stay informed by monitoring Azure Container Registry [retirement documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-content-trust-deprecation) for more details on transitioning from Docker Content Trust to **Notary Project**.\n\nPublished Dec 17, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[!\\[ShannonHicks&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-3.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/shannonhicks/1454601) [ShannonHicks](/users/shannonhicks/1454601) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined July 13, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/shannonhicks/1454601)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azuregovernanceandmanagementblog [Azure Governance and Management Blog](/category/azure/blog/azuregovernanceandmanagementblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
