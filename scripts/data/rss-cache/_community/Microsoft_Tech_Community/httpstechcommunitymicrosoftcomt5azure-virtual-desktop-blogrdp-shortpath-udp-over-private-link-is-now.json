  "Description": "UDP support over Private Link for Azure Virtual Desktop is now generally available. This release enables a direct, high‑performance, UDP‑based RDP connection between AVD session hosts and clients over Azure Private Link using RDP Shortpath for managed networks.\n\nThis capability complements the existing TCP-based RDP connectivity over Private Link. Together, these options support customers with strict private network boundaries by allowing RDP traffic over both TCP and UDP transports, using defined private IPs when Private Link is in use.‑based RDP connectivity over Private Link.

In the Azure portal, open your **Azure Virtual Desktop Host pools** or **Workspaces** resource.\n2. Go to **Networking** → **Public access**.\n3. Under **Public access**, choose one of the following:\n\no Enable public access for end users, use private access for session hosts, or\n\no Disable public access and use private access When either of these options is selected, the portal displays an additional opt in checkbox:\n\n![]()![]()\n\n4. Turn on **Allow Direct UDP network path over Private Link** to allow UDP‑based transports (for example, RDP Shortpath for managed networks).\n\n5. Go to the **RDP Shortpath** tab and disable the public Shortpath options:\n\no RDP Shortpath for public networks (via STUN)\n\no RDP Shortpath for public networks (via TURN) The portal will block Save and show a Configuration Error if these public options are still enabled.\n\n![]()![]()\n\n6. Select **Save**.\n\n| **Important Note:**<br><br><br><br>The **UDP opt‑in checkbox is mandatory** for enabling **RDP Shortpath over Private Link**.<br>If this checkbox is **not selected**, RDP Shortpath will be **blocked** for all Private Link connections, and sessions will continue using the WebSocket‑based TCP transport.<br><br>Also note that **opting in for UDP does not automatically complete the end‑to‑end Shortpath setup**. You must still configure the required Shortpath settings on your session hosts and network. For full configuration steps, see the official guidance for [RDP Shortpath for Azure Virtual Desktop in the Azure Virtual Desktop documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/rdp-shortpath?tabs=managed-networks). | | --- |\n\n## Learn more\n\nFor more information about Private Link, check out the following articles on Microsoft Learn:\n\n- **[Private Link for Azure Virtual Desktop – Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/private-link-overview)**\nLearn how Private Link secures feed discovery, feed download, and host pool connections.\n- **[Configure Private Link with Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/private-link-setup?tabs=azure%2Cportal%2Cportal-2)**\nStep by step guidance for creating private endpoints for workspaces, host pools, and initial feed discovery.\n- Learn more details about [RDP Shortpath for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/rdp-shortpath?tabs=managed-networks).\n\nStay up to date!
