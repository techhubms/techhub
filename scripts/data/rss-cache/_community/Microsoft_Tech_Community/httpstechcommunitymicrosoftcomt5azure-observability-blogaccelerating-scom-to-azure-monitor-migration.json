  "EnhancedContent": "## Modernizing monitoring is no longer just about replacing tools, it’s about adopting a platform approach that scales with cloud-first operations. More and more teams are standardizing on Azure Monitor as the central place to collect telemetry, query logs with KQL, build alerting strategies, and publish operational dashboards. At the same time, many enterprises still rely on System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) and years of investment in Management Packs that encode critical monitoring knowledge.\nThis post looks at that real-world transition: how to move from SCOM’s Management Pack model to Azure Monitor’s logs, alerts, and data collection patterns-without starting from scratch.\n\n## Accelerating SCOM to Azure Monitor Migrations with Automated Analysis and ARM Template Generation\n\n**Azure Monitor** has become the foundation for modern, cloud-scale monitoring on Azure.
