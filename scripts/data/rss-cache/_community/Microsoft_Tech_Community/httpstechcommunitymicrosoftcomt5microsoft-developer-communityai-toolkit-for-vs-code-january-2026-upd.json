This month, we’ve focused on aligning with the latest GitHub Copilot standards, introducing powerful new debugging tools, and enhancing our support for enterprise-grade models via Microsoft Foundry.\n\n## 💡 From Copilot Instructions to Agent Skills\n\nThe biggest architectural shift following the latest [VS Code Copilot standards](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills), in v0.28.1 is the transition from **Copilot Instructions** to **Copilot Skills**. This transition has equipped GitHub Copilot specialized skills on developing AI agents using Microsoft Foundry and Agent Framework in a cost-efficient way.\n\nIn AI Toolkit, we have migrated our Copilot Tools from the Custom Instructions to Agent Skills. This change allows for a more capable integration within GitHub Copilot Chat.\n\n- **🔄 Enhanced AIAgentExpert:** Our custom agent now has a deeper understanding of workflow code generation and evaluation planning/execution.\n- **🧹Automatic Migration:** When you upgrade to **v0.28.1**, the toolkit will automatically clean up your old instructions to ensure a seamless transition to the new skills-based framework.\n\n## 🏗️ Major Enhancements to Agent Development\n\nOur **v0.28.0** milestone release brought significant improvements to how agents are authored and authenticated.\n\n### 🔒 Anthropic & Entra Auth Support\n\nWe’ve expanded the **Agent Builder** and **Playground** to support Anthropic models using **Entra Auth** types. This provides enterprise developers with a more secure way to leverage Claude models within the Agent Framework while maintaining strict authentication standards.\n\n### 🏢 Foundry-First Development\n\nWe are prioritizing the **Microsoft Foundry** ecosystem to provide a more robust development experience:\n\n- **Foundry v2:** Code generation for agents now defaults to Foundry v2. ⚡\n- **Eval Tool:** You can now generate evaluation code directly within the toolkit to create and run evaluations in Microsoft Foundry. 📊\n- **Model Catalog:** We’ve optimized the Model Catalog to prioritize Foundry models and improved general loading performance. 🏎️\n\n## 💻 Performance and Local Models\n\nFor developers building on Windows, we continue to optimize the local model experience:\n\n- **Profiling for Windows ML:** Version 0.28.0 introduces profiling features for Windows ML-based local models, allowing you to monitor performance and resource utilization directly within VS Code.\n- **Platform Optimization:** To keep the interface clean, we’ve removed the Windows AI API tab from the Model Catalog when running on Linux and macOS platforms.\n\n## 🐛 Squashing Bugs & Polishing the Experience\n\n- **Codespaces Fix:** Resolved a crash occurring when selecting images in the Playground while using GitHub Codespaces.\n- **Resource Management:** Fixed a delay where newly added models wouldn't immediately appear in the \"My Resources\" view.\n- **Claude Compatibility:** Fixed an issue where non-empty content was required for Claude models when used via the AI Toolkit in GitHub Copilot.\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\nReady to experience the future of AI development?
