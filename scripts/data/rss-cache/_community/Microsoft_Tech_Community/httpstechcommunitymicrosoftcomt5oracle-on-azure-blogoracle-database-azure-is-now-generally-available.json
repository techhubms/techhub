  "Title": "Oracle Database@Azure Is Now Generally Available in West Europe (Amsterdam)",
  "FeedName": "Microsoft Tech Community",
  "Description": "As organizations across Europe accelerate their cloud modernization and AI adoption, data locality, compliance, and performance remain critical decision factors. Over the past year, Microsoft and Oracle have worked closely to rapidly expand the global footprint of **Oracle Database@Azure**, bringing Oracle’s enterprise‑grade database services natively into Azure datacenters around the world.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce that **Oracle Database@Azure is now generally available in the West Europe (Amsterdam) Azure region**.\n\nThis new region enables customers across Western Europe to run mission‑critical Oracle databases closer to their Azure applications—meeting stringent regional compliance requirements while benefiting from ultra‑low latency and a fully integrated Azure experience.\n\n## Why West Europe (Amsterdam) matters\n\nRegional availability is essential for enterprises operating in regulated industries and distributed geographies. With Oracle Database@Azure now available in West Europe, customers can:\n\n- **Meet EU data residency and sovereignty requirements** by keeping Oracle data within the Netherlands\n- **Reduce application latency** by colocating Oracle databases and Azure services within the same Azure datacenter region\n- **Simplify compliance and risk management** for industries such as financial services, public sector, utilities, retail, and healthcare\n- **Design resilient architectures** with regional and in‑country disaster recovery options\n\nThis expansion builds on the growing European footprint of Oracle Database@Azure and complements existing regions across EMEA, North America, APAC, and Brazil.\n\n## A unified Oracle and Azure data platform—without re‑architecting\n\nOracle Database@Azure delivers a unique architecture that colocates **Oracle‑managed database services on Oracle Exadata infrastructure directly inside Azure datacenters**. This allows Azure applications to access Oracle databases over Azure’s internal network fabric, delivering predictable performance and microsecond‑level latency—without the complexity of cross‑cloud networking.\n\nIn the West Europe region, customers can run:\n\n- **Oracle Exadata Database Service** (Dedicated and Exascale Infrastructure)\n- **Oracle Autonomous Database**\n- **Oracle Base Database Service**\n- **Oracle GoldenGate** and **Autonomous Recovery Services**\n\nThese services integrate natively with Azure identity, networking, security, and management services, enabling customers to modernize at their own pace while preserving existing Oracle investments and operational practices.\n\n## Built for European enterprise workloads\n\nFor many organizations, migrating Oracle databases has historically required complex re‑architecture or compromises on performance and governance. With Oracle Database@Azure in West Europe, customers can:\n\n- Migrate existing Oracle databases to Azure without code changes\n- Use familiar Oracle tools and skills while adopting Azure AI, analytics, and application services\n- Preserve licensing flexibility through BYOL or license‑included options\n- Accelerate modernization initiatives while minimizing risk and disruption\n\nThis architecture is particularly well‑suited for enterprises running applications in Azure alongside deeply customized Oracle databases that are difficult to replace or refactor.\n\n## Get started in West Europe today\n\nOracle Database@Azure is now available in **33 regions worldwide**, including West Europe (Amsterdam). Customers can deploy Oracle database services directly from Azure and begin modernizing their Oracle workloads with confidence.\n\n**Learn more**: [https://aka.ms/oracle](https://aka.ms/oracle)\n\n**Attend the EMEA webinar on March 4th**: [Unlock the Future of Oracle Workloads: Oracle Database@Azure](https://msevents.microsoft.com/event?id=166625427&ocid=AIDN%2FA_LINKEDIN_oo_spl100009889280659)\n\n**Read the blog: [Microsoft at Oracle AI World Tour](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/oracleonazureblog/microsoft-hits-the-road-with-oracle-ai-world-tour-2026-/4477598)**\n\n**Technical documentation**: [Overview - Oracle Database@Azure | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/database-overview)\n\n**Get skilled**: [https://aka.ms/ODAA_Learn](https://aka.ms/ODAA_Learn)\n\n**Microsoft Azure Region policy:** [Azure region pairs and nonpaired regions | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-paired)",
