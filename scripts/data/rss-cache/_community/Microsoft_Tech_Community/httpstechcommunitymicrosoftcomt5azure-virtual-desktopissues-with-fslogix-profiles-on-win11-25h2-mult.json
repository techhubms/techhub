  "Description": "Hey guys\n\nwe have currently lot of issues with AVD and FSLogix 26.01. There seems to be an issue that the profile container isnt't unmounted correctly. We have lot's of users who are not able to login correctly because the profile can't be mounted because its already in use by another process.\n\nI'm currently looking what could cause that. We use a Azure files storage were i don't see any issues. It looks like a process within the userprofile is blocking the unload of the profile.\n\nShould i be able to see in the logs of FSLogix which process is causing this. Or what is a effective way to troubleshoot that?\n\nThanks for any help\n\nBest regards\n\nMarc",
