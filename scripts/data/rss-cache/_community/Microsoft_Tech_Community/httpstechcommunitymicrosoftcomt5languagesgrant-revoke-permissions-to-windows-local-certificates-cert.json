  "Description": "I am working on granting/revoking permissions to windows local certificates (certlm) using Visual C++ 2022. The challenge is that this needs to be performed in non-admin privileges. We would need to remove \"Everyone\" permissions and grant read permissions for our NT Service account to windows local certificates (certlm). Is it possible to perform under non-admin privilege? It would be great help if can get solution for this.",
