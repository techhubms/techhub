  "Title": "Welcome to Azure SRE Agent community hub",
  "Description": "If you’re building, running, or breaking things with **Azure SRE Agent**, this space is for you.\n\nWe’re excited to open the **Azure SRE Agent Community Hub**—a new discussion space where developers and reliability engineers can hang out, swap ideas, ask questions, and help each other level up. You can jump in here: 👉 [https://aka.ms/sreagent/discussions](https://aka.ms/sreagent/discussions)\n\nThis isn’t meant to be a one-way announcement board or a place for polished presentations. It’s a living, breathing discussion space powered by the people using SRE Agent in the real world. Whether you’re just getting started or you’re already pushing limits, there’s value in sharing what you’re learning along the way.\n\nHave a question that you couldn’t find answered in the docs? Ask it. Discovered a neat trick or workaround? Post it. Trying something new and want feedback? Start a thread.\n\nThe hub is only as good as the conversations that happen here—so don’t be shy. Post early, post often, and jump into discussions even if you’re not 100% sure you have the “perfect” answer. Chances are someone else is wondering the same thing, or can build on what you share.\n\nWe especially want this to be a home for **community champions**—people who enjoy helping others, learning out loud, and shaping where this technology goes next. And if you know someone else working with Azure SRE Agent, invite them in. More voices = better conversations.\n\nTo stay up to date on deeper stories, product updates, and real-world use cases, make sure to also follow the blogs: 👉 [http://aka.ms/sreagent/blogs](http://aka.ms/sreagent/blogs)\n\nSee you in the discussions—and welcome to the community 🚀",
