This new skill provides the golden path to deployment—handling framework detection, configuration, local testing, and deployment through natural conversation. Whether you're deploying a marketing site, portfolio, documentation, or a full SPA, what used to take 30+ minutes now takes under 3 minutes.\n\n## From \"Built\" to \"Deployed\" in Minutes\n\nYou've just finished building something great:\n\n- A **marketing landing page** for your startup\n- A **portfolio site** showcasing your work\n- A **documentation site** for your open-source project\n- An **e-commerce storefront** built with Next.js\n- An **internal dashboard** for your team\n- A **blog** with your latest content\n\nNow you want to share it with the world. Azure Static Web Apps offers free hosting, global CDN, custom domains, and built-in auth—but figuring out the deployment workflow can slow you down.\n\n> >\n> **The learning curve:** *\"What's the CLI command again? Is it swa-cli or @azure/static-web-apps-cli? Where does staticwebapp.config.json go?\"*\n> >\n\n> >\n> **The golden path:** *\"Hey Copilot, deploy my Vite app to Azure Static Web Apps\"*\n> >\n\nThe skill provides a streamlined, tested workflow—the golden path—so you can focus on your app, not the deployment process.\n\n## What Are Agent Skills?\n\nAgent Skills are self-contained knowledge bundles that enhance GitHub Copilot's capabilities for specialized tasks. They provide a **curated, golden path** for common workflows:\n\n| Feature | Benefit | | --- | --- | | **Curated Commands** | Exact CLI syntax that works today | | **Guardrails** | Knows what NOT to do (e.g., never manually create swa-cli.config.json) | | **Troubleshooting** | Built-in solutions for common errors | | **Framework Awareness** | Knows Vite uses port 5173, React uses 3000 |\n\n## The Traditional Approach: Learning as You Go\n\nDeploying to Azure Static Web Apps is straightforward once you know the workflow, but the learning curve can add time to your first deployment:\n\n### Typical First-Time Challenges\n\n**Finding the right tools:** Azure has multiple CLI options—the Azure CLI extension (az staticwebapp) for managing resources, and the SWA CLI (@azure/static-web-apps-cli) for local development and deployment. Knowing which to use when takes research.\n\n**Configuration decisions:** Where does staticwebapp.config.json go? Should you use swa init or create configs manually? What's the right build output path for your framework?\n\n**Framework-specific setup:** Different frameworks have different port numbers, build commands, and output directories. Vite uses port 5173, Create React App uses 3000, Next.js has its own conventions.\n\n**SPA routing:** Client-side routing needs navigationFallback configuration—something you might not discover until you see 404 errors in production.\n\n### Typical First Deployment: 25-45 minutes\n\nThis time includes reading documentation, trying commands, and troubleshooting configuration. Not wrong—just a learning process that the skill can accelerate.\n\n## The Golden Path: With the Azure Static Web Apps Skill\n\nThe skill provides a streamlined workflow that guides you through each step—whether you're deploying a portfolio, marketing site, or enterprise application:\n\n### Step 1: Install and Initialize (30 seconds)\n\n``` You: \"Set up my Vite React app for Azure Static Web Apps\"\n\nCopilot (with skill): \"I'll help you set up SWA for your Vite app:\n\n1. Install the CLI:\nnpm install -D @azure/static-web-apps-cli\n\n2. Initialize (auto-detects Vite framework):\nnpx swa init --yes\"\n\nCorrect package, correct command, framework auto-detected! ```\n\n### Step 2: Local Development (15 seconds)\n\n``` You: \"Run it locally\"\n\nCopilot (with skill): \"Start the local emulator: npx swa start\n\nOpen http://localhost:4280 to test.\"\n\nDev server proxy automatically configured! ```\n\n### Step 3: Deploy (30 seconds)\n\n``` You: \"Deploy to Azure\"\n\nCopilot (with skill): \"Deploy to production: npx swa login npx swa deploy --env production\"\n\nCorrect commands AND proactive troubleshooting advice! ```\n\n### Total Time: Under 3 minutes\n\nThe skill provides the golden path—tested commands, framework awareness, and proactive guidance.\n\n## Side-by-Side Comparison\n\n| Task | Learning Curve | Golden Path (with Skill) | | --- | --- | --- | | **Find correct CLI** | Research docs | Instant guidance | | **Create config** | Trial and error | swa init --yes | | **Local dev setup** | Framework research | Auto-detected | | **Deployment** | Documentation reading | Guided workflow | | **Total Time** | **25-45 minutes** | **&lt; 3 minutes** | | **Confidence Level** | Learning | Guided |\n\n## Understanding Azure Static Web Apps Tooling\n\nAzure provides multiple tools for working with Static Web Apps. The skill helps you navigate these options by providing the golden path for each scenario:\n\n### Two Complementary Tools\n\n| Tool | Purpose | Install Command | | --- | --- | --- | | **Azure CLI extension** (az staticwebapp) | Manage Azure resources | Built into Azure CLI | | **SWA CLI** (swa) | Local development, deploying apps | npm install -D [azure](javascript:void%280%29)/static-web-apps-cli |\n\nBoth tools serve important purposes, and the skill guides you to the right one for your task.\n\n### The Skill Provides the Golden Path\n\nThe skill guides you through:\n\n- The right tool for your task\n- The recommended workflow: swa init → swa start → swa deploy\n- Framework detection (Vite, React, Vue, Next.js, and more)\n- Best practices like using swa init for configuration\n\n## What the Skill Knows\n\n### Best Practices Built In\n\n| Best Practice | Why It Matters | | --- | --- | | Use swa init for configuration | Auto-detects framework settings | | Framework-specific ports | Vite uses 5173, React uses 3000, etc. | | navigationFallback for SPAs | Prevents 404s on client-side routes | | platform.apiRuntime for APIs | Required for Azure Functions integration |\n\n### Built-in Troubleshooting\n\n| Common Issue | Skill's Solution | | --- | --- | | 404 on client routes | Add navigationFallback | | API returns 404 | Check apiRuntime and function exports | | Build output not found | Verify output\\_location matches build | | CORS errors | APIs under /api/\\* are same-origin |\n\n## Installing the Skill\n\n### 1.
