Azure Files and Azure File Sync empower IT and devops teams to seamlessly bridge on-premises Windows File Servers with the flexibility and scale of the cloud. With the [latest updates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/azure-file-sync-agent-v22-december-2025-ded35c33-ff9c-4716-8a8d-a080d1bc067b), Azure File Sync is now available in four new regions—bringing data closer to users for regional residency. This release also introduces a modern, identity-driven approach to authentication, providing end to end secure access with managed identities. Azure File Sync now provides simplified onboarding via Azure Arc integrating with the Azure hybrid management experience. With simplified onboarding, secure access and expanding list of regions, Azure File Sync enables organizations to seamlessly expand their hybrid file services, ensuring predictable cost, and scale.\n\n## Simplified deployment with Azure Arc extension\n\nCustomers using [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/overview) managed servers can now easily deploy Azure File Sync using the [Azure Arc extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-extension?tabs=azure-portal). With Azure Arc, customers can simply add the File Sync agent to their servers using a few clicks on portal, or by using an automated workflow with PowerShell, or CLI. The Azure Arc extension model provides a trusted and predictable installation and upgrade experience, with built-in security. Once installed, the Arc extension simplifies Azure File Sync deployments for ARC managed servers.\n\nBeginning January 2026, File Sync will be available at no per‑server cost for customers using Windows Server Software Assurance with Azure Arc and File Sync agent v22 or later. As your environment grows, this reduces the incremental cost of adding servers and reinforces Azure File Sync as a scalable foundation to move your data to Azure.\n\n## Azure File Sync available in 4 new regions\n\nAzure File Sync is now generally available in **Italy North**, **New Zealand North**, **Poland Central**, and **Spain Central**, adding [top requested](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/storage/files/files-whats-new) new geographies to the service. With these additions, customers have even more flexibility to keep data close to users, align with regional mandates and regulatory requirements, and improve performance for regional workloads. This matters especially for customers modernizing branch offices, factories, retail locations, or government sites, where the ability to select a region that is physically close to the workload can be a key part of the storage strategy. As Azure continues to grow, File Sync is growing with it, ensuring that customers can bring hybrid file services wherever their business expands.\n\n## Secure by default with Managed Identities\n\n[Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-managed-identities?tabs=azure-portal)support for Azure File Sync was introduced with v20, to ensure secure end-to-end access by default between the File Sync Server, Storage Sync Service and Azure Files, using Microsoft Entra ID. This reduces security risk of using passwords and operational effort to rotate keys. This means that customers don’t need to configure storage account keys or worry about resetting server certificates when using Azure Files or Azure File Sync. We have now further extended this support to [Managed Identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/files-managed-identities?tabs=windows) for Azure Files SMB.\n\n## Get Started\n\nWhether you are provisioning new storage, expanding to new regions, or modernizing existing deployments, these capabilities provide secure, enterprise-grade access with a streamlined configuration experience.\n\nRefer to the documentation below to get started:\n\n- [Azure Arc integration with Azure File Sync](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-extension?tabs=azure-portal)\n- [Azure File Sync regional availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table)\n- [Managed Identities for File Sync](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-managed-identities?tabs=azure-portal)\n\nFor any questions, please reach out to the team at [azurefiles@microsoft.com](mailto:azurefiles@microsoft.com)\n\nUpdated Jan 16, 2026\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure](/tag/azure?nodeId=board%3AAzureStorageBlog)\n\n[azure file sync](/tag/azure%20file%20sync?nodeId=board%3AAzureStorageBlog)\n\n[azure files](/tag/azure%20files?nodeId=board%3AAzureStorageBlog)\n\n[!\\[grace_kim&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0yOTc3NTgxLVBOdHNFNA?image-coordinates=0%2C93%2C1170%2C1263&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/grace_kim/2977581) [grace_kim](/users/grace_kim/2977581) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined March 31, 2025\n\n[View Profile](/users/grace_kim/2977581)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurestorageblog [Azure Storage Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurestorageblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
