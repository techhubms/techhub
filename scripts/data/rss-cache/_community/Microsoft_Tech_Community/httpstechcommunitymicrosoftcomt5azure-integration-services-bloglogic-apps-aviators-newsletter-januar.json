What are your responsibilities?\n\nI’m a cross-domain Business Solution Architect specializing in delivering new business capabilities to customers. I design end-to-end architectures specially on Azure platforms and also in the Integration domain using azure integration services. My role involves marking architectural decisions, defining standards, ensuring platform reliability, guiding teams, and helping organizations transition from legacy integration systems to modern cloud-native patterns.\n\n##### Can you give us some insights into your day-to-day activities and what a typical day in your role looks like?\n\nMy day usually blends architecture work with hands-on collaboration. I review integration designs, refine patterns, help teams troubleshoot integration flows, and ensure deployments run smoothly through DevOps pipelines. A good part of my time is spent translating business needs into integration patterns and making sure the overall platform stays secure, scalable, and maintainable.\n\n##### What motivates and inspires you to be an active member of the Aviators/Microsoft community?\n\nThe community has shaped a big part of my career. Many of my early breakthroughs came from blogs, samples, and talks shared by others. Contributing back feels like closing the loop. I enjoy sharing real-world lessons, learning from peers, and helping others adopt integration patterns with confidence. The energy of the community and the conversations it creates keep me inspired.\n\n##### Looking back, what advice do you wish you had been given earlier that you'd now share with those looking to get into STEM/technology?\n\nFocus on core concepts—messaging, APIs, security, and distributed systems—because tools evolve, but fundamentals stay relevant. Share your learning early, even if it feels small. Be curious about the “why” behind patterns. Build side projects, not just follow tutorials. And don’t fear a nonlinear career path—diverse experience is an asset in technology.\n\n##### What has helped you grow professionally?\n\nHands-on customer work, strong mentors, and consistent learning habits have been key. Community involvement—writing, speaking, and collaborating—has pushed me to structure my knowledge and stay current. And working in environments that encourage experimentation has helped me develop faster and with more confidence.\n\n##### If you had a magic wand that could create a feature in Logic Apps, what would it be and why?\n\nI’d love to see a unified, out-of-the-box business transaction tracing experience across Logic Apps, Service Bus, APIM, Functions, and downstream services. Something that automatically correlates events, visualizes the full journey of a transaction, and simplifies root-cause analysis. This would make operational troubleshooting dramatically easier in enterprise environments.\n\n# News from our product group\n\n| ![]() | [Microsoft BizTalk Server Product Lifecycle Update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/microsoft-biztalk-server-product-lifecycle-update/4478559)<br><br><br>BizTalk Server 2020 will be the final release, with support extending through 2030. Microsoft encourages a gradual transition to Azure Logic Apps, offering migration tooling, hybrid deployment options, and reuse of existing BizTalk artifacts. Customers can modernize at their own pace while maintaining operational continuity. | | --- | --- | | ![]() | [Data Mapper Test Executor: A New Addition to Logic Apps Standard Test Framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/data-mapper-test-executor-a-new-addition-to-logic-apps-standard-test-framework/4472440)<br><br><br>The Data Mapper Test Executor adds native support for testing XSLT and Data Mapper transformations directly within the Logic Apps Standard test framework. It streamlines validation, improves feedback cycles, and integrates with the latest SDK to enable reliable, automated testing of map generation and execution. | | ![]() | [Announcing General Availability of AI & RAG Connectors in Logic Apps (Standard)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/%F0%9F%8E%89-announcing-general-availability-of-ai--rag-connectors-in-logic-apps-standard/4474337)<br><br><br>Logic Apps Standard AI and RAG connectors are now GA333, enabling native document processing, semantic search, embeddings, and agentic workflows. These capabilities let teams build intelligent, context‑aware automations using their own data, reducing complexity and enhancing decisioning across enterprise integrations. | | ![]() | [Logic Apps Labs](https://azure.github.io/logicapps-labs/docs/category/build-agentic-solutions-with-azure-logic-apps)<br><br><br>The Logic Apps Labs, which introduces Azure Logic Apps agentic workflows learning path, offering guided modules on building conversational and autonomous agents, extending capabilities with MCP tools, and orchestrating multi‑agent workflows. It serves as a starting point for hands‑on labs covering design, deployment, and advanced patterns for intelligent automation. |\n\n#\n\n# News from our community\n\n##### [Handling Empty SQL Query Results in Azure Logic Apps](https://anithasantosh.wordpress.com/2025/12/15/handling-empty-sql-query-results-in-azure-logic-apps/)\n\nPost by [*Anitha Eswaran*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anithaeswaran/)\n\nIf a SQL stored procedure returns no rows, you can detect the empty result set in Logic Apps by checking whether the output’s ResultSets object is {}. When empty, the workflow can be cleanly terminated or used to trigger alerts, ensuring predictable behavior and more resilient integrations.\n\n##### [Azure Logic Apps MCP Server](https://github.com/laveeshb/logicapps-mcp)\n\nPost by [*Laveesh Bansal*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laveeshbansal/)\n\nOur own Laveesh Bansal spent some time creating an Azure Logic Apps MCP Server that enables natural‑language debugging, workflow inspection, and updates without using the portal. It supports both Standard and Consumption apps, integrates with AI clients like Copilot and Claude, and offers tools for local or cloud‑hosted setups, testing, and workflow lifecycle operations.\n\n##### [Azure Logic Apps: Change Detection in JSON Objects and Arrays](https://surajsomani.com/azure-logic-apps-change-detection-in-json-objects-and-arrays)\n\nPost by [Suraj Somani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suraj-somani/)\n\nLogic Apps offers native functions to detect changes in JSON objects and arrays without worrying about field or item order. Using equals() for objects and intersection() for arrays, you can determine when data has truly changed and trigger workflows only when updates occur, improving efficiency and reducing unnecessary processing.\n\n##### [Logic Apps Standard: A clever hack to use JSON schemas in your Artifacts folder for JSON message validation (Part 1)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/logic-apps-standard-clever-hack-use-json-schemas-your-%C5%9Fahin-%C3%B6zdemir-brcde/?trackingId=wY4eA37CTLiRIbNv4Obo8A%3D%3D)\n\nPost by [Şahin Özdemir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%9Fahin-%C3%B6zdemir-2058666/)\n\nŞahin outlines a workaround for using JSON schemas stored in the Artifacts folder to validate messages in Logic Apps Standard. It revisits integration needs from BizTalk migrations and shows how to bring structured validation into modern workflows without relying on Integration Accounts. This is a two part series and [you can find part two here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/logic-apps-standard-clever-hack-apply-json-schema-message-%C3%B6zdemir-pwhge/?trackingId=S5B7dcVoT1CrkWH3OTj9ig%3D%3D).\n\n##### [Let's integrate SAP with Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZuDw_3nBSA)\n\nVideo by [*Sebastian Meyer*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastianmeyerit/)\n\nSebastian has a new video out, and in this episode he and [Martin Pankraz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-pankraz/) break down SAP GROW and RISE for Microsoft integration developers, covering key differences and integration options across IDoc, RFC, BAPI, SOAP, HTTPS, and OData, giving a concise overview of today’s SAP landscape and what it means for building integrations on Azure.\n\n##### [Logic Apps Initialize variables action has a max limit of 20 variables](https://blog.sandro-pereira.com/2025/12/05/friday-fact-logic-apps-initialize-variables-action-has-a-max-limit-of-20-variables/)\n\nPost by [*Sandro Pereira*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandropereira/)\n\nLogic Apps allows only 20 variables per Initialize variables action, and exceeding it triggers a validation error. This limit applies per action, not per workflow. Using objects, parameters, or Compose actions often reduces the need for many scalars and leads to cleaner, more maintainable workflows.
