  "EnhancedContent": "Load testing is most effective when it closely mirrors real-world usage and when test infrastructure is used efficiently.\n\nWe recently launched [AI-assisted load test authoring](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/ai-assisted-load-test-authoring-in-azure-app-testing/4480652) which enables mirroring real-world usage. Today, we are taking another step for the efficient use of test infrastructure. Behind every load test run, there is dedicated infrastructure that needs to be provisioned, managed, and deprovisioned. Low-user or short-lived load test runs lead to inefficient use of test infrastructure. To keep the service cost-effective and ensure judicious use of test infrastructure, we are introducing a minimum usage per test run for load tests in Azure App Testing.\n\nEffective **March 1, 2026**, load tests in Azure App Testing will incur a **minimum Virtual User Hours (VUH)** charge per test run. For each test run, the minimum VUH will be:\n\n- 10 Virtual Users (VUs) per engine for the test run duration, or\n- 10 VUs per engine for 10 minutes, if the test run duration is less than 10 minutes\n\nIf your test run already meets or exceeds this minimum usage, this change doesn’t impact you. Also, this change is only for load tests and does not impact Playwright tests in Azure App Testing.\n\n### **How It Works?**\n\nLet’s make this concrete with a few examples.\n\n#### **Example 1: Low-user, long-duration test**\n\n- **Configuration:** 5 VUs, 1 engine, 3 hours\n- **Actual usage:** 15 VUH = 5 VUs × 3 hours × 1 engine\n- **Minimum usage:** 30 VUH = 10 VUs × 3 hours × 1 engine\n\n**You will be charged for 30 VUH**, since the actual usage is below the minimum.\n\n#### **Example 2: Low-user, short-duration test**\n\n- **Configuration:** 5 VUs, 1 engine, 5 minutes\n- **Actual usage:** 0.83 VUH = 5 VUs × (5 min / 60)\n- **Minimum usage:** 1.67 VUH = 10 VUs × (10 min / 60) × 1 engine\n\n**You will be charged for 1.67 VUH**, since the actual usage is below the minimum.\n\n#### **Example 3: High-user, short-duration test exceeding the minimum**\n\n- **Configuration:** 500 VUs, 2 engines, 5 minutes\n- **Actual usage:** 83.34 VUH = 500 VUs × (5 min / 60) x 2 engines\n- **Minimum usage:** 3.33 VUH = 10 VUs × (10 min / 60) × 2 engines\n\n**You will be charged for 83.34 VUH**, since your usage exceeds the minimum.\n\n### **What should you do?**\n\nBased on usage patterns we’ve observed, some of your test runs may fall below the minimum VUH and could incur a minimum charge. To avoid surprises, we recommend reviewing your test configurations:\n\n- **Low-user, high-engine tests?** Reduce the engine count.\n- **Short-duration or low-user tests?** Increase the user count or duration for meaningful load testing.\n- **Tests above minimum usage?** No action needed!\n\nA small configuration tweak can often make your tests both more effective *and* more cost-efficient.\n\n## **Need Help?**\n\nThe pricing page and pricing calculator will soon be updated to reflect these changes.\n\n- If you have a support plan and need technical assistance, please [create a support request](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpPane.ReactView/callerName/Microsoft_Azure_CloudNativeTesting%2BCreateTestBlade%2B7c71b563-0dc0-4bc0-bcf6-06f8f0516c7a/issueType/quota/assetId/%2Fsubscriptions%2F7c71b563-0dc0-4bc0-bcf6-06f8f0516c7a%2FresourceGroups%2Fdemo-space-rg%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.LoadTestService%2Floadtests%2Fdemo-space/subscriptionId/7c71b563-0dc0-4bc0-bcf6-06f8f0516c7a/productId/06bfd9d3-516b-d5c6-5802-169c800dec89/topicId/1e43cc7f-7ff1-9a9a-2b32-eddc9c67c618/internal_bladeCallId~/1/internal_bladeCallerParams~/%7B%22initialData%22%3A%7B%22v%22%3Anull%2C%22%23fxSerialized%23%22%3Atrue%7D%7D) in the Azure portal.\n- For questions or feedback, share it with the product team on [Developer Community](https://aka.ms/malt-feedback)\n\nHappy load testing that is real-world and efficient!\n\nPublished Jan 29, 2026\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure load testing](/tag/azure%20load%20testing?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[Nikita_Nallamothu&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMjgyNDUxLTM3NTczNmlFNEYxRERGRERCRDg5RjI3?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/nikita_nallamothu/1282451) [Nikita_Nallamothu](/users/nikita_nallamothu/1282451) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined January 20, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/nikita_nallamothu/1282451)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
