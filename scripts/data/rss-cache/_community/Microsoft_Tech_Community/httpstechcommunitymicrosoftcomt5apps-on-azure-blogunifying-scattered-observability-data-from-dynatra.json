  "EnhancedContent": "## What if your deployments could fix themselves?\n\n### The Deployment Remediation Challenge\n\nModern operations teams face a recurring nightmare:\n\n- A deployment ships at 9 AM\n- Errors spike at 9:15 AM\n- By the time you correlate logs, identify the bad revision, and execute a rollback—it's 10:30 AM\n- Your users felt 75 minutes of degraded experience\n\nThe data to detect and fix this existed the entire time—but it was **scattered across clouds and platforms**:\n\n- **Error logs and traces** → Dynatrace (third-party observability cloud)\n- **Deployment history and revisions** → Azure Container Apps API\n- **Resource health and metrics** → Azure Monitor\n- **Rollback commands** → Azure CLI\n\nYour observability data lives in one cloud. Your deployment data lives in another. Stitching together log analysis from Dynatrace with deployment correlation from Azure—and then executing remediation—required a human to manually bridge these silos.\n\nWhat if an AI agent could unify data from third-party observability platforms with Azure deployment history and act on it automatically—every week, before users even notice?\n\n### Enter SRE Agent + Model Context Protocol (MCP) + Subagents\n\nAzure SRE Agent doesn't just work with Azure. Using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, you can connect external observability platforms like Dynatrace directly to your agent. Combined with **subagents** for specialized expertise and **scheduled tasks** for automation, you can build an automated deployment remediation system.\n\nHere's what I built/configured for my Azure Container Apps environment inside SRE Agent:\n\n| **Component** | **Purpose** | | --- | --- | | **Dynatrace MCP Connector** | Connect to Dynatrace's MCP gateway for log queries via DQL | | **'Dynatrace' Subagent** | Log analysis specialist that executes DQL queries and identifies root causes | | **'Remediation' Subagent** | Deployment remediation specialist that correlates errors with deployments and executes rollbacks | | **Scheduled Task** | Weekly Monday 9 AM health check for the 'octopets-prod-api' Container App |\n\n#### Subagent workflow:\n\nThe subagent workflow in SRE Agent Builder: 'OctopetsScheduledTask' triggers 'RemediationSubagent' (12 tools), which hands off to 'DynatraceSubagent' (3 MCP tools) for log analysis.\n\n### How I Set It Up: Step by Step\n\n#### Step 1: Connect Dynatrace via MCP\n\nSRE Agent supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for connecting external data sources. Dynatrace exposes an MCP gateway that provides access to its APIs as first-class tools.\n\n**Connection configuration:**\n\n``` { \"name\": \"dynatrace-mcp-connector\", \"dataConnectorType\": \"Mcp\", \"dataSource\": \"Endpoint=https://<your-tenant>.live.dynatrace.com/platform-reserved/mcp-gateway/v0.1/servers/dynatrace-mcp/mcp;AuthType=BearerToken;BearerToken=<your-api-token>\" } ```\n\nOnce connected, SRE Agent automatically discovers Dynatrace tools.\n\n**💡 Tip:** When creating your Dynatrace API token, grant the `entities.read`, `events.read`, and `metrics.read` scopes for comprehensive access.\n\n#### Step 2: Build Specialized Subagents\n\nGeneric agents are good. Specialized agents are better.\n\nI created **two subagents** that work together in a coordinated workflow—one for Dynatrace log analysis, the other for deployment remediation.\n\n##### DynatraceSubagent\n\nThis subagent is the log analysis specialist. It uses the Dynatrace MCP tools to execute DQL queries and identify root causes.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n\n- Executes DQL queries via MCP tools (`create-dql`, `execute-dql`, `explain-dql`)\n- Fetches 5xx error counts, request volumes, and spike detection\n- Returns consolidated analysis with root cause, affected services, and error patterns\n\n👉 View full *DynatraceSubagent* configuration [here](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/blob/main/samples/proactive-reliability/SubAgents/DynatraceLogAnalysisSubagent.yaml)\n\n##### RemediationSubagent\n\nThis is the deployment remediation specialist. It correlates Dynatrace log analysis with Azure Container Apps deployment history, generates correlation charts, and executes rollbacks when confidence is high.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n\n- Retrieves Container Apps revision history (`GetDeploymentTimes`, `ListRevisions`)\n- Generates correlation charts (`PlotTimeSeriesData`, `PlotBarChart`, `PlotAreaChartWithCorrelation`)\n- Computes confidence score (0-100%) for deployment causation\n- Executes rollback and traffic shift when confidence &gt; 70%\n\n👉 View full *RemediationSubagent* configuration [here](https://github.com/microsoft/sre-agent/blob/main/samples/proactive-reliability/SubAgents/DeploymentRemediationSubagent.yaml)\n\n**The power of specialization:** Each agent focuses on its domain—*DynatraceSubagent* handles log analysis, *RemediationSubagent* handles deployment correlation and rollback. When the workflow runs, *RemediationSubagent* hands off to *DynatraceSubagent* (bi-directional handoff) for analysis, gets the findings back, and continues with remediation. Simple delegation, not a single monolithic agent trying to do everything.\n\n##### Step 3: Create the Weekly Scheduled Task\n\nNow the automation. I configured a scheduled task that runs every Monday at 9:30 AM to check whether deployments in the last 4 hours caused any issues—and automatically remediate if needed.\n\n**Scheduled task configuration:**\n\n| **Setting** | **Value** | | --- | --- | | **Task Name** | OctopetsScheduledTask | | **Frequency** | Weekly | | **Day of Week** | Monday | | **Time** | 9:30 AM | | **Response Subagent** | RemediationSubagent |\n\n**Scheduled Task Configuration**\n\n*Configuring the OctopetsScheduledTask in the SRE Agent portal*\n\n*The key insight:* the scheduled task is just a **coordinator**. It immediately hands off to the *RemediationSubagent*, which orchestrates the entire workflow including handoffs to *DynatraceSubagent*.\n\n##### Step 4: See It In Action\n\nHere's what happens when the scheduled task runs:\n\n**The scheduled task triggering and initiating Dynatrace analysis for octopets-prod-api**\n\nThe *DynatraceSubagent* analyzes the logs and identifies the root cause:\n\n***DynatraceSubagent* executing DQL queries and returning consolidated log analysis**\n\nThe *RemediationSubagent* then generates correlation charts:\n\n**5xx errors spiked after deploying revision 0000039****Error volume isolated to revision 0000039; prior revision 0000038 shows zero errors****5xx error rate correlates strongly with deployment of revision 0000039**\n\nFinally, with a **95% confidence score**, SRE agent executes the rollback *autonomously*:\n\n***RemediationSubagent* executing rollback and traffic shift *autonomously*.**\n\nThe agent detected the bad deployment, generated visual evidence, and automatically shifted 100% traffic to the last known working revision—all without human intervention.\n\n##### Why This Matters\n\n| **Before** | **After** | | --- | --- | | Manually check Dynatrace after incidents | Automated DQL queries via MCP | | Stitch together logs + deployments manually | Subagents correlate data automatically | | Rollback requires human decision + execution | Confidence-based auto-remediation | | 75+ minutes from deployment to rollback | Under 5 Minutes with autonomous workflow | | Reactive incident response | Proactive weekly health checks |\n\n##### Try It Yourself\n\n1. **Connect your observability tool via MCP** (Dynatrace, Datadog, Prometheus—any tool with an MCP gateway)\n2. **Build a log analysis subagent** that knows how to query your observability data\n3. **Build a remediation subagent** that can correlate logs with deployments and execute fixes\n4. **Wire them together with handoffs** so the subagents can delegate log analysis\n5. **Create a scheduled task** to trigger the workflow automatically\n\n#### Learn More\n\n- [Azure SRE Agent documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sre-agent/)\n- [Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sre-agent/custom-mcp-server)\n- [Building subagents for specialized workflows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sre-agent/subagent-builder-overview)\n- [Scheduled tasks and automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sre-agent/scheduled-tasks?tabs=health-check)\n- [SRE Agent Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure/discussions/azure-sre-agent)\n- [Azure SRE Agent pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sre-agent/)\n- [SRE Agent Blogs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/tag/azure%20sre%20agent?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\nUpdated Jan 26, 2026\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure container apps](/tag/azure%20container%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[azure sre agent](/tag/azure%20sre%20agent?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[best practices](/tag/best%20practices?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[cloud native](/tag/cloud%20native?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[devops](/tag/devops?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[serverless](/tag/serverless?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[Vineela-Suri&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-12.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/vineela-suri/2749548) [Vineela-Suri](/users/vineela-suri/2749548) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined November 06, 2024\n\n[View Profile](/users/vineela-suri/2749548)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
