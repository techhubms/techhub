  "EnhancedContent": "## Azure API Management enforces various limits on resources such as API operations and other entities. We are announcing new limits across these entities for classic and v2 tiers.\n\nAzure API Management operates on finite physical infrastructure. To ensure reliable performance for all customers, the service enforces limits calibrated based on:\n\n- Azure platform capacity and performance characteristics\n- Service tier capabilities\n- Typical customer usage patterns\n\nResource limits are interrelated and tuned to prevent any single aspect from disrupting overall service performance.\n\n## Changes to service limits - 2026 update\n\nStarting March 2026 and over the following several months, Azure API Management is introducing updated resource limits for instances across all tiers. The limits are shown in the following table.\n\n| Entity/Resource | Consumption | Developer | Basic/<br>Basic v2 | Standard/<br>Standard v2 | Premium/<br>Premium v2 | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | API operations | 3,000 | 3,000 | 10,000 | 50,000 | 75,000 | | API tags | 1,500 | 1,500 | 1,500 | 2,500 | 15,000 | | Named values | 5,000 | 5,000 | 5,000 | 10,000 | 18,000 | | Loggers | 100 | 100 | 100 | 200 | 400 | | Products | 100 | 100 | 200 | 500 | 2,000 | | Subscriptions | N/A | 10,000 | 15,000 | 25,000 | 75,000 | | Users | N/A | 20,000 | 20,000 | 50,000 | 75,000 | | Workspaces per workspace gateway | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 30 | | Self-hosted gateways | N/A | 5 | N/A | N/A | 1001 |\n\n1 Applies to Premium tier only.\n\n### What's changing\n\n- Limits in the classic tiers now align with those set in the v2 tiers.\n- Limits are enforced for a smaller set of resource types that are directly related to service capacity and performance, such as API operations, tags, products, and subscriptions.\n\n### Rollout process\n\nNew limits roll out in a phased approach by tier as follows:\n\n| Tier | Expected rollout date | | --- | --- | | Consumption<br>Developer<br>Basic<br>Basic v2 | March 15, 2026 | | Standard<br>Standard v2 | April 15, 2026 | | Premium<br>Premium v2 | May 15, 2026 |\n\n### Limits policy for existing classic tier customers\n\nAfter the new limits take effect, you can continue using your preexisting API Management resources without interruption.\n\n- Existing classic tier services, where current usage exceeds the new limits, are \"grandfathered\" when the new limits are introduced. (Instances in the v2 tiers are already subject to the new limits.)\n- Limits in grandfathered services will be set 10% higher than the customer's observed usage at the time new limits take effect.\n- Grandfathering applies per service and service tier.\n- Other existing services and new services are subject to the new limits when they take effect.\n\n## Guidelines for limit increases\n\nIn some cases, you might want to increase a service limit. Before requesting a limit increase, note the following guidelines:\n\n- Explore strategies to address the issue proactively before requesting a limit increase. See the article here [Manage resources within limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/service-limits#strategies-to-manage-resources).\n- Consider potential impacts of the limit increase on overall service performance and stability. Increasing a limit might affect your service's capacity or increase latency in some service operations.\n\n### Requesting a limit increase\n\nThe product team considers requests for limit increases only for customers using services in the following tiers that are designed for medium to large production workloads:\n\n- Standard and Standard v2\n- Premium and Premium v2\n\nRequests for limit increases are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and aren't guaranteed. The product team prioritizes Premium and Premium v2 tier customers for limit increases.\n\nTo request a limit increase, create a support request from the Azure portal.
