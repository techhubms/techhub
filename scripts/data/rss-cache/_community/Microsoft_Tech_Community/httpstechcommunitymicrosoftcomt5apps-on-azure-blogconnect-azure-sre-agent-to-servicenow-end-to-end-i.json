  "Description": "## 🎯 What You'll Achieve\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll:\n\n1. Connect Azure SRE Agent to ServiceNow as your incident management platform\n2. Create a test incident in ServiceNow\n3. Watch the AI agent automatically pick up, investigate, and resolve the incident\n4. See the agent write triage findings and resolution notes back to ServiceNow\n\n**Time to complete:** ~10 minutes\n\n## 🎬 The End Result\n\nBefore we dive in, here's what the end result looks like:\n\n### ServiceNow Incident - Resolved by Azure SRE Agent\n\n![]()\n\nThe Azure SRE Agent:\n\n- ✅ Detected the incident from ServiceNow\n- ✅ Acknowledged and began triage automatically\n- ✅ Investigated AKS cluster memory utilization\n- ✅ Documented findings in work notes\n- ✅ Resolved the incident with detailed root cause analysis\n\n## 📋 Prerequisites\n\n- A ServiceNow instance (Developer, PDI, or Enterprise)\n- Administrator access to ServiceNow\n- An Azure SRE Agent deployed in your Azure subscription\n\n> >\n> 💡 **Don't have a ServiceNow instance?** Get a free Personal Developer Instance (PDI) at [developer.servicenow.com](https://developer.servicenow.com)\n> >\n\n## 🔧 Step 1: Gather Your ServiceNow Credentials\n\nTo connect Azure SRE Agent to ServiceNow, you need three pieces of information:\n\n| Component | Where to Find It | | --- | --- | | **ServiceNow Endpoint** | Browser address bar when logged into ServiceNow (format: `https://your-instance.service-now.com`<br>) | | **Username** | Click your profile avatar → Profile → User ID | | **Password** | Your ServiceNow login password |\n\n### Finding Your Instance URL\n\nYour ServiceNow instance URL is visible in your browser's address bar when logged in:\n\n``` https://{your-instance-name}.service-now.com ```\n\n### Finding Your Username\n\n1. Click your **profile avatar** in the top-right corner of ServiceNow\n2. Click **Profile**\n3. Your **User ID** is your username\n\n## ⚙️ Step 2: Connect SRE Agent to ServiceNow\n\n### Navigate to Your SRE Agent\n\n1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)\n2. Search for **\"Azure SRE Agent\"** in the search bar\n3. Click on **Azure SRE Agent (Preview)** in the results\n4. Select your agent from the list\n\n### Configure the Incident Platform\n\n1. In the left navigation, expand **Settings**\n2. Click **Incident platform**\n3. Click the **Incident platform** dropdown\n4. Select **ServiceNow**\n\nHere's what the ServiceNow configuration form looks like:\n\n![]()\n\n### Enter Your ServiceNow Credentials\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **ServiceNow endpoint** | Your ServiceNow instance URL (from Step 1) | | **Username** | Your ServiceNow username (from Step 1) | | **Password** | Your ServiceNow password | | **Quickstart response plan** | ✓ Enable this for automatic investigation |\n\n### Save and Verify\n\n1. Click the **Save** button\n2. Wait for validation to complete\n3. Look for: **\"ServiceNow is connected.\"** with a green checkmark\n\n## 🚨 Step 3: Create a Test Incident in ServiceNow\n\nNow let's test the integration by creating an incident in ServiceNow.\n\n### Navigate to Create Incident\n\n1. In ServiceNow, click **All** in the left navigation\n2. Search for **\"Incident\"**\n3. Click **Incident → Create New**\n\n### Fill in the Incident Details\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Caller** | Select any user (e.g., System Administrator) | | **Short description** | [SRE Agent Test] AKS Cluster memory pressure detected in production environment | | **Impact** | 2 - Medium |\n\n### Submit the Incident\n\nClick **Submit** to create the incident. Note the incident number that's assigned.\n\n## 🤖 Step 4: Watch SRE Agent Investigate\n\n### Check the SRE Agent Portal\n\n1. Return to the Azure Portal\n2. Open your SRE Agent\n3. Click **Activities → Incidents**\n\nWithin seconds, you should see your ServiceNow incident appear!\n\n![]()\n\n### Observe the Autonomous Investigation\n\nClick on the incident to see the SRE Agent's investigation in action:\n\n**The agent automatically:**\n\n1. 🔔 **Acknowledged** the incident\n2. 📋 **Created a triage plan** with clear steps\n3. 🔍 **Identified** AKS clusters in your subscription\n4. 📊 **Validated** memory utilization metrics\n5. ✅ **Resolved** the incident with findings\n\n## 📝 Step 5: Review Resolution in ServiceNow\n\n### Check the ServiceNow Incident\n\nReturn to ServiceNow and open your incident. You'll see:\n\n1. **State:** Changed to **Resolved**\n2. **Activity Stream:** Multiple work notes from the agent\n3. **Resolution notes:** Detailed findings\n\n### Resolution Notes\n\nThe agent writes comprehensive resolution notes including:\n\n- Timestamp of resolution\n- Root cause analysis\n- Validation steps performed\n- Fix applied (if any)\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n\n- Create custom response plans to customize how the agent responds to different incident types\n- Configure alert routing to route specific Azure Monitor alerts to the agent\n- Explore the Azure SRE Agent documentation for more features\n\n*Have questions?
