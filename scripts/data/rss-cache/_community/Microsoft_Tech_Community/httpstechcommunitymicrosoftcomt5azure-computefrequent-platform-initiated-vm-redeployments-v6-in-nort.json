The Service Health notifications usually mention that the host OS became unresponsive and that there is a low-level issue between the host operating system and firmware. The VM is then started on a different host as part of the auto-recovery process.\n\nThere is no corresponding public Azure Status incident for North Europe when this occurs. From the guest OS perspective, there are no warning signs beforehand such as high CPU or memory usage, kernel errors, or planned maintenance events.\n\nThis behavior looks like a host or hardware stamp issue, but the frequency is concerning.\n\nHas anyone else running v6 virtual machines in North Europe observed similar unplanned redeployments? Has Microsoft shared any statements or acknowledgements regarding ongoing host or firmware stability issues for this region or SKU? If you worked with Azure Support on this, were you told this was cluster-specific or related to a particular hardware stamp?\n\nWe are already engaging Azure Support, but I wanted to check whether this is an isolated case or something others are also encountering.\n\nThanks in advance for any insights or shared experiences.",
