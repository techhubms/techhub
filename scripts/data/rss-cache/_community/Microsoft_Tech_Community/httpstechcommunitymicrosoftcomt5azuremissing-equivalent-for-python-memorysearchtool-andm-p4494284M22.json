  "EnhancedContent": "Hi Team,\n\nI am currently working with the **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service (preview)**. I’ve been reviewing the documentation for managed long-term memory, specifically the \"Automatic User Memory\" features demonstrated in the Python SDK here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/memory-usage?view=foundry&tabs=python.\n\nIn Python, it is very straightforward to attach a MemorySearchTool to an agent and use *AgentMemorySettings(scope=\"user\\_123\")* during a run. This allows the service to automatically extract, consolidate, and retrieve memories without manual intervention.\n\nHowever, in the https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/ai/Azure.AI.Projects#memory-store-operations, I only see the low-level *MemoryStoreClient* which appears to require manual CRUD operations on memory items.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1. Is there an equivalent high-level AgentMemorySearchTool or similar abstraction in the current C# NuGet package (Azure.AI.Projects) that handles automatic extraction and retrieval?\n2. If not currently available, is this feature on the immediate roadmap for the .NET SDK?\n3. Are there any samples showing how to achieve \"automatic\" memory (where the Agent extracts facts itself) using the C# SDK without having to build a custom orchestration layer or call REST APIs directly?\n\nAny guidance on the timeline for feature parity between the Python and .NET SDKs regarding Agent Memory would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**SDK Version**: Azure.AI.Projects 1.2.0-beta.5",
