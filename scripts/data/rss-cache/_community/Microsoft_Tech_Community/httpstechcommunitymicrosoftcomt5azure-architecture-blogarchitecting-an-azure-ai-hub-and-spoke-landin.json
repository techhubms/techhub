  "Description": "A large enterprise customer adopting AI at scale typically needs three non‑negotiables in its AI foundation:\n\n1. **End‑to‑end tenant isolation** across network, identity, compute, and data\n2. **Secure, governed traffic flow** from users to AI services\n3. **Transparent chargeback/showback** for shared AI and platform services\n\nAt the same time, the platform must enable rapid onboarding of new tenants or applications and scale cleanly from proof‑of‑concept to production.\n\nThis article proposes an **Azure Landing Zone–aligned** architecture using a **Hub‑and‑Spoke** model, where:\n\n- The **AI Hub** centralizes shared services and governance\n- **AI Spokes** host tenant‑dedicated AI resources\n- **Application logic and AI agents run on AKS**\n\nThe result is a secure, scalable, and operationally efficient enterprise AI foundation.\n\n## 1. Architecture goals & design principles\n\n### Goals\n\n- Host **application logic and AI agents on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**\n- Enforce **strong tenant isolation** across all layers\n- Support **cross chargeback** and cost attribution\n- Adopt a **Hub‑and‑Spoke** model with clear separation of shared vs. tenant‑specific services\n\n### Design principles (Azure Landing Zone aligned)\n\nAzure Landing Zone (ALZ) guidance emphasizes:\n\n- Separation of **platform** and **workload** subscriptions\n- Management groups and policy inheritance\n- Centralized connectivity using hub‑and‑spoke networking\n- Policy‑driven governance and automation\n\nFor infrastructure as code, ALZ‑aligned deployments typically use **Bicep or Terraform**, increasingly leveraging **Azure Verified Modules (AVM)** for consistency and long‑term maintainability.\n\n## 2. Subscription & management group model\n\nA practical enterprise layout looks like this:\n\n- **Tenant Root Management Group**\n\no **Platform Management Group**\n\n- Connectivity subscription (Hub VNet, Firewall, DNS, ExpressRoute/VPN)\n- Management subscription (Log Analytics, Monitor)\n- Security subscription (Defender for Cloud, Sentinel if required)\n\no **AI Hub Management Group**\n\n- AI Hub subscription (shared AI and governance services)\n\no **AI Spokes Management Group**\n\n- One subscription per tenant, business unit, or regulated boundary\n\nThis structure supports enterprise‑scale governance while allowing teams to operate independently within well‑defined guardrails.\n\n## 3. Logical architecture — AI Hub vs. AI Spoke\n\n### AI Hub (central/shared services)\n\nThe AI Hub acts as the **governed control plane** for AI consumption:\n\n- **Ingress & edge security**: Azure Application Gateway with WAF (or Front Door for global scenarios)\n- **Central egress control**: Azure Firewall with forced tunneling\n- **API governance**: Azure API Management (private/internal mode)\n- **Shared AI services**: Azure OpenAI (shared deployments where appropriate), safety controls\n- **Monitoring & observability**: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, centralized dashboards\n- **Governance**: Azure Policy, RBAC, naming and tagging standards\n\nAll tenant traffic enters through the hub, ensuring consistent enforcement of security, identity, and usage policies.\n\n### AI Spoke (tenant‑dedicated services)\n\nEach AI Spoke provides a **tenant‑isolated data and execution plane**:\n\n- Tenant‑dedicated storage accounts and databases\n- Vector stores and retrieval systems (Azure AI Search with isolated indexes or services)\n- AKS runtime for tenant‑specific AI agents and backend services\n- Tenant‑scoped keys, secrets, and identities\n\n## 4.

  "EnhancedContent": "## As enterprises adopt generative AI at scale, designing a platform that balances shared services, tenant isolation, and cost transparency becomes critical. In many real-world scenarios, organizations need a standalone AI platform that delivers immediate value without relying on a fully established enterprise landing zone.\n\nThis blog draws from experience designing an Azure AI Hub and Spoke architecture for a multi-tenant enterprise customer. The solution uses a shared AI Hub to host common capabilities—Application Gateway, Azure Firewall, API Management, shared AKS, Azure AI Search, and LLM models via Azure AI Foundry—while serving dedicated customers through isolated AI Spokes.\n\nCustomer-specific application logic is deployed on AKS and consumes shared AI services securely, enabling reuse, isolation, and usage-based chargeback without duplicating infrastructure. The AI Hub itself contains the required network and AI components, allowing the platform to operate independently of a traditional landing zone.\n\nThe sections below outline the key architectural choices, isolation approach, and cost considerations involved in building a scalable, enterprise-grade Azure AI platform.\n\nA large enterprise customer adopting AI at scale typically needs three non‑negotiables in its AI foundation:\n\n1. **End‑to‑end tenant isolation** across network, identity, compute, and data\n2. **Secure, governed traffic flow** from users to AI services\n3. **Transparent chargeback/showback** for shared AI and platform services\n\nAt the same time, the platform must enable rapid onboarding of new tenants or applications and scale cleanly from proof‑of‑concept to production.\n\nThis article proposes an **Azure Landing Zone–aligned** architecture using a **Hub‑and‑Spoke** model, where:\n\n- The **AI Hub** centralizes shared services and governance\n- **AI Spokes** host tenant‑dedicated AI resources\n- **Application logic and AI agents run on AKS**\n\nThe result is a secure, scalable, and operationally efficient enterprise AI foundation.\n\n## 1.
