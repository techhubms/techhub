At the application level, operational health is tracked via response times, error rates, and successful operations to detect software-level problems rapidly.\n\n1. **Diagnosis**\n\nOnce detected, lightweight diagnostics determine the best recovery action without unnecessary delays. Diagnostics operates at multiple levels; host level checks asses underlying infrastructure, VM level diagnostics evaluate the virtual machine state and system-on-chip (SoC) level analysis examines hardware components. This includes network checks, resource utilization assessments, and service responsiveness tests. Detailed data is also collected for post-incident analysis, continuously improving diagnostic algorithms while active recovery proceeds.\n\n1. **Mitigation**\n\nBased on diagnostics, the system automatically executes the optimal recovery strategy, starting with the least disruptive methods and escalating as needed. Hardware failures may trigger VM migration, while software issues might be resolved with targeted service restarts. If needed, a host reset is performed while preserving virtual machine state, ensuring minimal disruption to running workloads. Post-mitigation health checks ensure full VM functionality before recovery is considered complete.\n\n![]()\n\n## Recovery Event Annotations\n\nRecovery Event Annotations are specialized annotations that provide detailed visibility into every stage of VM recovery, going beyond simple uptime metrics. These indicators act as custom monitoring metrics, breaking down each incident into precise time segments. For example, TTD (Time to Detect) measures the time between a VM becoming unhealthy and the system recognizing the issue, while TTDiag (Time to Diagnose) tracks the duration of diagnostic checks. By analyzing these segments, Recovery Timing Indicators help identify bottlenecks, optimize recovery steps, and improve overall reliability. Key benefits include:\n\n- Understanding why some VMs recover faster than others.\n- Identifying which diagnostics add value versus those that don’t.\n- Highlighting opportunities that provide a faster path of recovery.\n- Enabling early detection of regressions through event annotation-driven alerts.\n- Establishing a common language across Azure teams for measuring and improving downtime.\n\n## Customer Impact and Results\n\nAzure Automated VM Recovery demonstrates our commitment to not only high availability but also rapid recovery. By minimizing downtime, it helps customers build resilient applications and maintain business continuity during unexpected failures. Over the past 18 months, this solution has cut average VM downtime by more than half, significantly enhancing reliability and customer experience. Our ongoing goal is to provide a platform where customers can deploy workloads with confidence, knowing automated recovery will minimize disruptions.",
