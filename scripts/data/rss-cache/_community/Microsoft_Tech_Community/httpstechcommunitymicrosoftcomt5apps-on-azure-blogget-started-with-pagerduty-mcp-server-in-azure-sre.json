  "Description": "# Get started with PagerDuty MCP server in Azure SRE Agent\n\nConnect Azure SRE Agent to PagerDuty's incident management platform using the official PagerDuty MCP server for incidents, on-call schedules, services, escalation policies, and more.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe PagerDuty MCP server is a cloud-hosted bridge between your PagerDuty account and Azure SRE Agent. Once configured, it enables real-time interaction with incidents, on-call schedules, services, teams, escalation policies, event orchestration, incident workflows, status pages, and more through natural language. All actions respect the permissions of the user account associated with the API token.\n\nThe server uses **Streamable HTTP** transport with a single `Authorization` custom header for authentication. Azure SRE Agent connects directly to the PagerDuty-hosted endpoint—no npm packages, local proxies, or container deployments are required. Since there is no dedicated PagerDuty connector type in the portal, you use the generic **MCP server** (User provided connector) option and configure the authorization header manually.\n\n### Key capabilities\n\n| Area | Capabilities | | --- | --- | | **Incidents** | Create, list, manage incidents; add notes, responders; view alerts; find related/outlier/past incidents | | **Services** | Create, list, update, and get service details | | **On-Call & Schedules** | List on-calls, manage schedules, create overrides, list schedule users | | **Escalation Policies** | List and get escalation policy details | | **Teams & Users** | Create, update, delete teams; manage team members; list and get user data | | **Alert Grouping** | Create, update, delete, and list alert grouping settings | | **Change Events** | List and get change events by service or incident | | **Event Orchestration** | Manage event orchestration routers, global rules, and service rules | | **Incident Workflows** | List, get, and start incident workflows | | **Log Entries** | List and get log entry details | | **Status Pages** | Create and manage status page posts, updates, impacts, and severities |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is the official PagerDuty-hosted MCP server. It exposes **60+ tools** covering incidents, services, on-call, escalation, event orchestration, incident workflows, status pages, and more. The hosted service at `mcp.pagerduty.com`\n> exposes all tools (both read and write) by default. Tool availability depends on your PagerDuty plan and user account permissions.\n> >\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Azure SRE Agent resource deployed in Azure\n- PagerDuty account with an active plan\n- PagerDuty user account with appropriate permissions\n- **User API Token**: Created from User Profile > User Settings > API Access\n\n## Step 1: Create a PagerDuty API token\n\nGenerate the User API Token needed to authenticate with the PagerDuty MCP server. PagerDuty uses a single token for both authentication and authorization—the token inherits all permissions of the user account that creates it.\n\n### Navigate to API Access in PagerDuty\n\n1. Log in to your [PagerDuty account](https://app.pagerduty.com/)\n2. For EU accounts, use `https://app.eu.pagerduty.com/`\n3. Select your **user avatar** in the top-right corner of the navigation bar\n4. Select **My Profile** from the dropdown menu\n5. Select the **User Settings** tab at the top of your profile page\n6. Scroll down to the **API Access** section\n\n### Create a User API Token\n\n1. In the **API Access** section, select **Create API User Token**\n2. Enter a descriptive name for the token (e.g., `sre-agent-mcp`\n)\n3. Select **Create Token**\n4. **Copy the token value immediately**—it is displayed only once and cannot be retrieved later\n\nThe token format will look like: `u+xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Store the API token securely. If you lose it, you must delete the old token and create a new one. Navigate back to **My Profile** > **User Settings** > **API Access** to manage your tokens.\n> >\n\n### Choose the right account for token creation\n\nThe API token inherits all permissions of the PagerDuty user account that creates it. Consider these options:\n\n| Account type | When to use | Permissions | | --- | --- | --- | | **Personal account** | Quick testing and development | Full permissions of your user role | | **Service account** (recommended for production) | Production deployments | Create a dedicated PagerDuty user with a restricted role | | **Read-only account** | Monitoring-only use cases | Create a user with the **Observer** or **Restricted Access** role |\n\n> >\n> [!TIP]\n> For production use, create a dedicated PagerDuty user with a **Responder** or **Observer** role (depending on whether write access is needed), then generate the token from that account. This ensures the integration continues to work if team members leave the organization and limits the blast radius of a compromised token.\n> > >\n> [!NOTE]\n> PagerDuty also supports **Account-level API keys** (created under **Integrations** > **Developer Tools** > **API Access Keys**), but the MCP server requires a **User API Token**, not an account-level key.\n> >\n\n## Step 2: Add the MCP connector\n\nConnect the PagerDuty MCP server to your SRE Agent using the portal. Since there is no dedicated PagerDuty connector type, you use the generic **MCP server** (User provided connector) option.\n\n### Determine your regional endpoint\n\nSelect the endpoint URL that matches your PagerDuty account's service region:\n\n| Region | Endpoint URL | | --- | --- | | **US** (default) | `https://mcp.pagerduty.com/mcp` | | **EU** | `https://mcp.eu.pagerduty.com/mcp` |\n\n### Using the Azure portal\n\n1. In Azure portal, navigate to your SRE Agent resource\n2. Select **Builder** > **Connectors**\n3. Select **Add connector**\n4. Select **MCP server** (User provided connector) and select **Next**\n\n![Select ](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/pagerduty-02-select-connector.png)\n\n1. Configure the connector:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Name** | `pagerduty-mcp` | | **Connection type** | Streamable-HTTP | | **URL** | `https://mcp.pagerduty.com/mcp`<br> (use EU endpoint for EU service region) | | **Authentication** | Custom headers | | **Authorization** | `Token ` |\n\n1. Select **Next** to review\n\n![Configure the PagerDuty MCP connector with the endpoint URL and Authorization header using Token authentication](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/pagerduty-03-config-form.png)\n\n1. Select **Add connector**\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The token format in the `Authorization`\n> header must be `Token `\n> (not `Bearer`\n> ). For example: `Token u+abcdefg123456789`\n> . Using the wrong format will result in `401 Unauthorized`\n> errors.\n> > >\n> [!NOTE]\n> Once the connector shows **Connected** status, the PagerDuty MCP tools are automatically available to your agent. You can verify by checking the tools list in the connector details.\n> >\n\n![Connectors list showing pagerduty-mcp with Connected status](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/pagerduty-01-connectors-list.png)\n\n## Step 3: Create a PagerDuty subagent (optional)\n\nCreate a specialized subagent to give the AI focused PagerDuty incident management expertise and better prompt responses.\n\n1. Navigate to **Builder** > **Subagents**\n2. Select **Add subagent**\n3.

The self-hosted server exposes only read-only tools by default; write tools require the `--enable-write-tools`\n> flag at startup. For Azure SRE Agent, the hosted service at `mcp.pagerduty.com`\n> is recommended as it requires no infrastructure management and exposes all tools automatically.\n> >\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Authentication issues\n\n| Error | Cause | Solution | | --- | --- | --- | | `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid or expired API token | Verify the token is correct and active in User Settings > API Access | | `403 Forbidden` | Insufficient user permissions | Ensure the user account associated with the token has the required PagerDuty role | | Connection refused | Firewall blocking outbound HTTPS | Verify firewall allows HTTPS traffic to `mcp.pagerduty.com`<br> (port 443) | | Token format error | Using `Bearer`<br> instead of `Token` | The `Authorization`<br> header must use `Token `<br> format, not `Bearer ` |\n\n### Data and permission issues\n\n| Error | Cause | Solution | | --- | --- | --- | | No data returned | Token user lacks access to the resource | Verify the user account has access to the requested services, teams, or incidents | | EU region errors | Using US endpoint for EU account | Switch the connector URL to `https://mcp.eu.pagerduty.com/mcp` | | Write operation failed | User lacks write permissions | Verify the token's user account has a role that allows write operations (e.g., Manager, Admin) | | Rate limit exceeded | Too many API requests | PagerDuty rate limits vary by plan; reduce request frequency or contact PagerDuty support | | Incident not found | Wrong incident ID or no access | Verify the incident ID and that the token's user has access to the incident's service |\n\n### Verify the connection\n\nTest the server endpoint directly:\n\n``` curl -I \"https://mcp.pagerduty.com/mcp\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Token \"\n\n```\n\nExpected response: `200 OK` confirms authentication is working.\n\n### Re-authorize the integration\n\nIf you encounter persistent issues:\n\n1. Navigate to **My Profile** > **User Settings** > **API Access** in PagerDuty\n2. Delete the existing API User Token\n3. Create a new API User Token\n4. Update the connector in the SRE Agent portal with the new token value in the `Authorization`\nheader (format: `Token ` )\n\n## Limitations\n\n| Limitation | Details | | --- | --- | | **User-scoped permissions** | API token permissions are tied to the creating user's account; the token cannot exceed the user's access level | | **Self-hosted write restriction** | The self-hosted MCP server only exposes read-only tools by default; write tools require the `--enable-write-tools`<br> flag | | **Rate limits** | API rate limits apply per your PagerDuty plan; high-frequency usage may be throttled | | **No dedicated connector type** | The portal does not have a dedicated PagerDuty connector; you must use the generic MCP server connector and configure headers manually | | **Two regional endpoints only** | Only US and EU service regions are supported; the endpoint must match your account's service region | | **Token rotation** | API tokens do not automatically expire; manual rotation is recommended as a security best practice |\n\n## Security considerations\n\n### How permissions work\n\n- **User-scoped**: All actions respect the permissions of the PagerDuty user account that created the API token\n- **Token-based**: A single User API Token in the `Authorization`\nheader provides both authentication and authorization\n- **Role-based**: The token inherits the PagerDuty role (Observer, Responder, Manager, Admin, etc.) of the creating user\n\n### Data security\n\n- All traffic encrypted via HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)\n- User API tokens authenticate both the account and the user's permission scope\n- API usage can be monitored via PagerDuty audit logs\n\n### Admin controls\n\nPagerDuty administrators can:\n- Create and revoke User API tokens from user profile settings\n- Assign roles to user accounts to control permission scope\n- Use service accounts with restricted roles to limit the blast radius of compromised tokens\n- Monitor API token usage through PagerDuty's audit logs\n- Enforce token rotation policies as part of security governance\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> PagerDuty User API tokens can read and modify sensitive operational data including incidents, on-call schedules, and service configurations. Use service account tokens with restricted roles, grant only the permissions your agent needs, and rotate tokens regularly.

  "EnhancedContent": "# Get started with PagerDuty MCP server in Azure SRE Agent\n\nConnect Azure SRE Agent to PagerDuty's incident management platform using the official PagerDuty MCP server for incidents, on-call schedules, services, escalation policies, and more.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe PagerDuty MCP server is a cloud-hosted bridge between your PagerDuty account and Azure SRE Agent. Once configured, it enables real-time interaction with incidents, on-call schedules, services, teams, escalation policies, event orchestration, incident workflows, status pages, and more through natural language. All actions respect the permissions of the user account associated with the API token.\n\nThe server uses **Streamable HTTP** transport with a single `Authorization` custom header for authentication. Azure SRE Agent connects directly to the PagerDuty-hosted endpoint—no npm packages, local proxies, or container deployments are required. Since there is no dedicated PagerDuty connector type in the portal, you use the generic **MCP server** (User provided connector) option and configure the authorization header manually.\n\n### Key capabilities\n\n| Area | Capabilities | | --- | --- | | **Incidents** | Create, list, manage incidents; add notes, responders; view alerts; find related/outlier/past incidents | | **Services** | Create, list, update, and get service details | | **On-Call & Schedules** | List on-calls, manage schedules, create overrides, list schedule users | | **Escalation Policies** | List and get escalation policy details | | **Teams & Users** | Create, update, delete teams; manage team members; list and get user data | | **Alert Grouping** | Create, update, delete, and list alert grouping settings | | **Change Events** | List and get change events by service or incident | | **Event Orchestration** | Manage event orchestration routers, global rules, and service rules | | **Incident Workflows** | List, get, and start incident workflows | | **Log Entries** | List and get log entry details | | **Status Pages** | Create and manage status page posts, updates, impacts, and severities |\n\n> >\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is the official PagerDuty-hosted MCP server. It exposes **60+ tools** covering incidents, services, on-call, escalation, event orchestration, incident workflows, status pages, and more. The hosted service at `mcp.pagerduty.com`\n> exposes all tools (both read and write) by default. Tool availability depends on your PagerDuty plan and user account permissions.\n> >\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Azure SRE Agent resource deployed in Azure\n- PagerDuty account with an active plan\n- PagerDuty user account with appropriate permissions\n- **User API Token**: Created from User Profile &gt; User Settings &gt; API Access\n\n## Step 1: Create a PagerDuty API token\n\nGenerate the User API Token needed to authenticate with the PagerDuty MCP server. PagerDuty uses a single token for both authentication and authorization—the token inherits all permissions of the user account that creates it.\n\n### Navigate to API Access in PagerDuty\n\n1. Log in to your [PagerDuty account](https://app.pagerduty.com/)\n2. For EU accounts, use `https://app.eu.pagerduty.com/`\n3. Select your **user avatar** in the top-right corner of the navigation bar\n4. Select **My Profile** from the dropdown menu\n5. Select the **User Settings** tab at the top of your profile page\n6. Scroll down to the **API Access** section\n\n### Create a User API Token\n\n1. In the **API Access** section, select **Create API User Token**\n2. Enter a descriptive name for the token (e.g., `sre-agent-mcp`\n)\n3. Select **Create Token**\n4. **Copy the token value immediately**—it is displayed only once and cannot be retrieved later\n\nThe token format will look like: `u+xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Store the API token securely. If you lose it, you must delete the old token and create a new one. Navigate back to **My Profile** &gt; **User Settings** &gt; **API Access** to manage your tokens.\n> >\n\n### Choose the right account for token creation\n\nThe API token inherits all permissions of the PagerDuty user account that creates it. Consider these options:\n\n| Account type | When to use | Permissions | | --- | --- | --- | | **Personal account** | Quick testing and development | Full permissions of your user role | | **Service account** (recommended for production) | Production deployments | Create a dedicated PagerDuty user with a restricted role | | **Read-only account** | Monitoring-only use cases | Create a user with the **Observer** or **Restricted Access** role |\n\n> >\n> [!TIP]\n> For production use, create a dedicated PagerDuty user with a **Responder** or **Observer** role (depending on whether write access is needed), then generate the token from that account. This ensures the integration continues to work if team members leave the organization and limits the blast radius of a compromised token.\n> > >\n> [!NOTE]\n> PagerDuty also supports **Account-level API keys** (created under **Integrations** &gt; **Developer Tools** &gt; **API Access Keys**), but the MCP server requires a **User API Token**, not an account-level key.\n> >\n\n## Step 2: Add the MCP connector\n\nConnect the PagerDuty MCP server to your SRE Agent using the portal. Since there is no dedicated PagerDuty connector type, you use the generic **MCP server** (User provided connector) option.\n\n### Determine your regional endpoint\n\nSelect the endpoint URL that matches your PagerDuty account's service region:\n\n| Region | Endpoint URL | | --- | --- | | **US** (default) | `https://mcp.pagerduty.com/mcp` | | **EU** | `https://mcp.eu.pagerduty.com/mcp` |\n\n### Using the Azure portal\n\n1. In Azure portal, navigate to your SRE Agent resource\n2. Select **Builder** &gt; **Connectors**\n3. Select **Add connector**\n4. Select **MCP server** (User provided connector) and select **Next**\n\n![Select &quot;MCP server&quot; (User provided connector) as the connector type in the Add a connector dialog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/pagerduty-02-select-connector.png)\n\n1. Configure the connector:\n\n| Field | Value | | --- | --- | | **Name** | `pagerduty-mcp` | | **Connection type** | Streamable-HTTP | | **URL** | `https://mcp.pagerduty.com/mcp`<br> (use EU endpoint for EU service region) | | **Authentication** | Custom headers | | **Authorization** | `Token <your-pagerduty-api-token>` |\n\n1. Select **Next** to review\n\n![Configure the PagerDuty MCP connector with the endpoint URL and Authorization header using Token authentication](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/pagerduty-03-config-form.png)\n\n1. Select **Add connector**\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The token format in the `Authorization`\n> header must be `Token <your-api-token>`\n> (not `Bearer`\n> ). For example: `Token u+abcdefg123456789`\n> . Using the wrong format will result in `401 Unauthorized`\n> errors.\n> > >\n> [!NOTE]\n> Once the connector shows **Connected** status, the PagerDuty MCP tools are automatically available to your agent. You can verify by checking the tools list in the connector details.\n> >\n\n![Connectors list showing pagerduty-mcp with Connected status](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/pagerduty-01-connectors-list.png)\n\n## Step 3: Create a PagerDuty subagent (optional)\n\nCreate a specialized subagent to give the AI focused PagerDuty incident management expertise and better prompt responses.\n\n1.

Navigate to **My Profile** &gt; **User Settings** &gt; **API Access** in PagerDuty\n2. Delete the existing API User Token\n3. Create a new API User Token\n4. Update the connector in the SRE Agent portal with the new token value in the `Authorization`\nheader (format: `Token <new-token>` )\n\n## Limitations\n\n| Limitation | Details | | --- | --- | | **User-scoped permissions** | API token permissions are tied to the creating user's account; the token cannot exceed the user's access level | | **Self-hosted write restriction** | The self-hosted MCP server only exposes read-only tools by default; write tools require the `--enable-write-tools`<br> flag | | **Rate limits** | API rate limits apply per your PagerDuty plan; high-frequency usage may be throttled | | **No dedicated connector type** | The portal does not have a dedicated PagerDuty connector; you must use the generic MCP server connector and configure headers manually | | **Two regional endpoints only** | Only US and EU service regions are supported; the endpoint must match your account's service region | | **Token rotation** | API tokens do not automatically expire; manual rotation is recommended as a security best practice |\n\n## Security considerations\n\n### How permissions work\n\n- **User-scoped**: All actions respect the permissions of the PagerDuty user account that created the API token\n- **Token-based**: A single User API Token in the `Authorization`\nheader provides both authentication and authorization\n- **Role-based**: The token inherits the PagerDuty role (Observer, Responder, Manager, Admin, etc.) of the creating user\n\n### Data security\n\n- All traffic encrypted via HTTPS (TLS 1.2+)\n- User API tokens authenticate both the account and the user's permission scope\n- API usage can be monitored via PagerDuty audit logs\n\n### Admin controls\n\nPagerDuty administrators can:\n- Create and revoke User API tokens from user profile settings\n- Assign roles to user accounts to control permission scope\n- Use service accounts with restricted roles to limit the blast radius of compromised tokens\n- Monitor API token usage through PagerDuty's audit logs\n- Enforce token rotation policies as part of security governance\n\n> >\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> PagerDuty User API tokens can read and modify sensitive operational data including incidents, on-call schedules, and service configurations. Use service account tokens with restricted roles, grant only the permissions your agent needs, and rotate tokens regularly. Monitor the PagerDuty audit logs for unusual activity.\n> >\n\n## Related content\n\n- [PagerDuty MCP Server documentation](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/pagerduty-mcp-server/)\n- [PagerDuty REST API v2 documentation](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/)\n- [PagerDuty API Access Keys](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys)\n- [PagerDuty User Roles](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/user-roles)\n- [PagerDuty Audit Records](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/audit-records)\n- [MCP integration overview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/mcp-integration.md)\n- [Build a custom subagent](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/build-custom-subagent.md)\n\nPublished Feb 25, 2026\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[!\\[dbandaru&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xODc2Mjc5LTU4NDM2OWk2MjcxQjY2RTZCMEQzMDkw?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/dbandaru/1876279) [dbandaru](/users/dbandaru/1876279) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined May 24, 2023\n\n[View Profile](/users/dbandaru/1876279)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity"
