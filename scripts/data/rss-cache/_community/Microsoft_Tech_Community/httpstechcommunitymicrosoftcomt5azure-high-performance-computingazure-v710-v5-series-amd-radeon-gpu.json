It leans heavily on:\n\n- OpenGL acceleration\n- Shader-based rendering\n- Hidden line removal\n- Real-time shading / material rendering\n- Ray-Traced Studio for photorealistic output\n\n- Switch shading modes → CAD content must stay readable\n- Zoom, section, annotate → requires stable frame pacing\n\n#### **NVads V710 v5-Series on Azure**\n\n**** The NVads V710 v5-series virtual machines on Azure are designed for GPU-accelerated workloads and virtual desktop environments.

The results demonstrate stable and consistent rendering during interactive workflows, confirming that the GPU driver and visualization stack reliably support user‑driven NX operations. The measured execution times (in seconds) reflect the responsiveness of each interactive graphics operation, indicating predictable behavior under live, user‑controlled conditions rather than peak performance tuning.\n\n****\n\n| **NX CAD functions** | **Automatic Tests** | **Interactive Tests** | | --- | --- | --- | | Grace1 Basic Tests | GrPlayer\\_xp64.exe Basic\\_Features.tgl | Passed! | Passed! | | GrPlayer\\_xp64.exe Fog\\_Measurement\\_Clipping.tgl | Passed! | Passed! | | GrPlayer\\_xp64.exe lighting.tgl | Passed! | Passed! | | GrPlayer\\_xp64.exe Shadow\\_Bump\\_Environment.tgl | Passed! | Passed! | | GrPlayer\\_xp64.exe Texture\\_Map.tgl | Passed! | Passed! | | Grace2 Graphics Tests | GrPlayer\\_64.exe GrACETrace.tgl | Passed! | Passed! | | Grace2 Graphics Tests | GrPlayer\\_64.exe GrACETrace.tgl | Passed! | Passed! |\n\n| **NXCP Test Scenarios** | | | --- | --- | | **Automatic Tests** | | NXCP Gdat Tests | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_1.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_2.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_4.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_5.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_6.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_7.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_8.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_9.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_10.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_11.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_12.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_13.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_14.cgi | Passed! | | gdat\\_leg\\_xp64.exe -infile leg\\_gfx\\_cert\\_15.cgi | Passed! |\n\n#### **Benefits Azure NVads\\_v710 (AMD GPU Platform for NX**\n\n- **Workstation-class AMD Radeon PRO graphics drivers baked into Azure**\nEnsures ISV-validated driver pipeline.\n- **Excellent performance for CAD workloads**\nMakes GPU-accelerated NX accessible to wider user bases.\n- **Remote engineering enablement**\nCritical for companies who now operate global design teams.\n- **Elastic scale**\nSpin up GPU when development peaks; scale down when idle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSiemens NX on Azure NVads\\_v710 powered by AMD GPUs enables enterprise-class CAD/CAM/CAE experiences in the cloud.
