  "Description": "Andrea and Kedasha sit down with data whisperer, Jeff Luszcz, one of the wizards behind GitHub’s annual Octoverse report, to unpack this year’s biggest shifts. They get into why TypeScript overtook Python on GitHub, how AI-assisted “vibe coding” and agentic workflows are reshaping everyday engineering, and what it means that more than one new developer joins GitHub every second. From 1.12B open source contributions and 518M merged PRs to COBOL’s unexpected comeback, global growth (hello India, Brazil and Indonesia), and “security by default” with CodeQL and Dependabot, this episode turns the numbers into next steps for your career and your open source projects.\n\nLinks mentioned in the episode:\n\nhttps://octoverse.github.com https://github.com/jeffrey-luszcz https://github.com/features/copilot https://codeql.github.com https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning https://www.typescriptlang.org https://www.python.org https://nextjs.org https://vitejs.dev https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot https://www.home-assistant.io https://code.visualstudio.com https://github.com/explore\n\nThe GitHub Podcast is hosted by Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, Kedasha Kerr and Cassidy Williams.
