  "Description": "This week on The Download, Andrea covers the massive wave of new AI models, including GPT-5.3-Codex, Claude Opus 4.6, and Claude Sonnet 4.6. We also dive into GitHub's new agentic workflows and Agent HQ, allowing AI to fix CI failures and write code directly from issues. Plus, learn about the new repo-level pull request controls to stop spam. Finally, we discuss the OpenClaw creator joining OpenAI, the sunsetting of the CIA World Factbook, and the 25th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto.\n\n#GitHub #AI #OpenClaw\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ WANT TO LEARN MORE? 🚀 ▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nGPT-5.3-Codex: https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-09-gpt-5-3-codex-is-now-generally-available-for-github-copilot/ Claude Opus 4.6: https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-05-claude-opus-4-6-is-now-generally-available-for-github-copilot/ CIA World Factbook sunset: https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/spotlighting-the-world-factbook-as-we-bid-a-fond-farewell/ Simon Willison writeup: https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/5/the-world-factbook/ PR access controls: https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-new-repository-settings-for-configuring-pull-request-access/ Eternal September blog post: https://github.blog/2026-02-12-welcome-to-the-eternal-september-of-open-source-heres-what-we-plan-to-do-for-maintainers/ Agentic workflows: https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-github-agentic-workflows-are-now-in-technical-preview/ Agent HQ blog post: https://github.blog/2026-02-04-pick-your-agent-use-claude-and-codex-on-agent-hq/ /fleet demo: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46c0b3af-c6ed-4e5f-8f3f-063e5e5ec0cc OpenClaw joins OpenAI: https://steipete.me/posts/2026/openclaw Agile Manifesto: https://agilemanifesto.org/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ TIMESTAMPS ⌚ ▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n00:00 Welcome to The Download 00:31 3 new AI models in two weeks 00:58 CIA World Factbook sunset 01:20 New pull request access controls 01:46 GitHub announces agentic workflows 02:33 Agent HQ and the /fleet command 03:11 OpenClaw creator joins OpenAI 03:36 The Agile Manifesto turns 25\n\nStay up-to-date on all things GitHub by connecting with us:\n\nYouTube: https://gh.io/subgithub Blog: https://github.blog X: https://twitter.com/github LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/github Insider newsletter: https://resources.github.com/newsletter/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/github TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@github\n\nAbout GitHub It’s where over 180 million developers create, share, and ship the best code possible.
