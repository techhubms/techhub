  "Description": "Designer Cameron Foxly wanted to bring the Copilot mascot to life inside the terminal—so he used GitHub Copilot to help him build his own ASCII animation tool from scratch. In this behind-the-scenes look, Cameron walks through how he prototyped a frame editor, painted ANSI colors, generated animation loops, and shipped his first engineering PR in nearly a decade.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered how design, animation, and terminal engineering come together—or how Copilot can accelerate creative technical work—this breakdown shows the real workflow behind Copilot CLI’s animated banner.\n\n👉 Try GitHub Copilot CLI and bring AI-powered workflows to your terminal: https://gh.io/copilot-cli\n\n#ASCII #OpenSource #GitHubCopilot\n\nStay up-to-date on all things GitHub by subscribing and following us at: YouTube: http://bit.ly/subgithub Blog: https://github.blog X: https://twitter.com/github LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/github Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/github TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@github Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GitHub/\n\nAbout GitHub: It’s where over 180 million developers create, share, and ship the best code possible.
