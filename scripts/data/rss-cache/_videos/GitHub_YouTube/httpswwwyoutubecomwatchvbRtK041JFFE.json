  "Description": "GitHub Copilot CLI just went generally available, and we are going live to break it down with Ryan Hecht. This is not just \"ask AI to write a shell command.\" Copilot CLI is an agentic assistant with specialized built-in agents for exploring codebases, running tasks, planning implementations, and reviewing code. It can work step by step with your approval or run autonomously, all without leaving your terminal.\n\n#GitHub #GitHubCopilot #CLI #LiveCoding",
