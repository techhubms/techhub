  "Description": "Join us for Open Source Friday as we spotlight Handy, a free, open source, and extensible speech-to-text application that runs completely offline. In this APAC-friendly session (8:00 AM ET on February 6, 2026), we’ll be joined by CJ Pais (@cjpais), the creator of Handy. After breaking a finger and ending up in a cast, CJ discovered that existing speech-to-text tools weren’t open source, extensible, or easily hackable—so Handy was born to fill that gap.",
