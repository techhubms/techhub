  "Description": "Grab your favorite beverage and join us for a laid-back, community-powered yap-session about where we want open source to go this year. No slides, no demos...just unfiltered hopes, hot takes, and wild ideas for 2026. Bring your wishlist: better docs, greener CI, maintainer burnout fixes, AI that actually helps, or something we haven’t even imagined yet.",
