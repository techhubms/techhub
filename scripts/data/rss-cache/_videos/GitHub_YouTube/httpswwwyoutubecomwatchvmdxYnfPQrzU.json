  "Description": "Homebrew’s project lead, Mike McQuaid, joins Abby and Andrea to unpack what it really takes to sustain one of the most-used developer tools on macOS and Linux. From early GitHub workflows to today’s automation and guardrails, Mike details the soft-power leadership that keeps volunteers motivated, and shares insights on how to scale contributions, keep a small maintainer team effective, and triage with empathy (and boundaries). This episode covers governance, “saying no,” using AI responsibly, and how IRL feedback at Universe turned into performance wins.\n\nLinks mentioned in the episode:\n\nhttps://brew.sh https://www.macports.org https://fosdem.org https://githubuniverse.com https://mikemcquaid.com https://github.com/TheoPFR/somo https://github.com/github/spec-kit https://flukeout.github.io/\n\nThe GitHub Podcast is hosted by Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, Kedasha Kerr and Cassidy Williams.
