  "Description": "Join us for Open Source Friday with Patrick Nikoletich, where we’ll explore the Copilot SDK (`github/copilot-sdk`) and how it can be used to build AI-assisted developer experiences on GitHub. The Copilot SDK, now in technical preview, lets you embed the same agentic core behind Copilot CLI into any application, so it can plan steps, invoke tools, edit files, and run commands while your app provides the domain-specific tools, constraints, and context. We’ll walk through what the SDK offers, how the pieces fit together, and where contributors can make a meaningful impact and help shape what’s next for the project.",
