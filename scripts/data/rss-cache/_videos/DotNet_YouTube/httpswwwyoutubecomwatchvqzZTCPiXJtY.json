  "Description": "This session will be about showcasing a custom educational platform that our guest, Johnny Hooyberghs, used while organizing a Microsoft quantum computing workshop. It's about sharing his experiences building an ASP.NET Blazor web applications, used by participants to interactively solve Q# programming challenges, and allow them to get real-time feedback on their proposed solutions by running the Q# compiler and simulator through .NET, hosted on Azure. Additionally, the web application has a built-in custom Copilot to their disposal that can help them solve challenges and teach them by providing it real-time access to the challenges and their proposed solutions.\n\n#dotnet",
