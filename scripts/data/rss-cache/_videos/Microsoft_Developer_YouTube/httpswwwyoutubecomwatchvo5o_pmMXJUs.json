  "Description": "Welcome to the next MVP Unplugged, where Microsoft MVPs share real-world projects and insights from the field! In this episode, host Justin Garrett sits down with Microsoft MVP Veronika Kolesnikova to explore how she picks the right AI model for common developer tasks using Evaluations in Microsoft Foundry, complete with query-context-results, Python SDK workflows, and measures for evaluation. We'll explore some fun datasets around hiking, acrobatics, and common developer terminology too! Veronika walks through her full process—from generating datasets with GitHub Copilot, to running multi-model evaluations, to analyzing outputs in the Microsoft Foundry portal. Whether you’re building agents, experimenting with models, or ensuring AI reliability at scale, this episode breaks down a repeatable and practical approach you can use today.\n\nIn this episode, you’ll learn ✅How to build custom evaluation datasets using AI ✅How to compare outputs across models like GPT‑5, Grok-4, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 ✅How to run Evaluations programmatically using the new Microsoft Foundry SDK ✅How to measure AI performance using F1, METEOR, similarity scores, and thresholds ✅Tips for choosing the right model for your AI agent ✅Practical debugging and iteration strategies for model quality ✅How to store and version evaluation datasets in Microsoft Foundry\n\n🔗 Chapter Markers 00:00 – Intro to MVP Unplugged 00:20 – Meet Microsoft MVP Veronika Kolesnikova 02:20 – Introducing Microsoft Foundry Evaluations 03:03 – Circus, Hiking & Engineering: Creating AI Data Sets 04:55 – Inside the Jupyter Notebooks & Evaluation Setup 06:11 – Connecting to Azure AI Projects 07:55 – Dataset Structure: Query, Context, Ground Truth 09:14 – Why Evaluations Matter for Real AI Projects 10:42 – Exploring the Foundry UI (Classic + New Portal) 12:04 – Uploading and Versioning Data Sets in Foundry 13:37 – Evaluation Results: GPT‑5, Claude, Grok 18:29 – Thresholds, System Prompts & Model Behavior 21:07 – Deep Dive: Quad vs GPT‑5 Performance 23:17 – Short Answers vs Long Answers & Scoring 24:20 – Circus Data Set Analysis 25:25 – Software Engineering Data Set Results 27:51 – Documentation & Learning Resources 29:04 – Running Evaluations with the New Foundry SDK 31:12 – Differences Between Old & New SDK 32:17 – How Veronika Chooses the Best Model 35:22 – GitHub Copilot for Model Testing 36:28 – Microsoft Learn Resources 37:26 – What Veronika Wants AI To Do Next 38:32 – Final Advice for Developers 39:03 – Closing\n\n👉 Subscribe for more MVP insights and AI-powered development tips!\n\n#microsoftdeveloper #MVPUnplugged #MicrosoftFoundry #AIEvaluations #AzureAI #GitHubCopilot #AIModels #MachineLearning #Claude #Grok #GPT5 #DeveloperCommunity #AIEngineering #JupyterNotebooks #pythondevelopers\n\n🔗 Resources & Links 🎁Free Microsoft Foundry Trial https://aka.ms/devrelft 📚 Microsoft Foundry Observability https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/observability 🧪 Foundry Model Leaderboard https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/leaderboard 📘 Evaluating AI Models https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/foundry/evaluations 💻 Veronika’s GitHub Repo (Evaluation Project) https://github.com/Veroni4ka/RAI\\_notebooks/ 🚀 Try GitHub Copilot https://github.com/features/copilot\n\nMVP Unplugged Playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhclud3yVB88znZPKCZYX\\_8&si=4HoycKJyUcl1qwV-\n\nAbout Veronika Veronika Kolesnikova is a Microsoft MVP in AI and a Principal AI Engineer at Liberty Mutual in Boston MA.
