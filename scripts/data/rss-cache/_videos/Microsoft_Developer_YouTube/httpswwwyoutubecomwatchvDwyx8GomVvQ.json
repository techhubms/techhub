  "Description": "This episode of the Azure Essentials Show brings the Armchair Architects—Uli, Eric, and David—together to tackle multi-agent architecture in the enterprise. You'll get practical insights into orchestrating AI agents, preventing data leaks, managing costs, and choosing the right design patterns. The trio highlight real-world strategies, emerging tools, and actionable frameworks to help you build secure, scalable agent systems.\n\nResources\n- Azure Architecture Center https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/\n- AutoGen https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/autogen\n- Introduction to Semantic Kernel https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/overview/\n- Microsoft Purview https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/\n- Microsoft Fabric documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/\n- Agent Framework documentation https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/\n\nThree important things you will learn\n- How to architect and orchestrate multiple AI agents, including key patterns like specialist delegation, sequential workflows, and parallel agent reasoning.\n- The importance of data leak prevention, security policies, and governance when deploying agents in enterprise environments.\n- Practical considerations for agent design, such as cost management, model selection, and leveraging message-based systems for scalability and reliability.\n\nRecommended Next Steps\n- Review and apply message-based architectural patterns (such as those used in message brokers) as a foundation for agent orchestration.\n- Explore open-source frameworks like Microsoft Research Autogen and Semantic Kernel to understand and experiment with multi-agent patterns.\nAssess and implement data governance and security controls, including data leak prevention, for agent interactions within your organization.\n\nRelated Episodes\n- Watch more episodes of Armchair Architects https://aka.ms/ArmchairArchitects\n- Watch more episodes of the Azure Essentials Show https://aka.ms/AzureEssentialsShow\n\nConnect\n- David Blank-Edelman https://www.linkedin.com/in/dnblankedelman/\n- Uli Homann https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulrichhomann/\n- Eric Charran https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericcharran/\n\nChapters 00:00 Hey!
