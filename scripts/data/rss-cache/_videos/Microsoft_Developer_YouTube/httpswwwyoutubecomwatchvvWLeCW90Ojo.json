  "Description": "Welcome back to the Cozy AI Kitchen, where we cook up delightful creations with AI, design, and developer tools. Today, John Maeda welcomes Elijah King, Product Designer on the VS Code team, to show how anyone — yes, even non‑developers — can build fully functional apps using natural language, AI agents, and VS Code.
