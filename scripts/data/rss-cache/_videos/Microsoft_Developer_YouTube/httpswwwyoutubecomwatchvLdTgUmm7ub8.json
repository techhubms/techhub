  "Description": "Welcome back to the Cozy AI Kitchen, where we stir up warm conversations about the coolest tech innovations. In this episode, host John Maeda welcomes Tim Chung, GM of Autonomy and Robotics at Microsoft, for an energizing, hands-on look at how AI is transforming robotics — and what it means for the future of human–robot collaboration. From action models to physical intelligence, from Teams-connected robots to LED-powered robot dances, this episode brings you right into the next frontier: robots as teammates. Whether you’re a developer, roboticist, maker, or simply “robotics curious,” this is your perfect deep-dive into how generative AI is opening entirely new possibilities in physical autonomy.\n\n⏱️ CHAPTERS 00:00 – The robots are already here 00:16 – Meet Tim Chung, Microsoft’s robot whisperer 00:40 – Why the era of AI + robotics is different 01:06 – From language to action: action tokens explained 01:32 – Modeling randomness and real‑world unpredictability 02:01 – Introducing the Rainbow Robot 02:20 – Robots joining a Microsoft Teams meeting 03:13 – The Rainbow Robot demo: LEDs, zero‑position, and dance 05:30 – What’s next: the future of robots as teammates 06:20 – Advice for aspiring roboticists 07:00 – Closing thoughts and future possibilities\n\n🎯 WHAT YOU’LL LEARN\n- How generative AI is shaping physical intelligence and real‑world robotics\n- What action tokens are and why roboticists rely on them\n- How robots can join Microsoft Teams as collaborators\n- Why randomness, probability, and generalization matter in robot control\n- How robotic agents can shift from tools to teammates\n- The emerging interplay between LLMs, vision models, and physical action models\n👥 SPEAKERS Tim Chung GM, Autonomy and Robotics, Microsoft https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothy-h-chung/\n\nJohn Maeda Host, Cozy AI Kitchen VP of Design and Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmaeda/\n\n🔗 RESOURCES & LINKS 🚀 Try Azure for free https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT 📚 Explore Microsoft Learn https://learn.microsoft.com 📚 Learn more about AI tools for creators: https://learn.microsoft.com/ai 📺 Watch all Cozy AI Kitchen episodes https://aka.ms/CAIK-YTPlaylist\n\n📌 HASHTAGS #CozyAIKitchen #MicrosoftDeveloper #Robotics #AI #AutonomousSystems #AzureAI #GenerativeAI #RobotTeammates #ActionModels #PhysicalIntelligence #MicrosoftRobotics #AIInTheRealWorld #Developers #TechDemo",
