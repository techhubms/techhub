  "Description": "Autonomous agents are transforming work, but the gold is in the collaboration between people and agents. Instead of users handling every step, they’ll now supervise, review, and guide agent-driven workflows.\n- Power Apps meets users where they are and makes this collaboration natural.\n- With Microsoft 365, individuals work directly with their business data, while Power Apps allows makers to extend the data and act across the wider Microsoft 365 ecosystem.\n- The Agent Feed lets autonomous agents submit tasks for human review, approval and supervision, ensuring oversight and continual quality improvement.\n\nThese patterns help teams move faster without sacrificing control or compliance, and they make impact measurable from day one.\n\nThis episode will cover live demos of the collaboration surfaces across Microsoft 365 and Power Apps, plus the Agent Feed in action. Watch now to see the next step in the evolution of low code and autonomous agents.\n\n⤵️ To learn more, watch the Microsoft Ignite session on-demand Power Apps: Reimagine the human-agent collaboration - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=matmvydKkmM",
