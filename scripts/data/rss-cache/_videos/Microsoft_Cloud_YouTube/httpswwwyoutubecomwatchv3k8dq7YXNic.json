  "Description": "Retail is entering a new phase where AI agents—not just websites or apps—mediate discovery, consideration, and purchase. This is not incremental eCommerce optimization; it is a structural shift in how shoppers buy.\n\nAgentic commerce refers to AI-driven shopping experiences where intelligent agents reason, recommend, and take action on behalf of consumers (and merchants), while humans remain in control. Agents can compare products, apply preferences, manage carts, and complete checkout across owned and third‑party surfaces.\n\nMicrosoft is helping retailers prepare for this shift with trusted AI, a scalable cloud foundation, and deep retail expertise.\n\nMicrosoft for Retail: https://msft.it/6050Qz6Ri\n\nAudio Description: https://msft.it/6051Qz6Rc\n\n#AIShoppingAgents #MicrosoftforRetail #RetailAI",
