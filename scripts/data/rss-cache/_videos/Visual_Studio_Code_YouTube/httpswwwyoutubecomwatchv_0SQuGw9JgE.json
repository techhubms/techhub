  "Description": "We will see how to fully create from scratch a Space Invaders game using GitHub Copilot and the latest models available. Using MCP, we will see how to better control the flow either such as the one from Figma for the UX, AI Toolkit for the connection to a LLM or Playwright to let the AI auto-review itself. To go even further, we will use Spec Kit to implement the leaderboard section. At last, we will use the Azure MCP to deploy to the cloud.\n\n🔗 Links: Install Copilot: https://aka.ms/InstallCopilot GitHub MCP: https://github.com/mcp MCP Center: https://mcp.azure.com/ AI Toolkit: https://aka.ms/AIToolkit GitHub Spec Kit: https://speckit.org/ Install Azure CLI Tools: https://aka.ms/AzureCLITools/install Install Azure Developer CLI: https://aka.ms/AzureDeveloperCLI/install Install GitHub Copilot for Azure: https://aka.ms/CopilotforAzure/install Azure CLI Docs: https://aka.ms/AzureCLI/docs Azure Developer CLI Docs: https://aka.ms/AzureDevCLI/docs Personal Access Tokens: https://github.com/settings/tokens\n\n🎙️ Featuring: David Roussett (@davrous), Reynald Adolphe (@ReynaldAdolphe)\n\n#vscode #ai",
