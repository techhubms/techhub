  "Description": "Join us for VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day on Feb 19th: a global virtual event celebrating how Visual Studio Code continues to evolve as the world’s most loved editor, now redefined with AI. Join the VS Code product team, special guests, and community builders for live demos and behind‑the‑scenes stories showing how VS Code enables agentic development while staying true to its core values: open, extensible, and deeply community‑driven. See how developers are using agents, customizable workflows, and open integrations to build smarter.\n\nWhether you’re experimenting with AI‑assisted coding or pushing the boundaries of what agentic development can be, VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day will give you practical ideas you can apply right away. This isn’t about locking you into one way of working - it’s about empowering you to shape your own.\n\n🎙️ Featuring: Olivia Guzzardo McVicker (@OliviaGuzzardo) and members of the VS Code Team!\n\n#vscode #code #agent",
