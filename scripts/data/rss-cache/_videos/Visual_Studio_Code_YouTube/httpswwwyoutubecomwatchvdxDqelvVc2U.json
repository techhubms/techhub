  "Description": "Get hands on with GitHub Copilot and coding agents all from VS Code! Go beyond the basics of agentic development and see how Copilot and VS Code's agent mode along side MCP servers and custom agents help you boost developer productivity. In this lab we will build and integrate new features into an existing app and see our changes live in minutes instead of days. You will learn how to customize your results from Copilot to get the high quality code based on your teams preferences and see how to run agents beyond VS Code in the background with the Copilot CLI or GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent that runs completely asynchronously in the cloud.\n\nJoin the conversation on the Microsoft Foundry Discord: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Discord Sign up for an Azure Free Trial: https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT Get hands-on with today's VS Code lab repo: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay2 Catch up on-demand: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/OnDemand Continue learning next week with AI Apps & Agents' global sessions: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Next Register for the January AI Dev Days Hackathon: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Hackathon"
