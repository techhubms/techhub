  "Description": "Watch Burke Holland and Pierce Boggan go head‑to‑head in a timed, live‑coding challenge, each using agents in a different way to solve the same task. Then Olivia Guzzardo McVicker joins to help them break down what worked, what didn’t, and how you can try similar agent workflows in your own projects.\n\nhttps://aka.ms/vscode/109 https://aka.ms/vscode/insiders https://aka.ms/vscode/live https://aka.ms/vscode/109blog https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot",
