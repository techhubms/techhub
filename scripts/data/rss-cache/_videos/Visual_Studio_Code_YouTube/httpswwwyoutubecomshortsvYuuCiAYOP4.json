Go from basic terminal chat to instant codebase symbol extraction, deep package documentation research, and real AST-powered code search (tree-sitter, not regex!). In under 3 minutes you’ll learn how to get setup with kit-dev MCP + live demos of the features you can use every single day. If you code, you need to try this out.\n\nGitHub Copilot CLI: https://aka.ms/gh-copilot-cli kit-dev MCP Server: https://kit-mcp.cased.com",
