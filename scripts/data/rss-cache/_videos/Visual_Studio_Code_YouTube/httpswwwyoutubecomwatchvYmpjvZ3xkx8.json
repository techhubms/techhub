We'll dive into cloud agents—including Claude and Codex—and show how to delegate tasks to remote infrastructure, collaborate with your team through PRs, and leverage partner agents under your GitHub Copilot subscription.\n\nhttps://aka.ms/vscode/109 https://aka.ms/vscode/insiders https://aka.ms/vscode/live https://aka.ms/vscode/109blog https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot",
