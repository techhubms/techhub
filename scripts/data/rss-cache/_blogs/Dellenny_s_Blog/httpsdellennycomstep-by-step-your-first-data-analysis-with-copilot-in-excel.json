Today, Microsoft Copilot in Excel makes the process faster, more intuitive, and more approachable—even for beginners. Copilot works as an AI-powered assistant within Excel, helping you analyze spreadsheets, clean messy data, create insights, and build visualizations using natural language prompts.\n\nWhether you are new to data analysis or looking for smarter ways to explore information, this guide walks you through performing your first analysis using Copilot in Excel, step by step.\n\n## **Before You Start: What You Need**\n\nTo follow along, you’ll need:\n\n- Microsoft 365 with access to Copilot in Excel\n- A dataset in Excel (sales data, marketing performance, survey results, etc.)\n\nIf you don’t have sample data, a simple table with columns like **Date, Product, Units Sold, Region, and Revenue** will work perfectly.\n\n## **Step 1: Open Your Dataset and Launch Copilot**\n\nStart by opening your spreadsheet in Excel. Look for the **Copilot icon**, typically located in the ribbon or panel on the right side.\n\nClick it to open the Copilot sidebar. You’ll now see a prompt box where you can ask questions about your data in plain English.\n\n## **Step 2: Ask Copilot to Understand Your Data**\n\nBefore diving into charts or calculations, it’s helpful to ask Copilot for an initial overview. Try entering:\n\n>\n> “Give me a summary of this dataset.”\n>\n\nCopilot may return details such as:\n\n- Number of rows and columns\n- Key metrics (like totals and averages)\n- Patterns such as best-selling products or peak dates\n\nThis high-level snapshot is a great starting point, especially if you’re opening the file for the first time.\n\n## **Step 3: Clean the Data with Copilot**\n\nData cleaning is usually the most time-consuming part of analysis, but Copilot can help dramatically. You can ask it to:\n\n- Identify missing values\n- Detect duplicates\n- Standardize formats\n- Flag inconsistent entries\n\nUseful prompts include:\n\n- “Find any duplicate rows.”\n- “Show records with missing revenue data.”\n- “Clean formatting so all dates follow the same format.”\n\nCopilot can also apply the fixes automatically when you approve them.\n\n## **Step 4: Run Descriptive Analysis**\n\nOnce the data is cleaned, move into basic analytics. This step answers questions like:\n\n- What is the average revenue per sale?\n- Which regions perform best?\n- What months show spikes or drops?\n\nYou can ask:\n\n>\n> “Calculate average revenue by region.”\n>\n\nCopilot can produce a new table, highlight a subset of rows, or even generate formulas for you.\n\nOther prompts include:\n\n- “Show me total revenue for each product line.”\n- “Which dates had the highest sales?”\n- “What is the minimum and maximum number of units sold?”\n\nIf you’re not comfortable writing formulas, this step is a game-changer.\n\n## **Step 5: Generate Charts and Visual Insights**\n\nOnce you’ve identified key numbers, Copilot can turn those insights into visualizations—no digging through menus required.\n\nTry prompts like:\n\n- “Create a column chart showing revenue by product category.”\n- “Plot a trend line of total sales over time.”\n- “Show a pie chart of market share by region.”\n\nCopilot will insert the chart directly into your spreadsheet. If you want to customize it, follow up with prompts like:\n\n- “Make the chart title bolder.”\n- “Change labels to show percentages.”\n\nThis is ideal for people preparing reports or presentations.\n\n## **Step 6: Detect Trends and Patterns Automatically**\n\nBeyond basic summaries, Copilot can analyze patterns in your data and highlight insights you may not have seen. For example:\n\n- Long-term increases or decreases\n- Seasonal trends\n- Outlier values\n- Unexpected relationships\n\nTry prompts such as:\n\n- “Identify trends in revenue month over month.”\n- “Highlight any abnormal data points.”\n- “What product categories had the biggest growth this quarter?”\n\nCopilot often provides both text insights and visual backing, making your analysis richer.\n\n## **Step 7: Ask for Recommendations**\n\nAnother advantage of Copilot is its ability to suggest next steps. If you’re unsure what to explore next, ask:\n\n>\n> “What should I analyze next?”\n>\n\nCopilot may suggest additional comparisons, pivot tables, or deeper segmentation. This is especially helpful for new analysts who are still learning how to frame questions.\n\n## **Step 8: Create a Final Summary**\n\nOnce you’re done, you can ask Copilot to compile everything into a report. Try:\n\n- “Summarize the key findings from this dataset.”\n- “Generate bullet points outlining the main business insights.”\n- “Create a paragraph I can paste into a presentation.”\n\nThis can save hours when preparing for meetings or stakeholder updates.\n\n## **Why Copilot Makes Excel Analysis Easier**\n\nUsing Copilot in Excel has several big advantages:\n\n- **You don’t need to know formulas or pivot tables to start.**\n- **It dramatically reduces manual formatting and cleanup time.**\n- **You can move faster from raw data to real insights.**\n- **It helps users think analytically by suggesting meaningful questions.**\n\nFor beginners, it lowers the learning curve. For experienced analysts, it speeds up repetitive work.\n\nPerforming data analysis in Excel used to require knowledge of formulas, data validation, pivot tables, and charting features. With Copilot, you can have a conversational, AI-powered partner guiding you through the entire workflow—from cleaning and summarizing data to generating charts and reports.\n\nIf you haven’t tried it yet, open an Excel file and start asking questions. The more you explore, the more you’ll discover how powerful AI-assisted analysis can be.\n\nWhether you’re a student, analyst, business owner, or manager, Microsoft Copilot in Excel can make your data analysis faster, easier, and smarter.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-your-first-data-analysis-with-copilot-in-excel/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-your-first-data-analysis-with-copilot-in-excel/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-your-first-data-analysis-with-copilot-in-excel/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-your-first-data-analysis-with-copilot-in-excel/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-your-first-data-analysis-with-copilot-in-excel/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[M365 Copilot](https://dellenny.com/tag/m365-copilot/ \"M365 Copilot\")\n\n[previousHow to Generate Formulas Using Copilot in Excel](https://dellenny.com/how-to-generate-formulas-using-copilot-in-excel/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
