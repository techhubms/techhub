  "EnhancedContent": "# How to Implement Azure AD Conditional Access Policies Step-by-Step\n\n- by [John Edward](https://dellenny.com/author/delenyprogmail-com/)\n- November 26, 2025November 26, 2025\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Azure-AD-Conditional-Access-Policies.jpg?fit=300%2C287&amp;ssl=1)\n\nIn today’s cloud-first world, identity is the new security perimeter. With employees logging in from different devices, locations, and networks, traditional access control is no longer enough. This is where **Azure AD (now Microsoft Entra ID) Conditional Access** comes in. It allows organizations to enforce automated decision-making about who can access what, under which conditions, and using which devices.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered how to configure Conditional Access the right way, without breaking user access or causing downtime, this guide walks you through the process\n\n## **What is Azure AD Conditional Access?**\n\nAzure AD Conditional Access is a policy-based identity security engine in Microsoft Entra ID. It enforces access decisions based on signals like:\n\n- User identity and group membership\n- Device compliance\n- User location\n- Application sensitivity\n- Risk level\n- Session behavior\n\nA typical Conditional Access decision looks like:\n\n**IF** user tries to access a corporate application **FROM** an unmanaged device **THEN** require MFA or block access entirely.\n\nConditional Access is a core pillar of the **Zero Trust** model, offering automated, tailored security without constant administrator intervention.\n\n## **Prerequisites Before You Begin**\n\nBefore you can start implementing policies, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:\n\n### **1. Licensing Requirements**\n\nYou need one of the following:\n\n- Microsoft Entra ID P1 (for core Conditional Access features)\n- Microsoft Entra ID P2 (for risk-based Conditional Access)\n- Microsoft 365 E3/E5 licensing bundles\n\n### **2. Administrator Permissions**\n\nYou should have:\n\n- Global Administrator\n- Security Administrator\n- Conditional Access Administrator\n\n### **3. Test Accounts**\n\nNever test with real user accounts—create at least:\n\n- One standard test user\n- One admin break-glass account (with MFA turned off)\n\nYour break-glass account will be your lifeline if something goes wrong.\n\n## **Step-by-Step Guide to Implement Azure AD Conditional Access**\n\nNow let’s walk through the full setup process.\n\n## **Step 1: Navigate to Conditional Access in Azure Portal**\n\n1. Sign in to the **Azure Portal**.\n2. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID**.\n3. Select **Protection** → **Conditional Access**.\n4. Click **+ New policy** to start creating.\n\nYou now have a blank policy canvas.\n\n## **Step 2: Configure Policy Assignments (Who and What)**\n\nThis is where you decide who the policy applies to and which resources it controls.\n\n### **1. Select Users or Groups**\n\nClick **Assignments → Users → Select users and groups**.\n\nChoose from:\n\n- All users\n- Specific users\n- Security groups\n- Directory roles\n\n**Tip:** Always start with **select users and groups**, and apply policies gradually. Never apply a new policy to all users at first.\n\n### **2. Select Cloud Apps or Actions**\n\nClick **Assignments → Cloud apps or actions**.\n\nChoose:\n\n- Microsoft 365 apps\n- Specific SaaS apps\n- Custom applications\n\nFor example, to protect Microsoft 365, choose **Office 365** as your target.\n\n## **Step 3: Configure Conditions (When and How)**\n\nYour policy becomes smart when you define conditions.\n\n### **1. Sign-in Risk**\n\nRequires P2 license. This helps detect risky logins based on Microsoft’s machine learning.\n\n### **2. Device Platform**\n\nTarget Windows, iOS, Android, or macOS.\n\n### **3. Locations**\n\nDefine trusted networks, usually your office IP ranges.\n\nExample: Block login attempts from outside trusted countries.\n\n### **4. Client Apps**\n\nTarget:\n\n- Browser\n- Mobile apps\n- Legacy authentication clients\n\nNote: Legacy authentication (IMAP, POP, SMTP) should typically be blocked.\n\n### **5. Device State**\n\nUse this to apply rules like:\n\n- *Require device to be compliant*\n- *Require hybrid Azure AD join*\n\n## **Step 4: Configure Access Controls**\n\nNow choose what happens when conditions are met.\n\nYou have two types of controls:\n\n### **Grant Controls (Allow or Block)**\n\n- Block access\n- Require MFA\n- Require device to be marked compliant\n- Require app protection policy\n- Require passwordless or phishing-resistant authentication\n\nMost organizations start with:\n\n- **Require MFA**\n- **Require compliant device**\n\n### **Session Controls**\n\nThese give you deeper control:\n\n- Sign-in frequency\n- Persistent browser session\n- Conditional Access App Control (Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps)\n\nThese help secure apps without constantly disturbing the user.\n\n## **Step 5: Set Policy Mode (Report-only, On, or Off)**\n\nThis choice determines your rollout strategy.\n\n### ✔ **Report-only Mode (Recommended First Step)**\n\nIn this mode:\n\n- The policy is evaluated\n- It does NOT enforce actions\n- Results show up in the sign-in logs\n\nThis allows safe testing without risk.\n\n### ✔ **On (Enforced)**\n\nUse this when:\n\n- Testing is done\n- You’ve validated impact\n\n### ✔ **Off (Disabled)**\n\nUse only when troubleshooting.\n\n**Tip:** Most organizations keep new policies in **Report-only** for at least 7–14 days.\n\n## **Step 6: Test Your Conditional Access Policy**\n\nBefore enforcement, you must test.\n\n### **Where to Test**\n\nGo to: **Microsoft Entra ID → Sign-in logs**\n\nFilter:\n\n- Date\n- User\n- “Report-only” results\n\nYou’ll see:\n\n- Whether the policy would have triggered\n- Which controls would apply\n- Any conflicts with other policies\n\nYou can also use the **Conditional Access What If tool** to simulate access scenarios.\n\n## **Step 7: Turn On the Policy After Validation**\n\nOnce you confirm everything works:\n\n1. Edit the policy\n2. Switch the toggle to **On**\n3. Save changes\n\nYour policy is now fully enforced.\n\n## **Best Practices for Azure AD Conditional Access**\n\n### **1. Use a layered approach**\n\nImplement policies individually:\n\n- Require MFA\n- Block legacy auth\n- Require compliant device access\n\nDon’t enable 10 new policies at once.\n\n### **2. Always exclude break-glass accounts**\n\nNever enforce Conditional Access on emergency accounts.\n\n### **3. Avoid policy conflicts**\n\nDuplicate or contradictory rules can cause blocked logins.\n\n### **4. Use naming conventions**\n\nExample: `CA01 - Require MFA for all users`\n\n### **5. Regularly audit sign-in logs**\n\nMonitor:\n\n- MFA failures\n- Unusual locations\n- Impossible travel alerts\n\n### **6. Document everything**\n\nYour future self will thank you.\n\nAzure AD Conditional Access is one of the most powerful tools for securing your Microsoft cloud environment. When implemented thoughtfully, it creates a seamless balance between security and usability. By following this step-by-step guide, you can ensure a safe, gradual, and controlled rollout of policies that protect your users, apps, and data.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-implement-azure-ad-conditional-access-policies-step-by-step/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-implement-azure-ad-conditional-access-policies-step-by-step/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-implement-azure-ad-conditional-access-policies-step-by-step/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-implement-azure-ad-conditional-access-policies-step-by-step/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-implement-azure-ad-conditional-access-policies-step-by-step/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[Azure](https://dellenny.com/tag/azure-2/ \"Azure\")\n\n[previousMicrosoft Ignite 2025: The Dawn of the AI-Agent Era](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-ignite-2025-the-dawn-of-the-ai-agent-era/)\n\n[nextManaging Azure AD Identity Protection: Detecting and Mitigating Risky Sign-ins](https://dellenny.com/managing-azure-ad-identity-protection-detecting-and-mitigating-risky-sign-ins/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
