Over the past decade, large enterprises across industries have moved from legacy, on-premises collaboration platforms to cloud-based ecosystems. One of the most common journeys has been migrating from SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online, part of the broader Microsoft 365 environment.\n\nWhile the promise of scalability, security, and collaboration is compelling, the path to the cloud is rarely straightforward. Large enterprises, in particular, face complex content structures, compliance requirements, legacy customizations, and deeply ingrained user habits.\n\nAfter observing multiple enterprise-scale migrations, several clear lessons stand out. If your organization is considering or actively planning a move to SharePoint Online, these insights can save you time, money, and frustration.\n\n![](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-4.png)\n## 1. Migration Is Not Just a Technical Project—It’s an Organizational Shift\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions is treating migration as an IT-only initiative. Technically, yes, files and sites are moving from one environment to another. But practically, you’re reshaping how people collaborate.\n\nLarge enterprises that succeeded in their migration efforts involved stakeholders early: HR, Legal, Compliance, Communications, and business unit leaders. Why? Because SharePoint isn’t just a storage system it’s where policies live, projects evolve, and institutional knowledge accumulates.\n\nWhen leadership frames the move to SharePoint Online as part of a broader digital workplace strategy, adoption improves dramatically.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Don’t just migrate content. Prepare your people.\n\n## 2. Clean Up Before You Move Anything\n\nIn almost every large enterprise, years (sometimes decades) of accumulated content live inside legacy environments. There are outdated documents, redundant libraries, abandoned team sites, and broken permissions structures.\n\nMany organizations initially attempt a “lift and shift” approach moving everything as-is. The result? Clutter in the cloud.\n\nThe smarter enterprises used migration as an opportunity to:\n\n- Archive obsolete content\n- Eliminate duplicates\n- Simplify site architecture\n- Standardize naming conventions\n- Reset permissions\n\nThis pre-migration cleanup significantly reduced storage costs and improved performance post-migration.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Migration is your one chance to declutter at scale. Take it.\n\n## 3. Customizations Can Become Roadblocks\n\nOn-premises SharePoint environments often contain heavy customizations custom web parts, workflows, InfoPath forms, third-party add-ins, and complex farm solutions.\n\nMany of these do not translate cleanly into SharePoint Online’s modern architecture.\n\nEnterprises that underestimated this gap faced delays and rework. Those that succeeded performed detailed assessments of:\n\n- Custom code dependencies\n- Legacy workflows\n- Third-party integrations\n- Unsupported features\n\nInstead of recreating every customization, forward-thinking teams evaluated whether the functionality was still necessary. Often, modern tools within Microsoft 365 like Power Automate, Power Apps, and Teams integration provided better alternatives.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Don’t replicate the past. Modernize it.\n\n## 4. Governance Must Be Defined Early\n\nLarge enterprises generate content rapidly. Without governance, SharePoint Online can quickly become chaotic just in a different environment.\n\nSuccessful migrations included a governance framework that covered:\n\n- Site provisioning policies\n- Ownership and lifecycle management\n- Metadata standards\n- External sharing controls\n- Compliance and retention policies\n\nWith SharePoint Online integrated into Microsoft 365, data is more interconnected than ever. Governance must account for Teams, OneDrive, and other connected services.\n\nOrganizations that delayed governance discussions found themselves scrambling after users began creating hundreds of unmanaged sites.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Governance is not optional it’s foundational.\n\n## 5. Security and Compliance Require Revalidation\n\nMoving to the cloud does not automatically solve security challenges. In fact, it changes the security model.\n\nEnterprises in highly regulated industries finance, healthcare, government had to reassess:\n\n- Data classification models\n- Retention schedules\n- Access controls\n- Audit logging requirements\n\nWhile Microsoft provides enterprise-grade security in SharePoint Online, responsibility is shared. Enterprises that succeeded conducted compliance workshops before migration and mapped legacy controls to cloud equivalents.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Revalidate every compliance assumption in the new environment.\n\n## 6. User Training Determines Adoption\n\nYou can execute a flawless technical migration and still fail if users resist the change.\n\nLarge enterprises that experienced smooth transitions invested heavily in change management:\n\n- Role-based training sessions\n- Short, task-focused video tutorials\n- Internal champions or “power users”\n- Clear communication timelines\n\nImportantly, they highlighted benefits rather than focusing solely on system changes. Features like real-time co-authoring, mobile access, and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 tools resonated with employees.\n\nOrganizations that skipped this step often faced complaints like, “The old system was easier.”\n\n**Lesson learned:** Adoption is earned, not assumed.\n\n## 7. Phased Migration Beats Big Bang\n\nFor global enterprises with thousands of sites and terabytes of data, a single cutover weekend is risky.\n\nSuccessful migrations typically followed a phased approach:\n\n1. Pilot with a smaller department\n2. Gather feedback and refine processes\n3. Migrate high-value collaboration sites\n4. Transition remaining content in structured waves\n\nThis method reduced risk and allowed teams to troubleshoot issues before they scaled.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Slow and steady reduces disruption.\n\n## 8. Performance and Network Planning Matter More Than Expected\n\nWhen large volumes of data move to the cloud, network capacity becomes critical. Some enterprises discovered bandwidth limitations only after migration had begun.\n\nForward-looking organizations performed:\n\n- Network readiness assessments\n- Bandwidth capacity testing\n- Geographic performance reviews\n\nIn multinational enterprises, latency considerations were especially important. Planning ahead prevented productivity slowdowns during the transition.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Cloud performance still depends on your network reality.\n\n## 9. Executive Sponsorship Accelerates Success\n\nIn large enterprises, visible executive sponsorship can make or break digital initiatives.\n\nWhen senior leaders actively supported the migration communicating its importance and modeling new collaboration behaviors employees followed suit.\n\nWithout executive endorsement, migrations risk being perceived as another IT upgrade rather than a strategic transformation.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Leadership visibility drives cultural change.\n\n## 10. The Migration Is Only the Beginning\n\nPerhaps the most important realization is this: migration is not the finish line.\n\nEnterprises that viewed SharePoint Online as a dynamic platform continuously optimized and governed achieved greater ROI. They regularly reviewed:\n\n- Site usage analytics\n- Storage growth\n- Security configurations\n- User feedback\n\nCloud environments evolve quickly. New features and integrations emerge frequently within Microsoft 365. Organizations that remain agile continue to unlock value long after migration day.\n\n**Lesson learned:** Think long-term digital workplace strategy, not one-time migration.\n\nMigrating to SharePoint Online is a major milestone for large enterprises, but it’s not just a technical move it’s a cultural, operational, and strategic transformation.\n\nThe most successful organizations didn’t simply transfer data. They reimagined collaboration, modernized outdated processes, strengthened governance, and invested in user adoption.\n\nIf there’s one overarching takeaway, it’s this: treat migration as an opportunity, not a task.\n\nWhen approached thoughtfully, the shift to SharePoint Online can become the foundation for a smarter, more connected enterprise.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/migrating-to-sharepoint-online-lessons-learned-from-large-enterprises/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/migrating-to-sharepoint-online-lessons-learned-from-large-enterprises/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/migrating-to-sharepoint-online-lessons-learned-from-large-enterprises/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/migrating-to-sharepoint-online-lessons-learned-from-large-enterprises/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/migrating-to-sharepoint-online-lessons-learned-from-large-enterprises/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Extra posts:\n\n[!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/googletoSPMigration-150x150.jpg)A Complete Guide to Migrating from Google Sites to SharePoint Online](https://dellenny.com/migrating-from-google-sites-to-sharepoint-online/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sharepoint1-150x150.webp)Create SharePoint Online Site from SharePoint Online Admin](https://dellenny.com/create-sharepoint-online-site-from-sharepoint-online-admin/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SPOptimization-150x150.jpg)Performance Optimization Tips for Large SharePoint Sites](https://dellenny.com/performance-optimization-tips-for-large-sharepoint-sites/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/migration4-150x150.webp)Free SharePoint Migration tool to SharePoint Online and Office 365](https://dellenny.com/free-sharepoint-migration-tool-to-sharepoint-online-and-office-365/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/spadmin1-150x150.png)New SharePoint Online Admin Center](https://dellenny.com/new-sharepoint-online-admin-center/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/spfololowsites3-150x150.webp)Follow SharePoint Online Sites](https://dellenny.com/follow-sharepoint-online-sites/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYou must be [logged in](https://dellenny.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fdellenny.com%2Fmigrating-to-sharepoint-online-lessons-learned-from-large-enterprises%2F) to post a comment.\n\n%d",
