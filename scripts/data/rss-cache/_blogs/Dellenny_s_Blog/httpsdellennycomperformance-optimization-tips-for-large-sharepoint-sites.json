What starts as a fast, responsive collaboration platform can slowly turn into a sluggish system with long page load times, delayed search results, and frustrated users. Large SharePoint sites—especially those with thousands of users, massive document libraries, and complex customizations—need deliberate performance optimization to stay healthy.\n\nThe good news? Most performance problems are predictable and fixable. In this post, we’ll walk through **practical, technical performance optimization tips for large SharePoint sites**, covering architecture, content management, search, customizations, and ongoing monitoring.\n\nWhether you’re running **SharePoint Online** or **SharePoint Server (on-premises)**, these best practices will help keep your environment fast, scalable, and user-friendly.\n\n## 1. Start with a Scalable Information Architecture\n\nPerformance optimization begins long before users complain—it starts with how your site is designed.\n\n### Key Best Practices\n\n- **Avoid flat site structures** with too many subsites under one root.\n- Use **hub sites** to group related sites instead of deep subsite hierarchies.\n- Break large business units into **multiple site collections** where possible.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\nLarge site collections with excessive subsites can cause:\n\n- Slower permission checks\n- Longer page render times\n- Increased complexity during upgrades and migrations\n\nA well-planned architecture distributes content and load more evenly across SharePoint.\n\n## 2. Optimize Large Lists and Libraries (This Is Critical)\n\nLarge lists and document libraries are one of the most common causes of poor SharePoint performance.\n\n### Technical Steps\n\n1. **Enable Indexed Columns**\n- Index frequently used columns such as `Created`\n, `Modified` , `Status` , or `Category` .\n- Index columns used in filters, views, and metadata navigation.\n2. **Avoid the List View Threshold Trap**\n- Stay under **5,000 items per view**.\n- Use filtered views that rely on indexed columns.\n3. **Use Folders Carefully**\n- Folders can help with organization, but don’t rely on them as a performance fix.\n- Metadata-based navigation is usually better.\n4. **Split Very Large Libraries**\n- Libraries with 100,000+ items should be split by year, department, or content type.\n\nUnder Library setting:\n\n![](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-11-1024x227.png)\n### Why It Matters\n\nEvery unindexed query forces SharePoint to scan more items, increasing load times and risking throttling—especially in SharePoint Online.\n\n## 3. Reduce Page Load Time with Modern Pages\n\nModern SharePoint pages are faster—but they can still be misused.\n\n### Optimization Tips\n\n- Limit the number of **web parts per page** (especially custom ones).\n- Avoid loading multiple data-heavy web parts on a single page.\n- Prefer **out-of-the-box web parts** over custom SPFx solutions when possible.\n- Use **lazy loading** techniques in SPFx web parts.\n\n### Technical Insight\n\nEach web part adds:\n\n- Additional API calls\n- JavaScript execution\n- Rendering overhead\n\nThe fewer moving parts on a page, the faster it loads.\n\n## 4. Optimize Customizations and SPFx Solutions\n\nCustom code is powerful—but it’s also one of the biggest performance risks.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- Audit all **SPFx web parts and extensions** regularly.\n- Remove unused or redundant solutions.\n- Minimize API calls:\n- Batch REST calls\n- Use Microsoft Graph selectively\n- Avoid blocking JavaScript (no long-running scripts on page load)\n\n### Pro Tip\n\nRun browser developer tools and:\n\n- Check **network requests**\n- Identify slow scripts\n- Measure Time to Interactive (TTI)\n\nIf a custom solution slows down every page, it’s time to refactor or retire it.\n\n## 5. Improve Search Performance for Large Content Repositories\n\nSearch performance often degrades as content grows.\n\n### Technical Optimization Steps\n\n- Use **managed metadata** instead of free-text columns.\n- Create **search scopes and result sources** for targeted queries.\n- Refine search schema:\n- Map crawled properties to managed properties\n- Make frequently searched properties searchable and refinable\n- Clean up unused content—search indexes everything.\n\n### Why This Works\n\nEfficient metadata and schema configuration reduces index bloat and speeds up query processing.\n\n## 6. Control Permissions and Break Inheritance Carefully\n\nPermissions directly impact performance.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- Avoid excessive **unique permissions** at item or folder level.\n- Use **SharePoint groups** instead of assigning users individually.\n- Audit permissions regularly and remove unused groups.\n\n### Technical Impact\n\nEvery unique permission increases:\n\n- Security trimming complexity\n- Page rendering time\n- Search query evaluation cost\n\nLarge environments should keep permission structures as simple as possible.\n\n## 7. Leverage CDN and Caching\n\nStatic content doesn’t need to be reloaded every time.\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n\n- Enable **Office 365 CDN**for:\n- Images\n- CSS\n- JavaScript files\n- Use browser caching headers for static assets.\n- Minimize and bundle CSS/JS files in SPFx solutions.\n\n## 8. Monitor Performance Continuously (Not Just When Things Break)\n\nPerformance optimization is not a one-time task.\n\n### Tools to Use\n\n- **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**\n- **SharePoint Usage Reports**\n- **Azure Application Insights** (for custom solutions)\n- **Page diagnostics for SharePoint**\n\n### What to Monitor\n\n- Page load times\n- API response times\n- Search query performance\n- User complaints and behavior patterns\n\nEarly detection prevents small issues from turning into major outages.\n\n## 9. Clean Up Content Regularly\n\nContent sprawl slows everything down.\n\n### Cleanup Strategy\n\n- Archive old documents to separate sites or external storage.\n- Apply **retention policies**.\n- Remove unused workflows, lists, and features.\n\n## Technical Steps\n\n## 1. Use Indexed Columns (This Is Mandatory)\n\nWithout indexed columns, SharePoint must scan the entire list—boom, threshold error.\n\n### Technical Steps\n\n1. Go to **List or Library Settings**\n2. Click **Indexed Columns**\n3. Click **Create a new index**\n4. Choose a column:\n- Created\n- Modified\n- Status\n- Department\n- Content Type\n5. Save\n\n### Rules to Remember\n\n- Index columns **before** the list grows large\n- Single-column indexes work best\n- Compound indexes help when filtering on multiple columns\n\n📌 **Why this works:** Indexed columns allow SQL to seek instead of scan, keeping queries efficient.\n\n## 2. Filter Views Using Indexed Columns Only\n\nA view without filters will try to load *everything*.\n\n### Correct Way to Create a View\n\n1. Go to **Create View**\n2. Choose **Standard View**\n3. Under **Filter**, set conditions like:\n- `Created is greater than [Today] - 365`\n- `Status equals Active`\n- `Department equals Finance`\n4. Ensure the filtered column is indexed\n\n### What NOT to Do\n\n❌ Filtering on non-indexed columns ❌ Using “Contains” on large text fields ❌ Sorting on unindexed columns\n\n📌 **Golden rule:** The **first filter applied must use an indexed column**.\n\n## 3. Use Date-Based Filtering (Best Practice)\n\nDate columns are perfect for large libraries.\n\n### Example: Year-Based Views\n\nCreate views like:\n\n- Documents – 2024\n- Documents – 2023\n- Documents – Older\n\n## 4. Enable Metadata Navigation and Filtering\n\nThis lets users filter *before* hitting the threshold.\n\n### Technical Setup\n\n1. Go to **List Settings**\n2. Click **Metadata navigation settings**\n3. Add indexed columns to:\n- Navigation Hierarchy\n- Key Filters\n4. Save\n\n### Result\n\n- SharePoint dynamically builds safe queries\n- Users can drill down without errors\n- No need to create dozens of static views\n\n📌 This feature is **specifically designed** to handle large lists.\n\n## 5. Limit Items Returned in Views\n\nYou can explicitly cap how many items load.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Edit a view\n2. Scroll to **Item Limit**\n3. Set:\n- Number of items to display: `100`\nor `500`\n- Display items in batches\n\n⚠ **Important:** This helps UX but **does NOT replace filtering**. If the underlying query still hits 5,000 items, you’ll still get blocked.\n\n## 6. Use Folders Strategically (But Don’t Abuse Them)\n\nFolders can help *if* used correctly.\n\n### Safe Folder Pattern\n\n- One top-level folder per year or department\n- Each folder contains fewer than 5,000 items\n\n### What to Avoid\n\n❌ Deep nested folders ❌ Dumping 50,000 items into one folder\n\n📌 Folders reduce query scope, but metadata is still more flexible long-term.\n\n## 7. Split the Library When It’s Too Large\n\nIf optimization fails, **split the data**.\n\n### Options\n\n- One library per year\n- One library per department\n- Archive old content to a separate site\n\n### Rule of Thumb\n\nIf a library exceeds **100,000 items**, splitting is usually the healthiest option.\n\n## 8. Use Search for Bulk Access (Bypasses Threshold)\n\nSearch does **not** use list view thresholds.\n\n### When to Use Search\n\n- Finding older documents\n- Cross-library queries\n- Bulk reporting\n\n### Technical Tip\n\nCreate **Search Result Pages** or **PnP Search Web Parts** for power users.\n\n## 9. Common Mistakes That Trigger Threshold Errors\n\n🚫 Sorting by non-indexed columns 🚫 Grouping views on large lists 🚫 Using calculated columns in filters 🚫 Applying OR conditions on non-indexed fields 🚫 Power Automate flows querying entire libraries\n\n## Quick Technical Checklist\n\n✔ Indexed columns created ✔ Views filtered on indexed fields ✔ No unfiltered default views ✔ Metadata navigation enabled ✔ Item limit set (optional)\n\nLarge SharePoint sites don’t become slow overnight. Performance issues build up over time through poor architecture, oversized libraries, unmanaged customizations, and unchecked content growth.\n\nBy focusing on:\n\n- Smart information architecture\n- Optimized lists and libraries\n- Lean customizations\n- Search tuning\n- Continuous monitoring\n\nYou can keep even the largest SharePoint environments fast, scalable, and enjoyable to use.\n\nPerformance optimization isn’t about one magic fix—it’s about consistent, thoughtful maintenance.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/performance-optimization-tips-for-large-sharepoint-sites/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/performance-optimization-tips-for-large-sharepoint-sites/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/performance-optimization-tips-for-large-sharepoint-sites/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/performance-optimization-tips-for-large-sharepoint-sites/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/performance-optimization-tips-for-large-sharepoint-sites/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Extra posts:\n\n[!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/spfololowsites3-150x150.webp)Follow SharePoint Online Sites](https://dellenny.com/follow-sharepoint-online-sites/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/sharepointperfromance-150x150.jpg)Leveraging SharePoint for Performance Tracking Monitoring Team and Project Progress](https://dellenny.com/leveraging-sharepoint-for-performance-tracking-monitoring-team-and-project-progress/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/googletoSPMigration-150x150.jpg)A Complete Guide to Migrating from Google Sites to SharePoint Online](https://dellenny.com/migrating-from-google-sites-to-sharepoint-online/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/migration4-150x150.webp)Microsoft SharePoint Migration Tool now supports SharePoint Server 2010 available](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-sharepoint-migration-tool-now-supports-sharepoint-server-2010-available/) [!\\[\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1088Sharepoint-150x150.jpg)SharePoint Framework (SPFx) The Modern Development Model for SharePoint](https://dellenny.com/sharepoint-framework-spfx-the-modern-development-model-for-sharepoint/) [!\\[Default Thumbnail\\](https://dellenny.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png)Best Travel Sites for Vacation Planning](https://dellenny.com/best-travel-sites-for-vacation-planning/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYou must be [logged in](https://dellenny.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fdellenny.com%2Fperformance-optimization-tips-for-large-sharepoint-sites%2F) to post a comment.\n\n%d",
