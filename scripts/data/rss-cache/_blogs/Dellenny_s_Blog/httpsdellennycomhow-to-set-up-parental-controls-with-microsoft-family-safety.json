But at the same time, it also opens the door to risks such as inappropriate content, cyberbullying, unhealthy screen time habits, and online strangers.\n\nThat is why parental controls are important. They help create a safe digital environment so children can benefit from technology while staying protected. One of the easiest and most trusted tools for parental control is **Microsoft Family Safety**.
