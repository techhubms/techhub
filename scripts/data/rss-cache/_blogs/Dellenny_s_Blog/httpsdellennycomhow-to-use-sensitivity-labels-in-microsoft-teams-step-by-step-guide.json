While this speed increases productivity, it also increases the risk of sharing sensitive information unintentionally. This is where **Sensitivity Labels in Microsoft Teams** become incredibly important.\n\nSensitivity labels help organizations protect data by controlling how information is accessed, shared, and stored. If you’re using Microsoft Teams and want to keep confidential conversations, files, and meetings secure, learning how to use sensitivity labels is essential.\n\nIn this blog , we’ll walk through **what sensitivity labels are**, **why they matter**, and **how to use sensitivity labels in Teams step by step**, even if you’re not a technical expert.\n\n## What Are Sensitivity Labels in Microsoft Teams?\n\nSensitivity labels are part of **Microsoft Purview Information Protection**. They allow organizations to classify and protect data based on its sensitivity level. In Microsoft Teams, sensitivity labels can control:\n\n- Who can access a team\n- Whether external users can join\n- If content can be shared\n- Meeting security settings\n- Data protection rules for files and chats\n\nFor example, a “Confidential” label can restrict guest access, while a “Public” label allows broader collaboration.\n\n## Why Sensitivity Labels Matter in Teams\n\nMicrosoft Teams is often used for discussions involving financial data, HR information, legal documents, and strategic plans. Without proper controls, sensitive information can easily fall into the wrong hands.\n\nHere’s why sensitivity labels are crucial:\n\n- **Prevent data leaks** by limiting access\n- **Meet compliance requirements** (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO, etc.)\n- **Standardize security** across teams\n- **Educate users** on data sensitivity\n- **Protect files automatically** in SharePoint and OneDrive\n\nSimply put, sensitivity labels bring **clarity and control** to collaboration.\n\n## Prerequisites Before Using Sensitivity Labels\n\nBefore you start using sensitivity labels in Teams, make sure the following are in place:\n\n- Microsoft 365 subscription that includes **Microsoft Purview**\n- Sensitivity labels created and published by an **admin**\n- Microsoft Teams updated to the latest version\n- Appropriate user permissions\n\nIf labels are not visible in Teams, your Microsoft 365 administrator may need to enable them first.\n\n## Step-by-Step: How To Use Sensitivity Labels in Teams\n\n### Step 1: Create Sensitivity Labels (Admin Task)\n\nThis step is usually done by a Microsoft 365 administrator.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-20.png?fit=1024%2C534&amp;ssl=1)\n1. Go to **Microsoft Purview portal** [https://purview.microsoft.com/](https://purview.microsoft.com/)\n2. Select **Information Protection**\n3. Click **Sensitivity labels**\n4. Choose **Create a label**\n5. Name the label (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential)\n6. Configure protection settings like:\n- Encryption\n- Access restrictions\n- Content marking\n7. Save and publish the label\n\nOnce published, the label becomes available in Microsoft Teams.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-21.png?fit=1024%2C477&amp;ssl=1)\n### Step 2: Enable Sensitivity Labels for Teams\n\nAfter creating labels, ensure they’re enabled for Teams:\n\n1. In Microsoft Purview, open the label\n2. Go to **Groups & Sites settings**\n3. Turn on **Microsoft Teams support**\n4. Configure:\n- Privacy (Public or Private)\n- Guest access\n- External sharing\n5. Save changes\n\nThis ensures the label works specifically within Teams environments.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-22.png?fit=1024%2C415&amp;ssl=1)\n### Step 3: Apply a Sensitivity Label When Creating a Team\n\nWhen users create a new Team:\n\n1. Open **Microsoft Teams**\n2. Click **Join or create a team**\n3. Select **Create team**\n4. Choose **From scratch** or **From a group**\n5. Before finalizing, select a **Sensitivity label**\n6. Complete team setup\n\nThe label will automatically enforce the security rules defined by the admin.\n\n### Step 4: Change Sensitivity Label for an Existing Team\n\nIf the data sensitivity changes over time, you can update the label:\n\n1. Open the Team in Microsoft Teams\n2. Click the **three dots (More options)**\n3. Select **Edit team**\n4. Choose a new **Sensitivity label**\n5. Save changes\n\n⚠️ Note: You must be a team owner to change labels.\n\n### Step 5: Use Sensitivity Labels in Teams Meetings\n\nSensitivity labels can also be applied to meetings:\n\n1. Schedule a meeting in **Teams Calendar**\n2. Open **Meeting options**\n3. Select a **Sensitivity label**\n4. The label controls:\n- Lobby settings\n- Recording permissions\n- Chat access\n- Screen sharing\n\nThis is especially useful for confidential or executive meetings.\n\n### Step 6: Protect Files Shared in Teams Automatically\n\nWhen a Team has a sensitivity label:\n\n- Files shared in chats are stored in **OneDrive**\n- Files in channels are stored in **SharePoint**\n- The same sensitivity label is automatically applied to these files\n\nThis ensures consistent data protection without manual effort.\n\n## Best Practices for Using Sensitivity Labels in Teams\n\nTo get the most value from sensitivity labels:\n\n- Use **clear, simple label names**\n- Avoid creating too many labels\n- Train employees on when to use each label\n- Regularly review label settings\n- Combine labels with **DLP policies**\n\nA well-planned labeling strategy makes security easier, not harder.\n\n## Common Issues and Troubleshooting\n\n**Labels not showing in Teams?**\n\n- Wait up to 24 hours after publishing\n- Check admin permissions\n- Ensure Teams support is enabled for labels\n\n**Can users override labels?**\n\n- Only if admins allow it\n\n**Do labels affect performance?**\n\n- No noticeable impact on Teams performance\n\nSensitivity labels in Microsoft Teams are a powerful way to protect your organization’s data without disrupting collaboration. By clearly defining access rules and automating protection, they reduce human error and improve compliance.\n\nWhether you’re managing a small team or a large enterprise, implementing sensitivity labels is a smart step toward secure and organized teamwork.\n\nStart small, educate your users, and let Microsoft Teams do the heavy lifting for data protection.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-sensitivity-labels-in-microsoft-teams-step-by-step-guide/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-sensitivity-labels-in-microsoft-teams-step-by-step-guide/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-sensitivity-labels-in-microsoft-teams-step-by-step-guide/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-sensitivity-labels-in-microsoft-teams-step-by-step-guide/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-sensitivity-labels-in-microsoft-teams-step-by-step-guide/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[Microsoft 365](https://dellenny.com/tag/microsoft-365-2/ \"Microsoft 365\")[Microsoft Teams](https://dellenny.com/tag/microsoft-teams/ \"Microsoft Teams\")\n\n[previousHow to Manage Teams Permissions and Privacy Settings](https://dellenny.com/how-to-manage-teams-permissions-and-privacy-settings/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYou must be [logged in](https://dellenny.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fdellenny.com%2Fhow-to-use-sensitivity-labels-in-microsoft-teams-step-by-step-guide%2F) to post a comment.\n\n%d",
