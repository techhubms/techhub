One of my favorites is: *“So… what exactly are you doing?”*\n\nGiven the world has changed quite a bit these last few years, a lot of us developers are now periodically working from home. Opinions on whether that’s good or bad are mixed, but that is not what I wanted to talk about here. Given this situation, I was confronted with a new kind of confounding question: “what are you doing?”.\n\n## What ARE you doing?\n\nTo clarify, I’m not talking about what we (as developers) are doing on a business-functional, enterprise or consultancy level, but what we are literally doing when writing/creating applications. Actually writing *words* that compile into something that can be ran and that *does a thing*.\n\nI’ve mostly been working on web applications, meaning I mostly have my VSCode or Visual Studio open. When my girlfriend, family member or random home intruder walks past me when I’m working at home, that is what they see. A dark screen full of characters.\n\nObviously, the go-to depiction of this is the following (at least for us millennials):\n\n![The Matrix Gif](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-1.png?width=330&amp;height=330&amp;name=undefined-1.png)\n\n(And let’s be honest, that is downright how we want to see ourselves.)\n\n## Seriously, what are you doing?\n\nBefore, when we were working at the office almost exclusively, these kinds of questions didn’t arise, because we were surrounded by people who were at least somewhat tech-savvy.\n\nThe first time I got the question, I started explaining enthusiastically:\n\n“Ok, so here is my function that is rendering HTML based on the amount of entities I got from my database, conditionally adding a CSS class based on the state and the order in which they should be shown. This button updates the database entry and sends an update event to my Function App, which in turn notifies the customers back office…”\n\nAt this point, the person was looking at the ceiling, their eyes moving suspiciously high up behind their eyelids, their arms wide and hands raising to the ceiling while humming mantras and drooling.\n\nFair enough. I don’t understand much about finance, fashion, construction, cars, or dancing either. There’s a lot more I *don’t* know than I do.\n\n![But why | Y Tho | Know Your Meme](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-2.png?width=285&amp;height=330&amp;name=undefined-2.png)\n\n(Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.)\n\n## Why do we do this to ourselves?\n\nAs time went on, my partner kind of got to the point where she understands what I’m doing, although she still says I’m super weird to want to do this stuff for a living.\n\nSometimes, I wonder about that too:\n\n![A screenshot of a phone](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-3.png?width=252&amp;height=621&amp;name=undefined-3.png)\n\n*YAML pipelines.*\n\n![A screenshot of a computer](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-52-3278-AM.png?width=420&amp;height=456&amp;name=undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-52-3278-AM.png)\n\n*Failing bicep deployments.*\n\n![how to fix 'there were build errors, would you like to continue and run ...'](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-4.png?width=504&amp;height=378&amp;name=undefined-4.png)\n\n*Inaccurate build errors*\n\n![\\[Bug\\] Font Awesome and Text Alignment · Issue #17 · erohtar/Dasherr ...](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-32-0186-AM.png?width=513&amp;height=180&amp;name=undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-32-0186-AM.png)\n\n*Fixing alignment issues*\n\n![Text Box 1](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-44-0675-AM.png?width=683&amp;height=29&amp;name=undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-44-0675-AM.png)![Text Box 2](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-44-3256-AM.png?width=685&amp;height=79&amp;name=undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-27-44-3256-AM.png)\n\n## The flicker\n\nAt some point during all of this, you get a kind of flickering sense.\n\n*If I fix this last little thingy, I think I got it.*\n\nYou hit CTRL+S. The build starts. Your eye twitches.\n\nYour fingers set in motion the series of actions that you've done an unfathomable number of times before, in order to start the next attempt.\n\n*Whatever it is you're doing, starts building/compiling/deploying…*\n\nYour \"normal\" eye starts imitating the behavior of its twitchy counterpart. But then…\n\n![Oh Yeah Meme](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-28-51-3780-AM.png?width=321&amp;height=399&amp;name=undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-28-51-3780-AM.png)\n\nSuddenly, everything in the world starts making sense. You feel like the single greatest technological king in the galaxy because your alternate icon now aligns with the three above it.\n\n![Bugs Bunny King Meme](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-29-06-3809-AM.png?width=720&amp;height=411&amp;name=undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-29-06-3809-AM.png)\n\n## So SRSLY, why?\n\nBecause achieving the thing you set out to do is rewarding. That's it.\n\nAfter you’ve watched Azure DevOps fail for the 47th time, the one successful run feels euphoric. After a Bicep template finally deploys cleanly, you want to deploy ten more just to prove it wasn’t luck.\n\nBut the reward isn’t just personal ego. At Zure there is a collective urge to tackle and overcome challenges. When one of us succeeds, everyone shares in that satisfaction.\n\n![Congrats Happy For You Meme](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-29-49-2252-AM.png?width=585&amp;height=594&amp;name=undefined-Oct-31-2025-06-29-49-2252-AM.png)\n\n(This meme will never be not funny.)\n\nSo when I try to explain this whole thing to someone, it usually ends like this:\n\n“So… money?”\n\n“Yeah. Sure. Let’s go with that.”\n\n![Wouter Vercruysse](https://zure.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Profile%20pictures/Wouter%20Vercruysse.jpg?width=608&amp;name=Wouter%20Vercruysse.jpg)\n\nWouter Vercruysse\n\nWouter has worked in back- and frontend development for 6 years, while also engaging in guilds and teamwork.
