Custom applications used the API and associated libraries to authenticate users from their business or partner organizations.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nIn 2020, a [post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/update-your-applications-to-use-microsoft-authentication-library-and-microsoft-g/1257363) from Alex Simons, now corporate VP of cloud services and enterprise security, said the Azure AD Graph API and Azure AD Authentical Library (ADAL) would be feature-frozen from June 2022, in favour of the Microsoft Graph API and Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) which have a richer set of features and support for Microsoft (personal) as well as Entra ID accounts.\n\nADAL end of support was later postponed until June 2023 [because of](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/azure-ad-change-management-simplified/2967456) “feedback about the challenges of migrating such a critical dependency,” after which Microsoft said “while ADAL apps may continue to work, no support or security fixes will be provided.”\n\nThe new post states that affected applications will no longer work at all once the deadline is reached. In addition, organizations can “expect one to two temporary outage tests of 8-24hrs in duration” between July and September.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nWhy outage tests? We presume that the company is worried about customer or perhaps internal app breakage when the API is removed, and that the temporary outage could smoke these problems out before it is too late.\n\nAlthough Microsoft has come up with migration guides, migration is not always easy. One issue is knowing which applications use these libraries. API usage should show up in [Microsoft Entra Recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/recommendation-migrate-to-microsoft-graph-api) in the Entra ID admin center. The company has devised a [sign-ins workbook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity-platform/howto-get-list-of-all-auth-library-apps) introduced one year ago, which shows sign-in information for applications including which library is used.\n\nThere are both Microsoft and third-party applications which use ADAL or the Azure AD Graph API, including PowerShell modules and libraries such as Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault and Microsoft.Azure.Management.Automation. It is not obvious that these packages, which are also deprecated, depend on the API which is being removed. This is why viewing the API activity centrally is the only reliable way to identify them.\n\nMany older SDKs are impacted, including for .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android and iOS.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nDevelopers tasked with migrating applications, or creating new ones, that use Entra ID for authentication can expect to navigate some complexity. Microsoft has come up with extensive sample code such as [this for ASP.NET Core web applications](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2), for using the new up-to-date libraries, and while the existence of these samples is welcome, it also shows some annoying limitations and complications, and that some features require premium Entra ID subscriptions.\n\nDespite these issues, having applications that use Entra ID for authentication and authorization is a big win for customers of Microsoft’s cloud, since it allows central management of this aspect of security.\n\n[development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F30%2Fmicrosoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api%2F101141 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F30%2Fmicrosoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api%2F101141 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F30%2Fmicrosoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api%2F101141 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Microsoft%20to%20finally%20expunge%20the%20Azure%20AD%20Graph%20API%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F30%2Fmicrosoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api%2F101141 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F30%2Fmicrosoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api%2F101141&title=Microsoft%20to%20finally%20expunge%20the%20Azure%20AD%20Graph%20API https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Microsoft%20to%20finally%20expunge%20the%20Azure%20AD%20Graph%20API%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F30%2Fmicrosoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api%2F101141\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
