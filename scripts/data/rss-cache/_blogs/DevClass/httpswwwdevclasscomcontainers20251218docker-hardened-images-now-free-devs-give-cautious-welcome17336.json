The images have an Apache 2.0 license and Docker promises “no licensing surprises.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nAn enterprise license is required for additional features including compliance with FIPS (federal information processing standards) and DoD STIG (department of defense secure technical implementation guide), available for some but not all hardened images, customization, and 7-day critical CVE remediation.\n\nHardened images are pulled from Docker Hub, but the catalog of definitions is [on GitHub](https://github.com/docker-hardened-images/catalog), where users can also request new images. Since the announcement yesterday, a number of new hardened images have already been requested.\n\nDHI were introduced as a [commercial offering in May 2025](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-hardened-images/). Images are built on Alpine or Debian Linux, and typically have no shell, no package manager, and run as a non-root user. The minimalist approach means that migration from non-hardened images requires some changes to the workflow. The hardened image for PHP, for example, comes with a minimal set of packages. Adding further packages can be done using a -dev version of the image to install the packages, and then copying the resulting artifacts to the runtime variant.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nHardened images do not restrict what you add to them, though the modifications may reduce their security. “That’s where scanners like Docker Scout, Trivy, Grype, and more come in to review the complete image that you have built,” [explained](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305140) a Docker employee on Hacker News.\n\nAnother issue is debugging. Since there is no shell, developers may need a tool such as Docker Debug, which provides a shell and tools such as editors and process viewers without modifying the hardened image. Docker Debug requires Docker Desktop, which requires a subscription in most business cases.\n\nThe benefit though is substantial, with the hardened images being both smaller and more secure than the general-purpose equivalents. Docker claims up to a 95 percent reduction in attack surface.\n\nInitial reaction is positive, though some are wary of the future, based on Docker’s history of reducing its free offerings and pushing subscriptions. “It’s free for now, just like registries were ‘free’ and docker desktop was free… until they weren’t,” said [one](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305222).\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nEarlier this year, Bitnami (part of VMWare) withdrew its free public catalog of images, which were free prior to Broadcom’s acquisition of VMWare, suggesting that users shift to a subscription to Bitnami Secure Images at $50,000 or more annually. Bitnami [said](https://community.broadcom.com/tanzu/blogs/beltran-rueda-borrego/2025/08/18/how-to-prepare-for-the-bitnami-changes-coming-soon) in its defense that “Bitnami has been the Jenkins of the internet for many years, but this has become unsustainable. Operating a build pipeline and OCI registry for the general public is very expensive.”\n\nA comment from Docker [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46305233) that DHI are sustainable because “we do offer an enterprise tier for companies that need things like contractual continuous patching SLAs, regulated-industry variants (FIPS, etc.), and secure customizations with full provenance and attestations. Those things carry very real ongoing costs, so keeping them in Enterprise allows us to make the entire hardened catalog free for the community.”\n\nIt may be hard though to use DHI in a business without some level of Docker subscription, since a login is required, alongside needing Docker Desktop for some tools.\n\n[security](/tag/security) [containers](/tag/containers)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F18%2Fdocker-hardened-images-now-free-devs-give-cautious-welcome%2F1733653 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F18%2Fdocker-hardened-images-now-free-devs-give-cautious-welcome%2F1733653 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F18%2Fdocker-hardened-images-now-free-devs-give-cautious-welcome%2F1733653 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Docker%20Hardened%20Images%20now%20free%2C%20devs%20give%20cautious%20welcome%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F18%2Fdocker-hardened-images-now-free-devs-give-cautious-welcome%2F1733653 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F18%2Fdocker-hardened-images-now-free-devs-give-cautious-welcome%2F1733653&title=Docker%20Hardened%20Images%20now%20free%2C%20devs%20give%20cautious%20welcome https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Docker%20Hardened%20Images%20now%20free%2C%20devs%20give%20cautious%20welcome%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F18%2Fdocker-hardened-images-now-free-devs-give-cautious-welcome%2F1733653\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
