At the time, Peter Zaitsev, CEO of database solutions company Percona, [speculated on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/peterzaitsev_mysql-opensource-activity-7370819205702664193-5gPl) that it could be “another significant step by Oracle towards slowly killing MySQL Community edition.”\n\nOracle acquired MySQL as part of Sun Microsystems in 2010. Work on the database manager continued at a steady pace in the early years after the acquisition, despite the code being forked by Michael (“Monty”) Widenius, the original creator of MySQL, as MariaDB.\n\nSince 2019 though, the number of commits has declined year by year, as [charted](https://www.percona.com/blog/analyzing-the-heartbeat-of-the-mysql-server-a-look-at-repository-statistics/) by Julia Vural, software engineering manager at Percona. In 2025, commits fell to their lowest number since the beginnings of the project in 2000/2001.\n\n![Chart showing steep decline in the number of MySQL commits on GitHub](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Picture2-1024x627.png)Commits to MySQL charted year by year by Julia Vural at Percona\n\nOracle markets other products based on MySQL, including an enterprise edition with proprietary extensions, a distributed Cluster edition, and the cloud-hosted Heatwave. Lack of activity in the open source repository may mean that the company is mainly focused on these proprietary versions. The open source MySQL is licensed under GPL (GNU General Public License) version 2.\n\nOtto Kekäläinen, formerly a software development manager at AWS working on RDS (Relational Database Service), and before that CEO of MariaDB Foundation, [posted](https://optimizedbyotto.com/post/reasons-to-stop-using-mysql/) on the decline in git commits for MySQL, claiming that MySQL is “open source only by license, but not as a project.” He recommended that developers switch to other database managers such as MariaDB or PostgreSQL.\n\nPostgreSQL is today’s developer favorite among open source database servers, with a strong community of contributors. Key PostgreSQL assets are owned by a non-profit community association, and the project is supported by non-profit organizations in Europe and the US. That said, migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL can be challenging thanks to many differences in the SQL dialect and database structure.\n\nDespite worries about its open source future, MySQL remains among the most popular database engines. In April last year, Microsoft retired its Azure database for MariaDB in favour of MySQL, giving no clear reason but [stating](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/mariadb/migrate/whats-happening-to-mariadb) that “the MariaDB offering needs to be retired and upgraded with a new architecture.”\n\nMeasuring the popularity of a database engine is not easy. Users of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack may not be aware of whether MySQL or MariaDB is in use by a WordPress hosting provider, for example. DB Engines has a ranking system which places Oracle first and MySQL second, but this is not based on a count of installations, but rather on general interest such as the number of searches and social media posts. Discussion of the decline of MySQL might actually improve its DB Rankings place.\n\nThe most recent [Stack Overflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology#most-popular-technologies-database-prof), which looks at what professional developers say they are using, ranks PostgreSQL top by a wide margin, followed by MySQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nThe developers of SQLite [reckon](https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) it to be the most widely deployed database with upwards of one trillion databases “in active use.”\n\nMySQL is not going away, but usage is likely to decline if the open source project remains moribund.\n\n[## Fly.io introduces Sprites: lightweight, persistent VMs to isolate agentic AI](https://devclass.com/2026/01/13/fly-io-introduces-sprites-lightweight-persistent-vms-to-isolate-agentic-ai/)[## Tailwind Labs lays off 75 percent of its engineers thanks to 'brutal impact' of AI](https://devclass.com/2026/01/08/tailwind-labs-lays-off-75-percent-of-its-engineers-thanks-to-brutal-impact-of-ai/)[## Microsoft open sources XAML Studio amid developer discontent with Visual Studio designers](https://devclass.com/2026/01/07/microsoft-open-sources-xaml-studio-amid-developer-discontent-with-visual-studio-designers/)[## Ruby 4.0 released – but its best new features are not production ready](https://devclass.com/2026/01/06/ruby-4-0-released-but-its-best-new-features-are-not-production-ready/)[## Dramatic drop in Stack Overflow questions as devs look elsewhere for help](https://devclass.com/2026/01/05/dramatic-drop-in-stack-overflow-questions-as-devs-look-elsewhere-for-help/)[## GitHub to charge for self-hosted runners from March 2026](https://devclass.com/2025/12/17/github-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026/)[## Cursor AI editor gets visual designer – but bugs and ever-changing UI irk developers](https://devclass.com/2025/12/16/cursor-ai-editor-gets-visual-designer-but-bugs-and-ever-changing-ui-irk-developers/)[## Rust boosted by permanent adoption for Linux kernel code](https://devclass.com/2025/12/15/rust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code/)[## VS Code update brings agent overload, TypeScript 7 preview, and the end of IntelliCode](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/vs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode/)[## Research: AI can help or hinder software development, and old-style best practices make the differen...](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/research-ai-can-help-or-hinder-software-development-and-old-style-best-practices-make-the-difference/)[## JetBrains abandons Fleet IDE, pins hopes on forthcoming Air agentic development tool](https://devclass.com/2025/12/09/jetbrains-abandons-fleet-ide-pins-hopes-on-forthcoming-air-agentic-development-tool/)[## AWS shows Rust love at re:Invent: 10 times faster than Kotlin, one tenth the latency of Go](https://devclass.com/2025/12/08/aws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
