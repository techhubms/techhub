Windows is a multi-faceted platform which has both a classic Win32 API (now simply called the Windows API) which dates back to the early days of Windows, and a modern API which supports newer features of Windows including the WinUI user interface framework, Windows AI APIs, notifications and widgets.\n\nThis division is reflected in the existence of two Windows SDKs (software development kits), the classic Windows SDK and the modern Windows App SDK.\n\n![](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/winapi-1024x761.jpg)Windows has two SDKs, the classic Windows SDK and the modern Windows App SDK.\n\nHistorically most Windows developers have used Visual Studio, but given the need to support mobile platforms and Macs, cross-platform development is popular, where developers are more likely to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or other development tools. In this scenario, building applications that run on Windows is easy, but making use of modern Windows APIs is challenging, the result being applications that do not use many of the features available. This can be construed either as a problem for developers, whose applications are less rich than they could be, or a problem for Microsoft, as those applications do not show off Windows to best advantage.\n\nA large part of the problem is that some elements of the Windows App SDK can only be used by what Microsoft calls app packaging. “Many Windows extensibility features – including background tasks, notifications, live tiles, custom context menu extensions, and share targets – can be used by an app only if that app has package identity at runtime,” the docs [state](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/intro-pack-dep-proc). Achieving package identity requires not only a signed application but also one that is packaged using MSIX, the modern evolution of MSI (Microsoft Installer) packages. Visual Studio handles this for developing and debugging, but it is not so easy using other tools.\n\nUsing winapp, developers can type:\n\nwinapp create-debug-identity my-app.exe\n\nand the tool will manage creating package identity automatically. There is particular support for Electron, a framework for building cross-platform apps with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and which is also used by VS Code itself.\n\nThe initial developer reaction to winapp is telling, with as much bemusement as there is interest in taking advantage of the new tool. “I read it as WinApp and got excited. How disappointing,” [said one](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qk0vip/announcing_winapp_the_windows_app_development_cli/o13grha/). Others felt that there could be confusion between winapp and the new remote desktop client called Windows App.\n\nMicrosoft has something of an uphill battle even getting developers to use WinUI, let alone other modern APIs. “Check WinUI Github repo discussions and open issues to have an idea how bad it is,” said [another comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qk0vip/announcing_winapp_the_windows_app_development_cli/o13ep61/) on the news.\n\nThese comments show, perhaps, that Microsoft is correct in thinking that modern Windows desktop development is too complicated. While the new tool may help a little, it will not fix the underlying problem.\n\n[## VS Code tasks config file abused to run malicious code](https://devclass.com/2026/01/22/vs-code-tasks-config-file-abused-to-run-malicious-code/)[## LLVM project adopts \"human in the loop\" policy following AI-driven nuisance contributions](https://devclass.com/2026/01/21/llvm-project-adopts-human-in-the-loop-policy-following-ai-driven-nuisance-contributions/)[## Microsoft updates React Native for Windows.
