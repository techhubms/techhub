It was the main use for .NET Interactive, a project whose future must now also be in doubt.\n\nMicrosoft’s Claudia Regio, from the Platform and Tools team, made the [deprecation announcement](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/issues/4163) on GitHub yesterday, giving just over one month’s notice, with deprecation set for March 27th.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe extension will remain installed, she said, but \"bug fixes and support will end immediately\" and \"issues in this repository related to the Polyglot Notebooks extension will be closed as not planned,\" as will issues \"related to using .NET Interactive as a kernel in other Jupyter frontends.\"\n\n\"This is a disaster for us. We use polyglot Notebooks for All our data science courses. All the people saying do not trust or rely on Microsoft were sadly right again,\" [remarked](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1r28bdg/microsoft_discontinues_polyglot_notebooks_c/o4y6q7o/) a user on Reddit.\n\nThe deprecation has surfaced another long-standing issue, which is that Azure Data Studio (ADS), a fork of VS Code specifically for working with SQL databases, is set for retirement at the end of this month. The main replacement for ADS is meant to be the SQL Server extension for VS Code, but Polyglot Notebooks were documented as the recommended replacement for data analysts, as opposed to developers or DBAs (database administrators).\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n\"Given today’s announcement … what is the official guidance from Microsoft regarding a replacement for the T-SQL + markdown notebook functionality that existed in Azure Data Studio?\" [asked](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/issues/4164) another user, with the official response from Microsoft technical writer Randolph West being that \"there is no guidance at this time.\"\n\nWest added a frank comment, stating that \"I’m just as big a fan of Azure Data Studio as you are,\" but that \"as a result of the deprecation announcement for Polyglot Notebooks, I am legally bound to remove that recommendation.”\n\nRegio recommended using C# file-based apps, a feature of .NET 10 that enables a C# file to be run without setting up a project, as a replacement; but although useful for learning C#, this feature is not close to an equivalent.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nBoth ADSS and Polyglot Notebooks were well liked by users. Users raised an [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/issues/26289) asking for the retirement of ADS to be reconsidered, with comments such as \"Azure Data Studio is a beautiful, user-friendly experience. Trying to achieve the same thing in VS Code is incredibly clunky.\" The Polyglot Notebooks extension has over 1.8 million installs and a four star rating in the VS Code marketplace, unlike the [SQL Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql&amp;ssr=false#review-details) which has recent comments such as \"riddled with bugs … how is a tool that worked fine (ADS) being discontinued and this is being recommended as the alternative?\"\n\n\"While Polyglot Notebooks may be deprecated, our mission to make C# development delightful and accessible continues in our flagship products; we're carrying that work forward through C# Dev Kit and the next generation of AI-powered coding experiences,\" wrote Regio.\n\nUsers will be hard to convince. \"Polyglot notebooks are incredibly useful for prototyping stuff and demoing. Almost hard to believe that something so unique and useful is getting killed off like that,\" [said](https://old.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/1r26dbj/polyglot_notebooks_will_be_deprecated/o4ulhy7/) another comment.\n\n[visual studio code](/tag/visual%20studio%20code) [polyglot notebooks](/tag/polyglot%20notebooks) [microsoft](/tag/microsoft) [databases](/tag/databases) [azure data studio](/tag/azure%20data%20studio) [.net interactive](/tag/.net%20interactive)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdatabases%2F2026%2F02%2F14%2Fmicrosoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react%2F4091167 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdatabases%2F2026%2F02%2F14%2Fmicrosoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react%2F4091167 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdatabases%2F2026%2F02%2F14%2Fmicrosoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react%2F4091167 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Microsoft https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdatabases%2F2026%2F02%2F14%2Fmicrosoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react%2F4091167&title=Microsoft https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Microsoft\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
