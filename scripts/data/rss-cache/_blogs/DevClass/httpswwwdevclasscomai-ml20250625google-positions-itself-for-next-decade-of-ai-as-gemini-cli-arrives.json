It is a trend Google cannot afford to ignore, and Google’s Ryan Salva, senior director of product, told us in a briefing that Gemini CLI is distinctive because of its “unmatched usage limits,” which includes a 1 million token context windows, use of the Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM (large language model), and 1,000 model requests per day.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThere is also a paid option which uses an AI Studio or Vertex API key and adds features including policy and governance capabilities, choice of models, running agents in parallel, and no requirement to use Gemini activity to improve Google’s products.\n\nAdvantages of the CLI include the ability to use coding assistance with any editor or IDE, rather than just those for which a plugin is available, and an option to run multiple instances concurrently. Some developers also find the CLI more efficient.\n\nGemini CLI runs on Mac, Linux (including ChromeOS) and Windows; and unlike Claude Code or Codex, the Windows version is native rather than requiring WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Developers can configure it using a text file, gemini.md, at the root of a folder, setting context and other parameters. Gemini CLI will also automatically save context into gemini.md “when it finds details that should be longer lived,” said Tayor Mullen, senior staff engineer.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nCapabilities of Gemini CLI include writing code, debugging issues, managing projects, querying documentation, and explaining code. The tool also has access to MCP (model context protocol) servers, enabling agentic AI. The utility is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) under the Apache 2.0 license. It also integrates with the gcloud CLI, part of the Google Cloud SDK, and we presume that the company aims to monetize this product in part by steering developers towards deployment to Google Cloud. The demo we saw in a briefing was deployed automatically to Google Cloud Run.\n\nGoogle is also targeting general users including IT professionals, scientists, and anyone wanting to generate slides or images, for example.\n\nGemini CLI cannot yet be used with a local model, though Allen Hutchison, senior director AI developer, told us that the company hopes to use it with local models such as [Gemma](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/22/google_gemma_llms/) in future.\n\n![](https://image.devclass.com/120934.webp?imageId=120934&width=960&height=986&format=jpg)\n\nGemini CLI at work, complete with the tempting but risky option to “allow always”\n\nThe company asserted that security is a key focus of Gemini CLI. Two key features are that actions are subject to approval via a prompt – with an option to “allow always” – and sandboxing. On Mac Gemini CLI uses native macOS sandboxing, also known as Seatbelt, while on other platforms it can use a container such as Podman or Docker. Security remains a concern though. MCP is known to lack sufficient security safeguards, and [risks from prompt injection](https://devclass.com/2025/05/27/researchers-warn-of-prompt-injection-vulnerability-in-github-mcp-with-no-obvious-fix/) are inherently difficult to solve, particularly if less skilled users employ AI to write code or perform actions which they do not fully understand.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nGemini is available via an API as well as through Code Assist plugins for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and JetBrains IntelliJ-based IDEs, and the browser-based AI Studio. Access to Gemini CLI includes a Code Assist license.\n\n[Early reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ljzqxc/google_accidentally_published_the_gemini_cli_blog/) to Gemini CLI is mainly focused on how extensive the free tier is. “Huge, and will put lots of pressure on Anthropic,” said one commentor.\n\nThat said, Gemini’s existing Code Assist plugins have a mixed reputation so far, judging by comments on the JetBrains and VS Code marketplace. The [VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist&amp;ssr=false#review-details) has 900,000 installs but only a 2.5 star rating, with criticism such as “for code generation, this was a complete waste of time. The model behind the extension referenced functions and classes that didn’t exist, and even started generating tests for code that wasn’t part of my code base.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nAn advantage of the CLI is that it no longer depends on working within VS Code, which Microsoft gears specifically towards GitHub Copilot.\n\nGoogle’s Ryan J Salva’s [pitch](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7343628398084202496/) to the press at the briefing was: “we believe that these tools will dominate the way creators work in the next decade.” By giving away free AI compute the company hopes, perhaps, to achieve a strong position in this market from which it can later take advantage.\n\n[ai-ml](/tag/ai-ml) [development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F06%2F25%2Fgoogle-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier%2F1627809 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F06%2F25%2Fgoogle-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier%2F1627809 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F06%2F25%2Fgoogle-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier%2F1627809 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Google%20positions%20itself%20for%20 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F06%2F25%2Fgoogle-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier%2F1627809&title=Google%20positions%20itself%20for%20 https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Google%20positions%20itself%20for%20\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
