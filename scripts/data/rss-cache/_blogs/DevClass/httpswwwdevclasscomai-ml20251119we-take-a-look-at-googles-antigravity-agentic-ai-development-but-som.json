The developer’s task is to prompt, refine and verify the agent’s output.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nA distinctive feature of Antigravity is its agent manager window, which is the primary place for interacting with agents. The is one of what the team describes as surfaces. “There are three main surfaces on which you can get your work done,” said Google engineer Kevin Hou in an introductory video, these being the agent manager, the code editor, and the Chrome web browser, automated by Antigravity.\n\nAgent interaction is also possible in the editor, via a sidebar or from within the editor itself. The [docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/home) state that the in-editor AI features “do not get nearly as much use as the agent.”\n\nAgents generate artifacts, which can be any sort of output including markdown files, architecture diagrams, images, browser recordings and more. One example of an artifact is an implementation plan, which details proposals for code changes or even for a complete application, to be reviewed and amended by the developer before the changes are actioned.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n![Balancing security and productivity with settings that determine how much autonomy the agent is allowed](https://image.devclass.com/1683587.webp?imageId=1683587&width=960&height=470&format=jpg)\n\nBalancing security and productivity with settings that determine how much autonomy the agent is allowed\n\nThe extent of human review is determined by settings, which control whether every action has to be approved, or whether the agent itself can decide what needs approval. The default is agent-assisted development, where, Hou said, the LLM (large language model) will “automatically decide if something is worth our attention.”\n\nFrontend design includes access to Nano Banana, an image generation model developed by Google and released in August. Browser automation includes the ability for the agent to try out interactions such as completing input fields and reviewing the results, with screenshots that are presented to the developer.\n\nAnother feature highlighted by Google is the ability to parallelize work, instructing an agent to do some background research, for example, while also working on the application.\n\nPricing is not yet available, though a Team plan and Enterprise plan are tagged as coming soon. Individuals can currently use Antigravity for free, subject to a rate limit which refreshes every five hours. The exact way the limit is calculated is not specified, other than that it is based on the work done by the agent rather than the number of prompts. The LLMs on offer are Google Gemini 3, Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 or OpenAI GPT-OSS.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n![Early adopters have hit issues with credit exhaustion or provider overload](https://image.devclass.com/1683588.webp?imageId=1683588&width=960&height=556&format=jpg)\n\nEarly adopters have hit issues with credit exhaustion or provider overload\n\nWe tried Antigravity but we soon hit issues, with a message “Agent taking unexpectedly long to load.” The agent manager seems happy to display its busy icon forever, but clicking a button to go to the editor revealed a further message, “Agent terminated due to error” this being “model provider overload.” We were asked to try again later.\n\nOthers have found themselves soon running out of credits. “I start using it for my project and after about 20 mins – oh, no. Out of credits … I switched back to cursor,” said a [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45971152) on Hacker News. There is no mechanism currently for buying extra credits. AI processing is expensive, and once the product comes out of preview this may be a pricey tool to run in a development team.\n\nAntigravity is an incremental step towards providing tools for Ai-driven development, and views on its value will vary according to whether the notion of software development evolving into the orchestration of agents is embraced or resisted. Security is an issue, and the terms of use warn that “Antigravity is known to have certain security limitations.” Risks identified include data exfiltration and (presumably malicious) code execution. The terms advise avoiding processing sensitive data and verifying all actions taken by the agent – though one would have thought that if Google were serious about this, it would not have product defaults that give the agents substantial autonomy.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nRisks can be mitigated by using Antigravity in a sandboxed environment and increasing the amount of human review. One of the difficulties though is that the AI may write code or take actions that some developers do not fully understand, making human verification challenging. Prompt injection, where the AI draws on resources crafted to instruct the agent to perform malicious actions, is another risk.\n\nForking VS Code can also be a source of friction, particularly with extensions which for Antigravity come from the Open VSX registry, rather than from the better-supported Visual Studio Code marketplace.\n\nSome developers feel that Microsoft is falling behind on agentic development, making forks like Antigravity necessary. “If we’d have to wait for Microsoft to innovate on the Agent interaction, the ecosystem would move pretty slowly,” said one [Reddit comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1p0h78i/gemini_3_was_released_minutes_ago/npjg9px/).\n\nThen again, moving more slowly may be exactly what the AI ecosystem needs, considering the number of unsolved issues around security and reliability.\n\n[development](/tag/development) [ai-ml](/tag/ai-ml)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F11%2F19%2Fwe-take-a-look-at-googles-antigravity-agentic-ai-development-but-some-frustrations-for-early-adopters%2F1727764 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F11%2F19%2Fwe-take-a-look-at-googles-antigravity-agentic-ai-development-but-some-frustrations-for-early-adopters%2F1727764 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F11%2F19%2Fwe-take-a-look-at-googles-antigravity-agentic-ai-development-but-some-frustrations-for-early-adopters%2F1727764 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=We%20take%20a%20look%20at%20Google https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F11%2F19%2Fwe-take-a-look-at-googles-antigravity-agentic-ai-development-but-some-frustrations-for-early-adopters%2F1727764&title=We%20take%20a%20look%20at%20Google https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=We%20take%20a%20look%20at%20Google\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
