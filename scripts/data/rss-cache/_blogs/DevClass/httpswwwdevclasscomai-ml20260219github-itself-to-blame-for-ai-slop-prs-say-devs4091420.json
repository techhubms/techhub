According to Wolf, \"maintainers have always dealt with noisy inbound.\" Nevertheless, GitHub is introducing features to make AI slop easier to deal with, including PR deletion from the GitHub UI (user interface) which she said is coming soon.\n\nWolf also mentioned relevant features that have already shipped, including the ability to limit PRs to collaborators or disable them entirely. Maintainers can also enforce temporary interaction limits for specific users.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nFurther refinements are under consideration. Wolf mentioned criteria-based gating, such as requiring a PR to be linked to an existing issue, or defining other rules that contributions must meet. There is also the inevitable suggestion that AI can be used to fix the problem it created, via automated triage.\n\nWolf’s post follows the creation of an official GitHub discussion on the subject earlier this month, as we [reported](https://www.theregister.com/2026/02/03/github_kill_switch_pull_requests_ai/). A GitHub product manager contacted us to state that \"we don’t think counting AI-generated PRs is the right metric,\" showing again the tension between the company’s strong promotion of AI and the evidence of the damage it is doing to open source.\n\n[github](/tag/github) [ai-ml](/tag/ai-ml) [open source](/tag/open%20source)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F19%2Fgithub-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs%2F4091420 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F19%2Fgithub-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs%2F4091420 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F19%2Fgithub-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs%2F4091420 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Godot%20maintainers%20struggle%20with%20 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F19%2Fgithub-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs%2F4091420&title=Godot%20maintainers%20struggle%20with%20 https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Godot%20maintainers%20struggle%20with%20\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
