Only 3,862 questions were posted in December – a 78 percent drop from the previous year.\n\nAt its peak in early 2014, Stack Overflow received more than 200,000 questions per month.\n\nThe shift is clear: developers now turn to AI tools directly within their IDEs, bypassing both the hassle of forum posts and the risk of dismissive moderators. That second factor matters more than many realize as discussions of Stack Overflow’s decline invariably surface stories of hostile treatment. Responding to the recent statistics, [one developer put it bluntly](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1q3l83g/stackoverflow_questions_asked_per_month_over_time/nxlit6u/): “AI certainly accelerated the decline, but this is the result of consistently punishing users for trying to participate in your community. People were just happy to finally have a tool that didn’t tell them their questions were stupid.”\n\nThere are other perspectives on this. Moderation is difficult, and the site aims (with limited success) to have a smaller number of high quality questions rather than a constant stream of common queries. The result though is that the site has been respected rather than loved by many of its users, contributing to its decline now that it is less necessary.\n\n![](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/so-questions-1024x604.jpg)Number of Stack Overflow questions as reported by its [public query tool](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/edit/1928515#graph)\n\nSome in the Stack Overflow community argue that counting the number of questions is a poor metric. “When your goal is to have a ‘library of detailed, high-quality answers’, you don’t die because you run out of new attempts at questions,” [said](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/433879/3446199) one.\n\nThat said, a decline of nearly 80 percent in one year, on top of steep declines in previous years, is remarkable and suggests a change in developer behavior, such that Stack Overflow is no longer part of their workflow. The trend is reinforced by the desire of Google and others to keep users on their property rather than sending them to another site. AI is perfect for this as it learns from external data and regurgitates it locally – though with the caveat that it is sometimes wrong, and lacks the reasoned expert debate which can be found in the best Stack Overflow discussions.\n\nSome developers therefore worry about the long-term impact of losing Stack Overflow. “SO was by far the leading source of high quality answers to technical questions. What do LLMs [large language models] train off now?” [asked](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46483491) one in response to the latest data.\n\nThere is also an impact on those who track data on programming languages. The Redmonk Language ranking uses Stack Overflow for half of its data, with the other half coming from public GitHub repositories. “At this point half of the data feeding the programming language rankings is increasingly stale and of questionable value on a going-forward basis, and there is as of now no replacement public data set available,” [said](https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2025/06/18/stackoverflow/) analyst Rachel Stephens.\n\nStack Overflow has always been free for developers, with a business model based initially on recruitment and later on paid-for private versions of its collaboration software. This means that declining traffic does not correlate directly with revenue; and owner Prosus [reported](https://www.prosus.com/~/media/Files/P/prosus-corp-v2/results-reports-and-events-archive/latest-results/hy2026/hy2026-summary-consolidated-financial-statements.pdf) in its half-year results to 30 September 2025 that “Stack Overflow and GoodHabitz achieved revenue growth of 12 percent to US$95m, primarily driven by Stack Overflow’s performance.”\n\nLast month the company [introduced](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/02/introducing-stack-overflow-ai-assist-a-tool-for-the-modern-developer/) AI Assist as a “new entry point to our public platform.” It is AI but driven primarily by Stack Overflow data. The oddity here is that providing answers to Stack Overflow questions via generative AI tools [remains banned](https://stackoverflow.com/help/gen-ai-policy). “I had huge respect for Stack Overflow when you introduced ‘no AI’ policy back in 2022. And now you go ahead and do this. Just terrible,” [said](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/02/introducing-stack-overflow-ai-assist-a-tool-for-the-modern-developer/#NLAhTGq1yT9SA27LONfqDw) one comment.\n\nAlong with this confusion, the company may struggle to establish AI Assist when so many similar services are available, including those from tech giants such as Google, AWS, and Microsoft/GitHub.\n\n[## GitHub to charge for self-hosted runners from March 2026](https://devclass.com/2025/12/17/github-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026/)[## Cursor AI editor gets visual designer – but bugs and ever-changing UI irk developers](https://devclass.com/2025/12/16/cursor-ai-editor-gets-visual-designer-but-bugs-and-ever-changing-ui-irk-developers/)[## Rust boosted by permanent adoption for Linux kernel code](https://devclass.com/2025/12/15/rust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code/)[## VS Code update brings agent overload, TypeScript 7 preview, and the end of IntelliCode](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/vs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode/)[## Research: AI can help or hinder software development, and old-style best practices make the differen...](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/research-ai-can-help-or-hinder-software-development-and-old-style-best-practices-make-the-difference/)[## JetBrains abandons Fleet IDE, pins hopes on forthcoming Air agentic development tool](https://devclass.com/2025/12/09/jetbrains-abandons-fleet-ide-pins-hopes-on-forthcoming-air-agentic-development-tool/)[## AWS shows Rust love at re:Invent: 10 times faster than Kotlin, one tenth the latency of Go](https://devclass.com/2025/12/08/aws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go/)[## Akamai buys Fermyon for Wasm-based serverless functions – a possible answer to Cloudflare workers](https://devclass.com/2025/12/04/akamai-acquires-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers/)[## Bun JavaScript runtime acquired by Anthropic, tying its future to AI coding](https://devclass.com/2025/12/03/bun-javascript-runtime-acquired-by-anthropic-tying-its-future-to-ai-coding/)[## AWS Transform revamp uses AI to shift applications from Microsoft’s SQL Server](https://devclass.com/2025/12/02/aws-transform-revamp-uses-ai-to-shift-applications-from-microsofts-sql-server/)[## Zig project ditches GitHub for Codeberg but move could be costly](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/zig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly/)[## OCaml maintainers reject massive AI-generated pull request](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/ocaml-maintainers-reject-massive-ai-generated-pull-request/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
