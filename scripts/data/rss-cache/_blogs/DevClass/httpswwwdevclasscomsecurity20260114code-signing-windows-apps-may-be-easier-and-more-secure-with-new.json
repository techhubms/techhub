The service, which was previewed as Trusted Signing, enables Windows developers to deploy applications without them being blocked or interrupted by pop-up warnings.\n\nThe new service uses certificates that are renewed daily and valid for only 24 hours. When code is signed, it is securely time-stamped so that the application remains signed after the certificate itself has expired, unless the certificate is revoked. The service costs $9.99 per month for up to 5,000 signatures with one certificate profile, or $99.99 per month for up to 100,000 signatures with 10 certificate profiles.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nMicrosoft said this week the service is [now generally available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-blog/simplifying-code-signing-for-windows-apps-artifact-signing-ga/4482789) – but only for organizations or individuals in the USA and Canada, or for organizations in the EU or UK. For organizations, certificates must use the “legal entity’s validated name”, such as that listed at the UK’s Companies House. There is a hint that “new region availability” is on the way as the service evolves.\n\nApplications can be signed via AAS using a number of different tools, including the signtool command-line utility that is part of the Windows SDK (software development kit). Specifically supported workflows include GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps tasks, PowerShell, and a dedicated Artifact Signing SDK.\n\n![The Azure Artifact Signing service has both Basic and Premium plans](https://image.devclass.com/4079560.webp?imageId=4079560&width=960&height=1324&format=jpg)\n\nThe Azure Artifact Signing service has both Basic and Premium plans\n\nThese certificates are not Extended Validation (EV) and the [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/artifact-signing/faq) states that “there is no plan to issue EV certificates.” EV certificates from third parties are priced at a premium and intended to convey greater reassurance, via more extensive identity checks.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe certificates issued by AAS will work on versions of Windows back to Windows 7.0 SP1, [provided](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5022661-windows-support-for-the-trusted-signing-formerly-azure-code-signing-program-4b505a31-fa1e-4ea6-85dd-6630229e8ef4) that a required Microsoft root certificate authority is installed. This should be automatic for computers with internet access.\n\nTraditionally, Windows applications were signed via a code-signing certificate obtained from a third-party. The certificate provider verified the identity of the developer, who would then download the certificate and use it to sign applications, typically with signtool. It is near-essential for deployment. Although it is possible to run an unsigned application on Windows, doing so means approving warnings regarding the risks of executables from unknown publishers. In an enterprise environment, admins can [configure policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/applocker/working-with-applocker-policies) to prevent unsigned applications from running.\n\nThe old approach, where long-lived certificates were installed on a developer PC, was vulnerable to theft and misuse, and the industry has tightened the requirements. The [latest](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/code-signing/requirements/) can be found at the Certificate Authority Browser Forum (CABF) and include storage of the certificate in a Hardware Crypto Module (HCM), for example a secure USB device, in place since June 1 2023. Newer requirements include not supporting the SHA-1 algorithm, and from March 1 2026, a maximum validity of 460 days. This has increased the cost of third-party certificates, especially when a USB device is included. Signing with USB devices is also impractical for cloud-based workflows. AAS exceeds the validity requirement, with a lifetime of just one day.\n\nManaging code signing certificates is a burden for developers. AAS is relatively inexpensive; the documentation for Electron, a popular cross-platform framework, [states](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/code-signing/code-signing-windows) that it is “the cheapest option for code signing on Windows.” Code signing for a Mac requires a separate certificate and process managed by Apple, at further cost.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nAAS looks like a welcome new service, though along with the regional limitations there are plenty of things that can go wrong. The FAQ is worth reading carefully. Among other things, it notes how critical it is to have the correct documents and to respond to validation emails.\n\n[security](/tag/security)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2026%2F01%2F14%2Fcode-signing-windows-apps-may-be-easier-and-more-secure-with-new-azure-artifact-service%2F4079554 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2026%2F01%2F14%2Fcode-signing-windows-apps-may-be-easier-and-more-secure-with-new-azure-artifact-service%2F4079554 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2026%2F01%2F14%2Fcode-signing-windows-apps-may-be-easier-and-more-secure-with-new-azure-artifact-service%2F4079554 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Code%20signing%20Windows%20apps%20may%20be%20easier%20and%20more%20secure%20with%20new%20Azure%20Artifact%20service%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2026%2F01%2F14%2Fcode-signing-windows-apps-may-be-easier-and-more-secure-with-new-azure-artifact-service%2F4079554 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2026%2F01%2F14%2Fcode-signing-windows-apps-may-be-easier-and-more-secure-with-new-azure-artifact-service%2F4079554&title=Code%20signing%20Windows%20apps%20may%20be%20easier%20and%20more%20secure%20with%20new%20Azure%20Artifact%20service https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Code%20signing%20Windows%20apps%20may%20be%20easier%20and%20more%20secure%20with%20new%20Azure%20Artifact%20service%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2026%2F01%2F14%2Fcode-signing-windows-apps-may-be-easier-and-more-secure-with-new-azure-artifact-service%2F4079554\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
