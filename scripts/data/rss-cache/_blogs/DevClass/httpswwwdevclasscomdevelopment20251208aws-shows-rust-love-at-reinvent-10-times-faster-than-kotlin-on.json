Mesaros kicked off with the story of Aurora DSQL, a distributed and mostly PostgreSQL compatible database, which was rewritten from Kotlin to Go to solve performance issues. That journey was [described](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html) earlier this year by AWS CTO Werner Vogels. “The [Rust] code was 10x faster than our carefully tuned Kotlin implementation – despite no attempt to make it faster,” said Vogels.\n\nMesaros said Rust is now the default for all data plane projects at AWS. The cloud giant also uses Rust for its micro vms (virtual machines) Bottlerocket and Firecracker.\n\nDevelopers might not be surprised that Rust is so much more performant than Kotlin but the comparison with Go is less obvious since Go also compiles to native code. Stuyvenberg spoke in detail about Datadog’s experience with its observability agent, written in Go, when ported to run as an extension on AWS Lambda in order to monitor Lambda functions.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nUsing Go for this on Lambda “got us out of the door quickly but had some problems,” said Stuyvenberg. In particular, the cold start time or initialization duration was between 700 and 800 milliseconds, which was “an incredible overhead for people to stomach when they are moving to serverless and they want observability … it was untenable.”\n\nMigrating this to Rust reduced this overhead to 80 milliseconds, said Stuyvenberg.\n\n![](https://image.devclass.com/1683595.webp?imageId=1683595&width=960&height=542&format=jpg)\n\nA slide shown at re:Invent shows that a Rust implementation can handle many times more points per second (PPS) than the equivalent written in Go\n\nDatadog is now in the process of migrating more of its agent code to Rust, even when not running on Lambda. The issue with Go, said Stuyvenberg, is that observability code tends to require many small memory allocations in order to collect and save millions of data points. The Go code “spends 30 percent of its time in garbage collection” he said. The overall result was that the Rust code was almost three times faster, and could handle many times as many data points per second than the Go equivalent.\n\nIt is possible to optimize Go code by reducing use of the garbage collector, using a technique called off-heap memory management. The problem with this, said Stuyvenberg, is that this code becomes an “unmaintainable mess” because it is not the way Go was designed. Therefore, “idiomatic Rust code yields the performance of what carefully optimized Go code does,” he said.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nTips for using Rust? The two speakers recommended setting clippy warnings – [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) being a Rust linter – so that that builds with warnings fail. They also recommended not using the unwrap() and expect() error handling functions other than for debugging, and to remove them in production code. When using Rust with Lambda, they suggested use of the Lambda emulator for debugging, which is especially useful for code using the tokio networking library as the emulator gives access to the tokio console, a debugging and profiling tool, but Lambda itself does not.\n\nSupport for Rust functions in Lambda was [made generally available](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/aws-lambda-rust/) last month, though it has been working well for some time. There is no Lambda runtime for Rust; because it is native code, it is an OS-only runtime, typically using Amazon Linux 2023.\n\nThe full presentation is at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buBBQ5mXAi8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buBBQ5mXAi8).\n\n[development](/tag/development) [vms](/tag/vms)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F08%2Faws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go%2F1728671 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F08%2Faws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go%2F1728671 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F08%2Faws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go%2F1728671 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=AWS%20shows%20Rust%20love%20at%20re%3AInvent%3A%2010%20times%20faster%20than%20Kotlin%2C%20one%20tenth%20the%20latency%20of%20Go%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F08%2Faws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go%2F1728671 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F08%2Faws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go%2F1728671&title=AWS%20shows%20Rust%20love%20at%20re%3AInvent%3A%2010%20times%20faster%20than%20Kotlin%2C%20one%20tenth%20the%20latency%20of%20Go https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=AWS%20shows%20Rust%20love%20at%20re%3AInvent%3A%2010%20times%20faster%20than%20Kotlin%2C%20one%20tenth%20the%20latency%20of%20Go%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F08%2Faws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go%2F1728671\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
