Only an engineer familiar with synchronization code has the confidence to \"point out the agent’s mistakes,\" the paper states.\n\nThe snag is that the natural action of organizations observing this productivity issue is to hire fewer EiC developers. [A paper from Harvard University](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5425555), referenced by Russinovich and Hanselman, studied the impact of generative AI adoption on job postings, and concluded that \"junior employment declines sharply in adopting firms relative to non-adopters, while senior employment remains largely unchanged.\"\n\nThe logical outcome is that “if organizations focus only on short-term efficiency – hiring those who can already direct AI – they risk hollowing out the next generation of technical leaders,\" state Russinovich and Hanselman in their paper.\n\nThe two execs argue that large companies must continue hiring EiC developers, accepting that they initially reduce productivity, and make guiding and training them an explicit goal. In a \"preceptor-based organization” senior engineers pair with EiC developers to direct AI coding agents.\n\nAnother suggestion is that coding assistants could have an \"EiC mode\" in which coaching is undertaken by the agent – though bearing in mind the kinds of agentic mistakes Russinovich and Hanselman identify, this might not always work as intended.\n\nIn their podcast, the two executives also state that universities do not have the right model for teaching computer science to undergraduates. \"You need [some] classes where using AI is considered cheating,\" said Russinovich.\n\nThere is a question about whether Microsoft itself is listening. In May last year, the company revealed [plans to reduce staff](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/16/microsofts_axe_software_developers/) with software engineering suffering the largest cuts. Nevertheless, in their podcast Russinovich said that \"we’re starting a pilot on this at Microsoft”. Hanselman was asked on LinkedIn if senior engineers will now be assessed on their human as well as their product impact, to which he replied “that is our goal.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe notion that part of the role of senior staff is to teach juniors is nothing new; but what worries Russinovich and Hanselman is what they see as a dangerous trend, where increased AI adoption is causing fewer EiC hires and storing up future trouble.\n\nThat said, this is an uncertain area. AI coding agents are likely to improve, and according to a recent [workshop on AI development](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/21/should-there-be-a-new-manifesto-for-ai-development/4091612) hosted by Thoughtworks junior developers have some advantages when using AI thanks to fewer preconceptions about how coding should be done.\n\nThe ACM paper is presented as opinion from Russinovich and Hanselman, not as official Microsoft research. \"While AI is boosting software development, examples of frontier coding agents exhibiting intern-like behaviors demonstrate their limitations,\" the duo state, reflecting a more nuanced view than that given by the relentless promotion of AI from their company.\n\n[development](/tag/development) [tech jobs](/tag/tech%20jobs) [ai](/tag/ai)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Ftop-microsoft-execs-fret-about-impact-of-ai-on-software-engineering-profession%2F4091789 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Ftop-microsoft-execs-fret-about-impact-of-ai-on-software-engineering-profession%2F4091789 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Ftop-microsoft-execs-fret-about-impact-of-ai-on-software-engineering-profession%2F4091789 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Top%20Microsoft%20execs%20fret%20about%20impact%20of%20AI%20on%20software%20engineering%20profession%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Ftop-microsoft-execs-fret-about-impact-of-ai-on-software-engineering-profession%2F4091789 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Ftop-microsoft-execs-fret-about-impact-of-ai-on-software-engineering-profession%2F4091789&title=Top%20Microsoft%20execs%20fret%20about%20impact%20of%20AI%20on%20software%20engineering%20profession https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Top%20Microsoft%20execs%20fret%20about%20impact%20of%20AI%20on%20software%20engineering%20profession%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F26%2Ftop-microsoft-execs-fret-about-impact-of-ai-on-software-engineering-profession%2F4091789\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/105568.jpg?imageId=105568&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Top Microsoft execs fret about impact of AI on software engineering profession\nMicrosoft's Mark Russinovich and Scott Hanselman say that companies must hire junior devs and teach them to fix the mistakes made by AI -
