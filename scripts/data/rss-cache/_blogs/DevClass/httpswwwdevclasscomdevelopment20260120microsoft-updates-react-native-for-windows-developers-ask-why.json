This is in contrast to MAUI (Multi-platform App UI), a .NET cross-platform framework which is promoted to developers but appears to have little internal adoption.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[Hermes](https://github.com/facebook/Hermes) is the default JavaScript engine for React Native and is optimized for fast start-up using ahead-of-time optimization. The new release enables use of React Native DevTools (based on Chrome DevTools) to debug JavaScript in React Native, including breakpoints, variable inspection, profiling, memory snapshots, and component inspection. [According](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/%F0%9F%9A%80react-native-windows-v0-81-is-here/) to the team, “Windows developers now get the same debugging experience as Android and iOS.”\n\nThis appears to be not quite the case though, since the network and performance tabs in the DevTools are not yet enabled, but will be when the Windows release reaches 0.83.\n\n![The React Native Gallery is in the Windows Store, with code available on GitHub, demonstrating a range of components and resources](https://image.devclass.com/4079630.webp?imageId=4079630&width=960&height=658&format=jpg)\n\nThe React Native Gallery is in the Windows Store, with code available on GitHub, demonstrating a range of components and resources\n\nThe new release does include component enhancements including better text handling and improved accessibility.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nReact Native was developed by Meta to enable cross-platform user interfaces using JavaScript, not using a web view, but rendering native widgets. The same React framework code runs in the app as used in web applications, but rendering to native platform views. The result is that developers can share JavaScript code between web and mobile applications without relying on an embedded web browser or giving up a native look and feel.\n\nThe framework is used by Meta for mobile apps including Facebook and Instagram, and by others including Amazon and Shopify.\n\nIn 2018, the React Native team began work on a new architecture, including a rendering system called Fabric which performs better than the old bridge between JavaScript and native components. The Windows implementation has also migrated to the new architecture, and this 0.81 release is the last to support the old architecture.\n\nAn important feature of React Native is its support for native code modules. In the old architecture, developers could use either C++ or C# modules in Windows apps. The new architecture though does not support C#, only C++. “Most React Native for Windows applications and libraries, not to mention React Native for Windows itself, are written in C++ so the team prioritized C++ support first,” say the [docs](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/next/new-architecture).\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThere are plans to support C# in future but “what exists is not nearly robust enough to support the React Native ecosystem,” according to the team.\n\nThis is one of several caveats regarding development using React Native for Windows. Another is that third-party support is limited, compared to the more widely used iOS and Android versions. The React Native [packages registry](https://reactnative.directory) shows more than 2,000 packages available for mobile, but only 67 for Windows.\n\nDespite those caveats, and the lag in implementing new versions, the future of React Native for Windows is underpinned by Microsoft’s own usage by the Office team. The company [said](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/2025-05-09-office-modernize/) last year that React Native is “critical for Office’s modernization efforts” and that “React Native content islands seamlessly integrate into an app’s overall UI giving a consistent look and feel across an application.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe popularity of JavaScript/TypeScript means that React Native for Windows may be worth a look for developers who need desktop applications as well as mobile.\n\nThere is a question though: why does Microsoft support two cross-platform frameworks which have a lot in common, since both use high-level languages (JavaScript or C#) and both render native platform widgets? “Why didn’t the Office team use Maui for cross platform?” [asked](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/react-native/2025-05-09-office-modernize/?commentid=6#comment-6) one developer, with no answer yet.\n\nThe reason may be partly technical, but may also go back to long-standing internal differences between the developer division, and the Windows and Office teams.\n\n[development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F20%2Fmicrosoft-updates-react-native-for-windows-developers-ask-why-not-use-maui%2F4079595 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F20%2Fmicrosoft-updates-react-native-for-windows-developers-ask-why-not-use-maui%2F4079595 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F20%2Fmicrosoft-updates-react-native-for-windows-developers-ask-why-not-use-maui%2F4079595 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Microsoft%20updates%20React%20Native%20for%20Windows.%20Developers%20ask%2C%20 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F20%2Fmicrosoft-updates-react-native-for-windows-developers-ask-why-not-use-maui%2F4079595&title=Microsoft%20updates%20React%20Native%20for%20Windows.%20Developers%20ask%2C%20 https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Microsoft%20updates%20React%20Native%20for%20Windows.%20Developers%20ask%2C%20\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
