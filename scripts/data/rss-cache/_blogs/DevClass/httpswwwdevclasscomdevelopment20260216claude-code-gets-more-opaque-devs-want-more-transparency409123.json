Does not show full thinking, hook output, or subagent output (coming in tomorrow’s release).\"\n\nThe problem with this is that making verbose mode less verbose is a bad change for those who wanted the full details.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nCherny also participated in a lengthy [discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46978710) on Hacker News. \"Claude has gotten more intelligent, it runs for longer periods of time, and it is able to more agentically use more tools … the amount of output this generates can quickly become overwhelming in a terminal, and is something we hear often from users,\" he said.\n\nThose users who want the collapsed output seem to be mostly absent from the discussion. \"I can’t tell you how many times I benefitted from seeing the files Claude was reading, to understand how I could interrupt and give it a little more context… saving thousands of tokens\" [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46982115) one response.\n\nCherny said that the repurposed verbose mode was the solution, and that Claude Code will still default to the condensed view.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe debate is important, because if AI tools like Claude Code hide what they are doing from developers (or other users) then it is more likely that mistakes will go unnoticed. \"I'm a Claude user who has been burned lately by how opaque the system has become,\" [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46988932) another developer. \"Right now Claude cannot be trusted to get things right without constant oversight and frequent correction, often for just a single step. For people like me, this is make or break. If I cannot follow the reasoning, read the intent, or catch logic disconnects early, the session just burns through my token quota.\"\n\nClaude Code changes frequently so it is likely that this aspect will be further tweaked, but there is not yet any indication that it will revert to the old behavior.\n\n[anthropic](/tag/anthropic) [development](/tag/development) [claude](/tag/claude) [ai](/tag/ai)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F16%2Fclaude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency%2F4091233 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F16%2Fclaude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency%2F4091233 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F16%2Fclaude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency%2F4091233 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Claude%20code%20gets%20more%20opaque%2C%20devs%20want%20more%20transparency%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F16%2Fclaude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency%2F4091233 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F16%2Fclaude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency%2F4091233&title=Claude%20code%20gets%20more%20opaque%2C%20devs%20want%20more%20transparency https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Claude%20code%20gets%20more%20opaque%2C%20devs%20want%20more%20transparency%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F16%2Fclaude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency%2F4091233\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
