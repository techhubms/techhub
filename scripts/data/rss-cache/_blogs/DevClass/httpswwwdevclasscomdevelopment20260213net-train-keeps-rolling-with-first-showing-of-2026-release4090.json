Although nearly invisible to developers, the Mono runtime is still used for mobile apps built with MAUI (Multi-platform app user interface) and for WebAssembly. Although the Mono project was handed over to WineHQ. Microsoft still maintains a [mono runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/mono) as part of the .NET code.\n\nIn .NET 11, CoreCLR becomes a target in the .NET WebAssembly SDK, used by some varieties of Blazor. CoreCLR also becomes the default for Android builds, whereas in .NET 10 this is an experimental feature. CoreCLR is the main .NET runtime and this represents another step towards removing Mono dependencies from .NET.\n\nIn the .NET 11 libraries, the update includes Zstandard compression support, with improved performance.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe C# language is updated with each new release of .NET, and .NET 11 will also bring C# 15. There will be plenty more changes to come, but in this preview developers can try out collection expression arguments, which enable customization of a collection object when it is created. In order to retain backward compatibility, the arguments which modify the collection, such as setting its capacity or a custom comparer, are included in a dummy element. An example is:\n\nList names = [with(capacity: values.Count \\* 2), .. values];\n\nThe [language proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/collection-expression-arguments.md) explains that while technically a breaking change, this will only break existing code if there was a call to a pre-existing method called with. Even in that unlikely case, it could be fixed by using @with.\n\nThe approach is still, perhaps, inelegant; and the feature has provoked a [lengthy debate](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/8886) in the C# repository. Two weeks ago Microsoft software developer Cyrus Najmabadi [closed down the discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/8886#discussioncomment-15658139) stating that the LDM (language design meeting) had come up with \"an implementation that addresses the core motivations well.\"\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThat did not stop a developer from [commenting](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-11-preview-1/?commentid=22730#comment-22730) on the preview that \"the syntax looks out of place in C#\" and questioning whether it is \"getting the language one step closer to all the C++ gotchas, with special cased syntax.\"\n\nFortunately C# remains nowhere close to the complexity of C++; but every improvement comes with a cost.\n\nFind more details on the preview [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-11-preview-1/).\n\n[microsoft](/tag/microsoft) [.net](/tag/.net) [development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F13%2Fnet-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release%2F4090277 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F13%2Fnet-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release%2F4090277 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F13%2Fnet-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release%2F4090277 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=.NET%20train%20keeps%20rolling%20with%20first%20showing%20of%202026%20release%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F13%2Fnet-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release%2F4090277 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F13%2Fnet-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release%2F4090277&title=.NET%20train%20keeps%20rolling%20with%20first%20showing%20of%202026%20release https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=.NET%20train%20keeps%20rolling%20with%20first%20showing%20of%202026%20release%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F13%2Fnet-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release%2F4090277\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
