The tool evolved from an earlier experiment called XamlPad.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nXAML Studio is not quite a visual designer but is lightweight and responsive, with IntelliSense and live preview, as well as handy links to documentation on WinUI elements. The idea is that developers design a user interface (UI) in XAML Studio and then use copy and paste to get the designs into Visual Studio.\n\nDevelopers may have presumed that XAML Studio was abandoned. Version 1.1 was released in late 2019 and is still the current offering in the Microsoft Store. [According](https://github.com/dotnet/XAMLStudio/discussions/26) to Hawker though, he has been attempting to open source it since 2020, and has only now achieved it with help from the .NET Foundation, which he says has adopted it as a “seed project”.\n\n![XAML Studio 2 pre-beta running in debug mode in Visual Studio 2026](https://image.devclass.com/4079622.webp?imageId=4079622&width=960&height=676&format=jpg)\n\nXAML Studio 2 pre-beta running in debug mode in Visual Studio 2026\n\nWork on XAML Studio 2.0 is in progress, with an updated design based on Microsoft’s Fluent UI design language, and support for WinUI 3 components. We were able to get the latest pre-beta code for 2.0 to run in Visual Studio 2026 on an Arm 64 version of Windows, though only the x86 build and only when debugging in Visual Studio. It is worth using the latest code despite issues, since version 1.1 is out of date. The [roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/XAMLStudio/issues/34) includes “building for (Modern) UWP and WinUI 3 together as part of single SDK-style modern project.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nWe observe though that XAML Studio currently looks like a one-person project; perhaps not surprising since it has only just emerged into open source, but Hawker will need to build a community around it for any chance of future significance.\n\nThose not familiar with the intricacies of Microsoft’s XAML-based UI frameworks must note that UWP (universal windows platform) components are different from WinUI 3 components, that WinUI 3 is very different from WinUI 2, and these are different again from the cross-platform MAUI flavor of XAML.\n\nThe early success of Windows was in part built on the ease of creating Visual Basic applications using drag-and-drop tools. Today the primary framework for Windows desktop applications is supposedly WinUI 3, but this has no visual designer.\n\nA note in the documentation [states](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/xaml-tools/creating-a-ui-by-using-xaml-designer-in-visual-studio?view=visualstudio) that “WinUI 3 / .NET MAUI XAML designer is not supported in Visual Studio … use XAML Hot Reload.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nA feature request for a visual designer for WinUI 3 is one of the [top feedback issues](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Feature-request-Visual-designer-for-Wi/1608476) and still technically “under review”, but looks unlikely to be met. An [update](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Updates-to-Live-Preview-Hot-Reload-and/10846679) in February last year extended Live Preview and Hot Reload to design time, potentially making XAML Studio less necessary but still not satisfying those looking for a true visual designer.\n\nAs for the cross-platform .NET MAUI, Microsoft [reported](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/XAML-Designer-for-Net-MAUI/10224319) in September that “a drag-and-drop UI designer is not part of our direction for .NET MAUI.”\n\nDevelopers wishing for the native look and feel of Windows 11 will want to use WinUI 3, but considering the above problems, many who want only to be as productive as possible in creating line of business applications for Windows are more likely to use the ancient (but somewhat revived) Windows Forms or Windows Presentation Foundation frameworks instead.\n\n[development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F07%2Fmicrosoft-open-sources-xaml-studio-amid-developer-discontent-with-visual-studio-designers%2F4079573 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F07%2Fmicrosoft-open-sources-xaml-studio-amid-developer-discontent-with-visual-studio-designers%2F4079573 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F07%2Fmicrosoft-open-sources-xaml-studio-amid-developer-discontent-with-visual-studio-designers%2F4079573 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Microsoft%20open%20sources%20XAML%20Studio%20amid%20developer%20discontent%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20designers%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F07%2Fmicrosoft-open-sources-xaml-studio-amid-developer-discontent-with-visual-studio-designers%2F4079573 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F07%2Fmicrosoft-open-sources-xaml-studio-amid-developer-discontent-with-visual-studio-designers%2F4079573&title=Microsoft%20open%20sources%20XAML%20Studio%20amid%20developer%20discontent%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20designers https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Microsoft%20open%20sources%20XAML%20Studio%20amid%20developer%20discontent%20with%20Visual%20Studio%20designers%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F07%2Fmicrosoft-open-sources-xaml-studio-amid-developer-discontent-with-visual-studio-designers%2F4079573\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
