Further variants include a side-bar in ChatGPT, and IDE extensions for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Cursor, Windsurf and JetBrains IDEs.\n\nThe Codex app enables developers to create and manage multiple projects, each with one or more agents running in separate threads. Features include scheduled automations, the ability for agents to run locally or remotely, support for Git worktrees so agent-generated code is separate from the main branch, agent skills for giving Codex specialist instructions, a built-in terminal, and sandboxing to control which directories and network access Codex can use.\n\nIntegration with the CLI and IDE extensions means that the Codex app shares settings regarding which MCP (model context protocol) servers it can use and their configuration. It is easy to switch away from the Codex app to work in an IDE when needed.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe Codex app looks like OpenAI’s answer to Anthropic’s [Claude desktop app](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/desktop), currently in preview. Early experiences with the Codex app vary but the concept is welcome. OpenAI has made Codex App work with even the free tier for ChatGPT, for an initial period.\n\nA common refrain in the first feedback is that the Codex app is not yet available for Windows or Linux, though both are promised. \"Mac only. Again. Apple is great but this is OpenAI devs showing their disconnect from the mainstream,\" [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46859620) one developer. A member of the OpenAI team replied that \"the team actually built the app in Electron specifically so we can support Windows and Linux as well.\" The hitch, according to another comment, is that \"it's taking us some time to get really solid sandboxing working on Windows, where there are fewer OS-level primitives for it.\"\n\nThe issue is linked to the experimental Windows sandbox [described here](https://developers.openai.com/codex/windows), and which has limitations. \"When using the Windows sandbox, Codex scans for folders where Everyone has write access and recommends that you remove that access,\" the docs state, showing the complexity of this approach.\n\nSome Mac developers are also unhappy, because OpenAI is using Electron rather than a native code application. Electron is a cross-platform framework based on embedding the Chromium web browser and Node.js runtime, and while it is effective for cross-platform support, it uses more memory than native code. The popularity of Electron, which is also used by other developer tools including VS Code, Docker Desktop and Slack, means that multiple instances can run at once, adding to the resource burden.\n\n[development](/tag/development) [openai](/tag/openai)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F05%2Ftraditional-ides-not-the-right-tool-for-development-with-agentic-ai-openai-claims%2F4090132 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F05%2Ftraditional-ides-not-the-right-tool-for-development-with-agentic-ai-openai-claims%2F4090132 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F05%2Ftraditional-ides-not-the-right-tool-for-development-with-agentic-ai-openai-claims%2F4090132 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Traditional%20IDEs%20not%20the%20right%20tool%20for%20development%20with%20agentic%20AI%2C%20OpenAI%20claims%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F05%2Ftraditional-ides-not-the-right-tool-for-development-with-agentic-ai-openai-claims%2F4090132 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F05%2Ftraditional-ides-not-the-right-tool-for-development-with-agentic-ai-openai-claims%2F4090132&title=Traditional%20IDEs%20not%20the%20right%20tool%20for%20development%20with%20agentic%20AI%2C%20OpenAI%20claims https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Traditional%20IDEs%20not%20the%20right%20tool%20for%20development%20with%20agentic%20AI%2C%20OpenAI%20claims%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F05%2Ftraditional-ides-not-the-right-tool-for-development-with-agentic-ai-openai-claims%2F4090132\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
