The move comes as competitors offer faster, cheaper alternatives.\n\nWhile GitHub-hosted runner prices will drop [20 and 39 percent from January 1 2026](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/), the new self-hosted fees have drawn sharp criticism. Developers object to paying per-minute charges for software running on their own infrastructure.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nGitHub [justifies the change](https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/) by noting that GitHub-hosted revenue was subsidizing free self-hosted runners, despite costs for “maintaining and evolving GitHub Actions” (which now runs 71 million jobs daily).\n\nThe price changes do not affect users of GitHub Enterprise Server, which runs on-premises, and GitHub Actions remain free for public repositories. The company claims that “96 percent of customers will see no change to their bill”, and that most customers who are impacted will pay less.\n\nDevelopers in discussions, such as [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1po996g/starting_march_1_2026_github_will_introduce_a_new/) on Reddit, complain about “the audacity to charge for self-hosted compute.” Paying to run licensed software is hardly new, however, the change is unpalatable for some.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nGitHub’s move may be in response to competitors such as Depot, which offers optimized runners for GitHub actions, with per-second billing, at what [it claims](https://depot.dev) is “half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners.”\n\nOne user [branded](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46291975) the change as “absolutely bananas”, saying: “for my own CI workflow I’ll have to pay $140+/month now just to run my own hardware” – though this reflects unusually intensive usage.\n\nWhy is developer reaction negative overall? Despite there being a cost reduction for many users, GitHub is perceived as neglecting its core platform. A developer observed that the open source runner application, used to set up a self-hosted machine, is not taking contributions, the [stated reason](https://github.com/actions/runner?tab=readme-ov-file#note) being that “we are allocating resources towards other areas of Actions.” One customer [complained](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46294001) that GitHub runners are hard to host, with an “unnecessarily byzantine” configuration process, and there are faults with the service including inability to cancel jobs cleanly and consistency problems.\n\nSelf-hosted runners are popular in part because of performance issues with the GitHub-hosted option. “We self host the runners in our infrastructure and the builds are over 10x faster than relying on their cloud runners,” [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46292716) one user.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nGitHub said that along with the price changes it will invest in self-hosted Actions, with a new scale-set client, [multi-label support](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1195) for Actions Runner Controller for more flexibility in managing runners, and a new Actions Data Stream which will provide real-time observability data for GitHub workflows.\n\nWhile this may help, the company has a lot to do in order to persuade developers that it is focused on core platform improvements, rather than just controversial AI features and user interface changes. The Zig project recently moved away from GitHub [citing](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/zig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly/) unreliable and neglected Actions as one of the reasons.\n\n[devops](/tag/devops) [development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F17%2Fgithub-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026%2F1734518 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F17%2Fgithub-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026%2F1734518 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F17%2Fgithub-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026%2F1734518 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=GitHub%20to%20charge%20for%20self-hosted%20runners%20from%20March%202026%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F17%2Fgithub-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026%2F1734518 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F17%2Fgithub-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026%2F1734518&title=GitHub%20to%20charge%20for%20self-hosted%20runners%20from%20March%202026 https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=GitHub%20to%20charge%20for%20self-hosted%20runners%20from%20March%202026%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F17%2Fgithub-to-charge-for-self-hosted-runners-from-march-2026%2F1734518\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
