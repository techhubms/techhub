At a session titled “To InGate and beyond Ingress-nginx” maintainers James Strong and Marco Ebert announced the cessation of development effort on both Ingress NGINX and InGate, which was originally intended to be its successor. The first slide at the presentation stated, “Not the title you expected.”\n\nThe core problem, the maintainers said, was unreasonable pressure on them as volunteers and the lack of others stepping up to help. The InGate project never really got started, they said, with just one developer. “People weren’t as excited about InGate and Gateway API as we thought they would be,” they reported.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nConsidering the severity of the warning, it was surprising to discover from a [discussion on the matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LwHeScfW-8) that Kubernetes leadership pushed for development to cease earlier rather than later. “When we talked about the deprecation date, there were some folks who wanted us to do it that week in Atlanta,” said Strong. “We pushed for about a year or so, we were able to reconcile and get the four months.” The last release is now planned to coincide with KubeCon Europe in Amsterdam, 23-26 March.\n\nAs so often with Kubernetes, it is a complex situation. Kubernetes is an API, for which there are many implementations. The [Ingress API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) routes network traffic to different backend services based on user configuration. This API is frozen and the project recommends using its successor, the Gateway API, instead, though the Ingress API is stable and will remain. “Gateway API is a much more complete API in the sense of features,” said RedHat’s Ricardo Katz, who is one of its maintainers (and a former Ingress NGINX maintainer). That said, many of the features of Ingress NGINX come in the form of annotations which add things that are not in the Ingress API specification.\n\n“If you are speaking just about the Ingress NGINX without any annotations, Gateway API can do everything,” said Katz, but because of the annotations, “there are a lot of things that Ingress NGINX can do that Gateway API cannot do yet, and some Gateway API will never do.”\n\nThe annotation issue means that even migration to another Ingress API implementation is not straightforward. For example, even [F5 NGINX Ingress](https://blog.nginx.org/blog/the-ingress-nginx-alternative-open-source-nginx-ingress-controller-for-the-long-term), an alternative which also uses the NGINX engine, has different annotations and a migration guide.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nIngress NGINX was one of the earliest implementations of an ingress controller for Kubernetes and was referenced in documentation, such that it seemed the safe and default choice for a deployment, and built on the popularity of the NGINX web server. With hindsight though, the project “exposed too much of the NGINX config … the big downfall for us was allowing people to inject Lua scripts … any time you allow an end user to run arbitrary code, you’re going to have security issues, and we did,” said Strong.\n\nPressure on the small maintainer team increased with the discovery of Ingres Nightmare, a remote code execution vulnerability caused by the ability to inject “an arbitrary NGINX configuration remotely,” as [reported](https://www.wiz.io/blog/ingress-nginx-kubernetes-vulnerabilities) by Wiz security in March 2025.\n\n“Not having more maintainers ended up burning me out and burning James out, and that’s something we need to speak out on open source,” said Katz.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nFollowing KubeCon Atlanta, there have been offers of help, but a [post](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/14178#issuecomment-3779849797) from Kubernetes steering committee member Benjamin Elder said that “even if the maintainers of this project agreed to hand it over to someone new, the Kubernetes project has decided jointly between the sponsoring SIG [special interest group], Ingress-Nginx Maintainers, the Security Response Committee, and the Steering Committee, that we must wind down this project.”\n\nBuilding trust to maintain critical software takes time, Elder said, and the offers needed to happen years ago, not at the last minute. “Nobody wanted this outcome and we are all just trying to mitigate the situation, generally in our spare time.”\n\nAsked what users facing migration challenges should do, Strong said, “contribute, get involved. If you have a need for a feature, go to the Gateway API meetings and speak up.”\n\nOptions for other controllers include Envoy Gateway (which integrates with Envoy Proxy), Traefik and Cilium. There are also forks of Ingres NGINX to which users can switch at their own risk, and SuSe is [offering](https://www.suse.com/c/trade-the-ingress-nginx-retirement-for-up-to-2-years-of-rke2-support-stability/) two years of support for paying customers.\n\n[security](/tag/security) [development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F29%2Fkubernetes-leadership-warns-of-ingress-nginx-risks-but-has-also-hastened-its-deprecation%2F4079569 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F29%2Fkubernetes-leadership-warns-of-ingress-nginx-risks-but-has-also-hastened-its-deprecation%2F4079569 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F29%2Fkubernetes-leadership-warns-of-ingress-nginx-risks-but-has-also-hastened-its-deprecation%2F4079569 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Kubernetes%20leadership%20warns%20of%20Ingress%20NGINX%20risks%2C%20but%20has%20also%20hastened%20its%20deprecation%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F29%2Fkubernetes-leadership-warns-of-ingress-nginx-risks-but-has-also-hastened-its-deprecation%2F4079569 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F29%2Fkubernetes-leadership-warns-of-ingress-nginx-risks-but-has-also-hastened-its-deprecation%2F4079569&title=Kubernetes%20leadership%20warns%20of%20Ingress%20NGINX%20risks%2C%20but%20has%20also%20hastened%20its%20deprecation https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Kubernetes%20leadership%20warns%20of%20Ingress%20NGINX%20risks%2C%20but%20has%20also%20hastened%20its%20deprecation%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F01%2F29%2Fkubernetes-leadership-warns-of-ingress-nginx-risks-but-has-also-hastened-its-deprecation%2F4079569\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
