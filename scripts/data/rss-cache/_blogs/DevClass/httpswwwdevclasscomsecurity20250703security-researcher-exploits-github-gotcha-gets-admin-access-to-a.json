Istio is open source service mesh software that is widely used with Kubernetes, and if compromised could impact thousands of enterprises. The token has now been revoked.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe problem is what happens when a developer accidentally commits code that includes secrets, realizes their mistake, and attempts to remove the commit. Git repositories are designed to preserve code history, so to remove a commit is working against this; even though there are circumstances in which it is essential. A developer, for example, might hard-code a password for a quick test, or forget to exclude a file or directory containing secrets from the repository, and then make the commit before discovering the error.\n\nIn this case, how does one stop the erroneous commit from replicating to all developers fetching code from the repository? It is not a new problem; there is a question about it [from 2009](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448919/how-can-i-remove-a-commit-on-github) on StackOverflow. The quick answer is called a force push; developers can reset the commit history to before it happened and then use git force push to make the same change on the origin repository. This works to some extent, in that it rewrites the commit history and other developers who have not already fetched the erroneous commit will not now see it, but it is not a complete solution. The bad commit remains in the GitHub cache, and can be retrieved via its hash.\n\nAll this has been well-known for years. “The commit can still be accessible directly via SHA1. Force push does not delete the commit, it creates a new one and moves the file pointer to it. To truly delete a commit you must delete the whole repo,” [said a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448919/how-can-i-remove-a-commit-on-github#comment21828959_448919) back in 2013.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nGitHub has a [support article](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository) on the topic which includes using a utility called git-filter-repo before making a force push, but also adds that GitHub support must be contacted to remove all traces of the compromised data. Support will deference or delete any affected pull requests, run garbage collection on the server, remove cached views, and purge orphaned LFS (Large File Storage) objects.\n\nThat is a lot of work to undo an error that took only a moment, making it unsurprising that developers on occasion look for a quicker solution or are perhaps unwilling to confess an embarrassing mistake.\n\nThe problem is made worse by the existence of [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org), a project which records all activity on public repositories and stores it in a public dataset on Google BigQuery. This is handy for research, but also ideal for security researchers (or worse) looking for orphaned commits, which is how these deleted commits end up, if not properly processed. Brizinov used this along with a quickly coded application to grab these commits and look for secrets. “The most interesting leaked secrets were GitHub PAT tokens and AWS credentials,” he said. A common error was including a .env (environment) file within a commit, accounting for just over half of the leaks.\n\nThis is not really a GitHub flaw, though developers would be helped if there were some way of actually deleting commits without having to raise a support request.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nAnother option when suffering this kind of incident is to remove the value of the leaked secrets by immediately revoking tokens and changing leaked passwords.\n\nTruffle Security offers a utility to find leaked secrets for specific organizations, but it may be too late.\n\nGitHub suggests in its support article that developers avoid making the bad commits, by observing best practice and by scanning for sensitive data using a pre-commit hook invoking something like [AWS git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets).\n\n[security](/tag/security)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fsecurity-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more%2F101129 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fsecurity-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more%2F101129 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fsecurity-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more%2F101129 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Security%20researcher%20exploits%20GitHub%20gotcha%2C%20gets%20admin%20access%20to%20all%20Istio%20repositories%20and%20more%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fsecurity-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more%2F101129 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fsecurity-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more%2F101129&title=Security%20researcher%20exploits%20GitHub%20gotcha%2C%20gets%20admin%20access%20to%20all%20Istio%20repositories%20and%20more https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Security%20researcher%20exploits%20GitHub%20gotcha%2C%20gets%20admin%20access%20to%20all%20Istio%20repositories%20and%20more%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fsecurity%2F2025%2F07%2F03%2Fsecurity-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more%2F101129\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
