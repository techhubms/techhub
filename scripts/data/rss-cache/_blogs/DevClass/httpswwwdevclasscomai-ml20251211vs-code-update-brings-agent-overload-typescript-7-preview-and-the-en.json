Oddly, although “VS Code now includes Agent HQ” is touted as the first new feature in the [release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_107), the term is not mentioned again. This [GitHub post](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/welcome-home-agents/) explains that Agent HQ is not a feature, but rather a direction towards integrating agents from multiple vendors into the coding workflow.\n\n![The Agent Sessions view in VS Code is part of the Agent HQ experience, though this view is now disabled by default. This example from the official video shows multiple background agents working concurrently, locally and in the cloud.](https://image.devclass.com/1683629.webp?imageId=1683629&width=960&height=512&format=jpg)\n\nThe Agent Sessions view in VS Code is part of the Agent HQ experience, though this view is now disabled by default. This example from the official video shows multiple background agents working concurrently, locally and in the cloud.\n\nEarlier this week, an [official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfnod4Sw0gY) presented Agent HQ in VS Code, but the feature shown is the preview of Agent Sessions view. Despite the presenter’s enthusiasm for this, the latest release disables this view by default, because agent sessions are now integrated into Chat. “If you prefer to keep using the standalone view, you can re-enable it via chat.agentSessionsViewLocation,” the release notes state, though adding: “in a future release, we plan to remove the standalone view entirely.”\n\nLeaving aside the Agent HQ confusion, there are 10 new agent features in the update, including keeping agents active while chat is closed, moving agent sessions from local to cloud, customizing background agents, running custom subagents, and sharing agents across an organization.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nAI agents can speed productivity but there are security concerns over issues such as prompt injection, where a malicious instruction reaches the agent, or AI mishaps arising from the inherent unreliability of generative AI – such as a recent case where Google’s Antigravity [wiped an entire hard drive partition](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/01/google_antigravity_wipes_d_drive/).\n\n![The YOLO setting in VS Code is disabled by default, but why does it exist if it is harmful?](https://image.devclass.com/1683627.webp?imageId=1683627&width=960&height=340&format=jpg)\n\nThe YOLO setting in VS Code is disabled by default, but why does it exist if it is harmful?\n\nWe noticed that VS Code has a specific YOLO (you only live once) option which disables manual approval completely for all tools in all workspaces. It is off by default, and the setting description states that “this feature disables critical security protections and makes it much easier for an attacker to compromise the machine.” The fact that this setting exists though is a vulnerability, showing perhaps the conflict between Microsoft’s desire to keep up in the AI agent wars, and the necessity for common sense security.\n\nTypeScript 7 is a big forthcoming release, introducing a new compiler and language service written in Go for native code performance. [According](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/progress-on-typescript-7-december-2025/) to principal product manager Daniel Rosenwasser, TypeScript 7 is far enough advanced that trying the native preview is worth it for developers. “You can expect faster load times, less memory usage, and a more snappy/responsive editor,” he said.\n\nIn this update, VS Code adds an experimental option to enable TypeScript 7, provided that TypeScript Go is installed and configured, which will then be used for TypeScript and JavaScript language features.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe team also mentions that the VS Code build scripts are now all in TypeScript, where before they were a mix of TypeScript and JavaScript. This has been enabled by TypeScript support in Node.js 22.18 and higher, showing the progress of TypeScript as a language that developers can use without friction.\n\nIntelliCode, which provides AI-assisted code completions (with a local model) for a number of languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java and C#, has been [deprecated](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dotnettools/issues/2537). Language servers will still provide code completion, syntax highlighting and more, but for AI-assisted completions, which came for free with IntelliCode, developers will now need to use Copilot. Copilot has 2,000 free completions per month after which a subscription is required. The IntelliCode extension has over 60 million users and is rated well by devleopers. “Why is this extension being deprecated and being migrated to Copilot?” [asks one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode&amp;ssr=false#review-details). Subscriptions may well be the answer, showing once again that although VS Code is open source and offers much for free, it is also driven by Microsoft with its own commercial goals.\n\nThe new release will likely be the last major update until February 2026 as the monthly update cycle skips December.\n\n[development](/tag/development) [ai-ml](/tag/ai-ml)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F12%2F11%2Fvs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode%2F1730665 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F12%2F11%2Fvs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode%2F1730665 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F12%2F11%2Fvs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode%2F1730665 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=VS%20Code%20update%20brings%20agent%20overload%2C%20TypeScript%207%20preview%2C%20and%20the%20end%20of%20IntelliCode%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F12%2F11%2Fvs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode%2F1730665 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F12%2F11%2Fvs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode%2F1730665&title=VS%20Code%20update%20brings%20agent%20overload%2C%20TypeScript%207%20preview%2C%20and%20the%20end%20of%20IntelliCode https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=VS%20Code%20update%20brings%20agent%20overload%2C%20TypeScript%207%20preview%2C%20and%20the%20end%20of%20IntelliCode%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2025%2F12%2F11%2Fvs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode%2F1730665\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
