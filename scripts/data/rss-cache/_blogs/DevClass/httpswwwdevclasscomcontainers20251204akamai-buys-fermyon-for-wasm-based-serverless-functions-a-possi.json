Fermyon Spin is a framework for building and running microservices on Wasmtime, and a related project called [SpinKube](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/overview/) enables Wasm workloads on Kubernetes.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev) is a Wasm runtime that is coded in Rust. It is open source and a project of the Bytecode Alliance. Since it runs Wasm, it supports programming languages that compile to Wasm including Rust, C, Python, C#, Go and Ruby. Wasmtime is lightweight, sandboxed, and starts up fast when used for serverless functions. When Wasmtime 1.0 was released in September 2022, Fermyon [said](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/wasmtime-1-0-fast-safe-and-production-ready) that “tens of thousands of WebAssembly binaries can run in a single Spin instance while keeping startup times under a millisecond.”\n\n![Fermyon Wasm functions already ran on Akamai's cloud, also known as Linode](https://image.devclass.com/1683638.webp?imageId=1683638&width=960&height=528&format=jpg)\n\nFermyon Wasm Functions already ran on Akamai’s cloud, also known as Linode\n\nAhead of the acquisition, Fermyon was already using Akamai for its Fermyon Wasm Functions, [introduced](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-fermyon-wasm-functions-on-akamai) in March 2025. Akamai [said this week](https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/akamai-announces-acquisition-of-function-as-a-service-company-fermyon) that Fermyon’s function-as-a-service (FaaS) capabilities would enable improved performance and lower costs compared to traditional cloud-native apps, though what “traditional” means in this context is not stated.\n\nAkamai began commercial operations as a content delivery network in 1999, since when it has built a global network with low-latency data delivery to most locations. The company already offers a FaaS solution called EdgeWorkers, based on the V8 JavaScript engine also used by Chrome, Chromium and Node.js. Although that sounds similar to what its competitor Cloudflare offers via Cloudflare Workers, it is Cloudflare that has a more advanced and better-known developer platform. Akamai and Cloudflare specialist Rohit Patil [said in September](https://rohitpatil.com/blog/cloudflare-vs-akamai-cdn-showdown.html) that the developer experience with EdgeWorkers “is more complex and less integrated than Cloudflare’s” and that Cloudflare’s developer platform “is years ahead in terms of vision, usability and ecosystem, making them the default choice for building new applications at the edge.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe Fermyon acquisition looks like an attempt to win back some ground with a solution that has some technical advantages over the V8 isolates (sandboxed JavaScript runtime environments) used by Cloudflare workers. The security boundary between isolates may be weak in comparison to the Wasmtime sandboxing. Cloudflare workers [do support Wasm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/webassembly/) but the docs warn of slower start-up.\n\nFermyon co-founder Mike Butcher [said](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/fermyon-joins-akamai) that open source contributions to the Spin framework, SpinKube and Wasmtime will continue.\n\n[development](/tag/development) [containers](/tag/containers)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F04%2Fakamai-buys-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers%2F1732513 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F04%2Fakamai-buys-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers%2F1732513 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F04%2Fakamai-buys-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers%2F1732513 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Akamai%20buys%20Fermyon%20for%20Wasm-based%20serverless%20functions%20%E2%80%93%20a%20possible%20answer%20to%20Cloudflare%20workers%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F04%2Fakamai-buys-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers%2F1732513 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F04%2Fakamai-buys-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers%2F1732513&title=Akamai%20buys%20Fermyon%20for%20Wasm-based%20serverless%20functions%20%E2%80%93%20a%20possible%20answer%20to%20Cloudflare%20workers https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Akamai%20buys%20Fermyon%20for%20Wasm-based%20serverless%20functions%20%E2%80%93%20a%20possible%20answer%20to%20Cloudflare%20workers%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fcontainers%2F2025%2F12%2F04%2Fakamai-buys-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers%2F1732513\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
