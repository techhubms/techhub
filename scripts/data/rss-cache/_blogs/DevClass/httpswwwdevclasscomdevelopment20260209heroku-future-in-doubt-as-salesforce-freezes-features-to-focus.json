Bhat, who leads the Heroku business unit within Salesforce, posted an [update](https://www.heroku.com/blog/an-update-on-heroku/) on the Heroku blog in which he stated that Heroku was \"transitioning to a sustaining engineering model.\" Users were [quick to conclude](https://old.reddit.com/r/Heroku/comments/1qxcttp/has_anyone_heard_about_the_shutdown_of_heroku/o3xd27b/) that \"they’re planning to coast from here out and let the product slowly degrade.\"\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nBhat said that enterprise account contracts will no longer be offered, though existing enterprise subscriptions will continue to be honored and renewed. New pay-as-you-go customers will still be accepted.\n\nHeroku was founded in 2007, initially as a platform for Ruby applications, and acquired by Salesforce in late 2010. Applications run in containers called dynos, and are easily scaled by adding more dynos or increasing their size. The platform is older than Docker and was revolutionary in providing easy deployment, often with a simple git push, alongside scalability.\n\nBlake Gentry, lead product engineer at Heroku in its early days following the Salesforce acquisition, [commented](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46919556) that \"Salesforce gave Heroku a ton of funding to build out a vision that was way ahead of its time … the launch of the multi language Cedar runtime in 2011 led to incredible growth,\" though he added that \"by 2012 we were drowning in tech debt and scaling challenges.\"\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe latest announcement has provoked surprise and disappointment in the community. \"Nothing else exists to fill this spot. Fly and others offer varying degrees of easier-than-AWS hosting, but nobody offers true PaaS like Heroku,\" said [another comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46921504).\n\nIn August last year, Gartner categorized Heroku as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for cloud-native application platforms. Last year Heroku gained a number of AI-related capabilities, including support for AI inference, and MCP (Model Control Protocol) support for use by AI agents. In April 2025 the team [introduced](https://www.heroku.com/blog/heroku-fir-generally-available-new-platform-capabilities/) the \"next generation of the Heroku platform, codenamed Fir,\" with support for standard cloud native buildpacks and an expanded range of Dyno options. In October, the company previewed [Heroku Vibes](https://www.heroku.com/blog/turn-ideas-into-apps-heroku-vibes-pilot/) for instant applications created with AI and natural language prompts.\n\nFir was made generally available, but only as part of the enterprise-only Private Space network-isolated environments.\n\nNon-enterprise customers now question whether this next generation runtime, the successor to Cedar, will every make it to the wider platform. \"We're waiting for general release but sounds like that's just not going to happen now. Which is a shame because it felt like the first real innovation in years,\" [said](https://old.reddit.com/r/Heroku/comments/1qxcttp/has_anyone_heard_about_the_shutdown_of_heroku/o41xaic/) one.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nHeroku remains widely admired, but with enterprise sales shut down and limited investment it now seems that decline is inevitable.\n\nThere are certainly other options. Fly.io offers a platform based on isolated execution environments called sprites. Other options in this space include Render, Vercel, Netlify and Cloudflare, or traditional cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure.\n\n[heroku](/tag/heroku) [development](/tag/development) [containers](/tag/containers) [salesforce](/tag/salesforce)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F09%2Fheroku-future-in-doubt-as-salesforce-freezes-features-to-focus-on-ai%2F4090238 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F09%2Fheroku-future-in-doubt-as-salesforce-freezes-features-to-focus-on-ai%2F4090238 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F09%2Fheroku-future-in-doubt-as-salesforce-freezes-features-to-focus-on-ai%2F4090238 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Heroku%20future%20in%20doubt%20as%20Salesforce%20freezes%20features%20to%20focus%20on%20AI%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F09%2Fheroku-future-in-doubt-as-salesforce-freezes-features-to-focus-on-ai%2F4090238 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F09%2Fheroku-future-in-doubt-as-salesforce-freezes-features-to-focus-on-ai%2F4090238&title=Heroku%20future%20in%20doubt%20as%20Salesforce%20freezes%20features%20to%20focus%20on%20AI https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Heroku%20future%20in%20doubt%20as%20Salesforce%20freezes%20features%20to%20focus%20on%20AI%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F09%2Fheroku-future-in-doubt-as-salesforce-freezes-features-to-focus-on-ai%2F4090238\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
