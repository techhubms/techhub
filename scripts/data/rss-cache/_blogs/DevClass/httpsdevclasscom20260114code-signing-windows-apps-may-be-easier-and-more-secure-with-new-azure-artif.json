The service, which was previewed as Trusted Signing, enables Windows developers to deploy applications without them being blocked or interrupted by pop-up warnings.\n\nThe new service uses certificates that are renewed daily and valid for only 24 hours. When code is signed, it is securely time-stamped so that the application remains signed after the certificate itself has expired, unless the certificate is revoked. The service costs $9.99 per month for up to 5,000 signatures with one certificate profile, or $99.99 per month for up to 100,000 signatures with 10 certificate profiles.\n\nMicrosoft said this week the service is [now generally available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-blog/simplifying-code-signing-for-windows-apps-artifact-signing-ga/4482789) – but only for organizations or individuals in the USA and Canada, or for organizations in the EU or UK. For organizations, certificates must use the “legal entity’s validated name”, such as that listed at the UK’s Companies House. There is a hint that “new region availability” is on the way as the service evolves.\n\nApplications can be signed via AAS using a number of different tools, including the signtool command-line utility that is part of the Windows SDK (software development kit). Specifically supported workflows include GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps tasks, PowerShell, and a dedicated Artifact Signing SDK.\n\n![The Azure Artifact Signing service has both Basic and Premium plans](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/artifact-signing-resource-structure-overview.png)The Azure Artifact Signing service has both Basic and Premium plans\n\nThese certificates are not Extended Validation (EV) and the [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/artifact-signing/faq) states that “there is no plan to issue EV certificates.” EV certificates from third parties are priced at a premium and intended to convey greater reassurance, via more extensive identity checks.\n\nThe certificates issued by AAS will work on versions of Windows back to Windows 7.0 SP1, [provided](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5022661-windows-support-for-the-trusted-signing-formerly-azure-code-signing-program-4b505a31-fa1e-4ea6-85dd-6630229e8ef4) that a required Microsoft root certificate authority is installed. This should be automatic for computers with internet access.\n\nTraditionally, Windows applications were signed via a code-signing certificate obtained from a third-party. The certificate provider verified the identity of the developer, who would then download the certificate and use it to sign applications, typically with signtool. It is near-essential for deployment. Although it is possible to run an unsigned application on Windows, doing so means approving warnings regarding the risks of executables from unknown publishers. In an enterprise environment, admins can [configure policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/applocker/working-with-applocker-policies) to prevent unsigned applications from running.\n\nThe old approach, where long-lived certificates were installed on a developer PC, was vulnerable to theft and misuse, and the industry has tightened the requirements. The [latest](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/code-signing/requirements/) can be found at the Certificate Authority Browser Forum (CABF) and include storage of the certificate in a Hardware Crypto Module (HCM), for example a secure USB device, in place since June 1 2023. Newer requirements include not supporting the SHA-1 algorithm, and from March 1 2026, a maximum validity of 460 days. This has increased the cost of third-party certificates, especially when a USB device is included. Signing with USB devices is also impractical for cloud-based workflows. AAS exceeds the validity requirement, with a lifetime of just one day.\n\nManaging code signing certificates is a burden for developers. AAS is relatively inexpensive; the documentation for Electron, a popular cross-platform framework, [states](https://www.electronforge.io/guides/code-signing/code-signing-windows) that it is “the cheapest option for code signing on Windows.” Code signing for a Mac requires a separate certificate and process managed by Apple, at further cost.\n\nAAS looks like a welcome new service, though along with the regional limitations there are plenty of things that can go wrong. The FAQ is worth reading carefully. Among other things, it notes how critical it is to have the correct documents and to respond to validation emails.\n\n[## Docker Hardened Images now free, devs give cautious welcome](https://devclass.com/2025/12/18/docker-hardened-images-now-free-devs-give-cautious-welcome/)[## Security researcher exploits GitHub gotcha, gets admin access to all Istio repositories and more](https://devclass.com/2025/07/03/security-researcher-exploits-github-gotcha-gets-admin-access-to-all-istio-repositories-and-more/)[## \"Serious\" MySQL bug celebrates 20 years unfixed - another reason to switch to PostgreSQL?](https://devclass.com/2025/06/24/serious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql/)[## Misconfigured GitHub Actions could leave repos and secrets exposed, Sysdig finds](https://devclass.com/2025/06/18/misconfigured-github-actions-could-leave-repos-and-secrets-exposed-sysdig-finds/)[## Redefining identity security in the age of agentic AI](https://devclass.com/2025/06/17/redefining-identity-security-in-the-age-of-agentic-ai/)[## Cursor AI editor hits 1.0 milestone, including BugBot and high-risk background agents](https://devclass.com/2025/06/06/cursor-ai-editor-hits-1-0-milestone-including-bugbot-and-high-risk-background-agents/)[## Researchers warn of prompt injection vulnerability in GitHub MCP with no obvious fix](https://devclass.com/2025/05/27/researchers-warn-of-prompt-injection-vulnerability-in-github-mcp-with-no-obvious-fix/)[## MCP will be built into Windows to make an 'agentic OS' but security will be a key concern](https://devclass.com/2025/05/19/mcp-will-be-built-into-windows-to-make-an-agentic-os-but-security-will-be-a-key-concern/)[## PHP security audit of critical code reveals flaws, fixed in new release](https://devclass.com/2025/04/14/php-security-audit-of-critical-code-reveals-flaws-fixed-in-new-release/)[## The risks of GitHub Actions: Researcher describes severe potential of CodeQL vulnerability, now fixe...](https://devclass.com/2025/04/02/the-risks-of-github-actions-researcher-describes-severe-potential-of-codeql-vulnerability-now-fixed/)[## Next.js team fixes vuln that allows auth bypass when middleware is used, revises documentation recom...](https://devclass.com/2025/03/24/next-js-team-fixes-vuln-that-allows-authorization-bypass-when-middleware-is-used-hastily-revises-documentation-recommending-this-method/)[## Third-party libraries cause more security woes than first-party code, open-source flaws take longer ...](https://devclass.com/2025/03/11/third-party-libraries-cause-more-security-woes-than-first-party-code-open-source-flaws-take-longer-to-fix/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
