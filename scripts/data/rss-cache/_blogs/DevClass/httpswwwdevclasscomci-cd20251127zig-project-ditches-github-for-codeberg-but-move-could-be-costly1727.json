Kelley [said](https://ziglang.org/news/migrating-from-github-to-codeberg/) Zig has already been migrated and from yesterday the GitHub repository has been made read-only. GitHub issues (bug reports and discussions) and pull requests (proposed code changes) have not been migrated.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nKelley gave several reasons for the move, including poor performance which he attributed to JavaScript framework changes (as we [reported](https://devclass.com/2025/01/29/more-react-more-app-like-github-engineer-outlines-future-ui-for-its-devops-platform/) in January), and unreliable Actions, used for continuous integration and continuous delivery, which he said are “completely neglected” and on which jobs run “seemingly at random.”\n\nKelley also objected to GitHub’s embrace of AI, which runs counter to the Zig project’s [policy](https://ziglang.org/code-of-conduct/#strict-no-llm-no-ai-policy) of disallowing use of large language models (LLMs) for issues, pull requests or comments. He referenced several violations of this policy and believes GitHub’s constant promotion of AI is one factor in this.\n\n![Never mind the money: GitHub's sponsor programme was the single biggest source of income for the Zig Foundation in 2024](https://image.devclass.com/2922070.webp?imageId=2922070&width=960&height=742&format=jpg)\n\nNever mind the money: GitHub’s sponsor programme was the single biggest source of income for the Zig Foundation in 2024\n\nThe main problem with leaving GitHub, Kelley said, is that GitHub Sponsors, a programme which makes it easy to donate to the project, provides a substantial part of the Zig Software Foundation’s income. In 2024 it was the largest single source of income with more than $170,000 donated.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n“We consider it a liability,” said Kelley, requesting that sponsors use a different channel such as Every.org, itself a non-profit.\n\nGitHub was acquired by Microsoft in June 2018, at which time it was [stated](https://news.microsoft.com/source/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/) that GitHub would continue to be “operated independently to provide an open platform for all developers.” That status [changed](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/11/github_head_ankles_as_microsoft/) in August this year, when GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke stepped down and was not replaced, with the business now part of Microsoft’s CoreAI division, which also includes developer and AI platform products.\n\nCodeberg now hosts upwards of 320,000 projects, using its open source [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) software which can also be self-hosted. Use of Codeberg is free but it is only for open source projects; the [terms of use](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/org/src/commit/ff5180f0ac5621fa22acc6f02691f5b072076ff7/TermsOfUse.md#2-allowed-content-usage) only allow private repositories under limited circumstances such as “things required for FLOSS [free/libre open source software], like storing secrets, team-internal discussions or hiding projects from the public until they’re ready.” GitHub, by contrast, allows private repositories for commercial use even with free accounts.\n\nResponse to Kelley’s move is mixed. There is some dissatisfaction with GitHub, mainly related to UI (user interface) performance and intrusive AI features; but also frustration with the Zig project, with one developer on Reddit [saying](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1p7up3u/the_zig_language_repository_is_migrating_from/nr0nm9s/) the sudden migration is one in a growing list of mis-steps “including constantly breaking everyone’s code, making unused variables an error despite users’ pleas, and making fun of said users.” Kelley’s intemperate language also comes in for negative criticism; and some find the performance of Codeberg no better than that of GitHub.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nAnother issue is that the popularity of GitHub adds friction to projects that move elsewhere. “You’re running what aims to be a major programming language – have it where people expect and live with your gripes about the platform,” [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46065521) a comment on Hacker News.\n\nThe implication is that Zig’s move is not necessarily one that will be widely followed, even by open source projects.\n\nThat said, the demand from developers for a snappy interface and less AI dominance on GitHub is substantial, though Microsoft seems resistant to such pushback.\n\n[development](/tag/development) [ci-cd](/tag/ci-cd)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fci-cd%2F2025%2F11%2F27%2Fzig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly%2F1727053 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fci-cd%2F2025%2F11%2F27%2Fzig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly%2F1727053 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fci-cd%2F2025%2F11%2F27%2Fzig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly%2F1727053 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Zig%20project%20ditches%20GitHub%20for%20Codeberg%20but%20move%20could%20be%20costly%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fci-cd%2F2025%2F11%2F27%2Fzig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly%2F1727053 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fci-cd%2F2025%2F11%2F27%2Fzig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly%2F1727053&title=Zig%20project%20ditches%20GitHub%20for%20Codeberg%20but%20move%20could%20be%20costly https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Zig%20project%20ditches%20GitHub%20for%20Codeberg%20but%20move%20could%20be%20costly%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fci-cd%2F2025%2F11%2F27%2Fzig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly%2F1727053\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
