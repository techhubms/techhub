Any MCP client can use tools including project discovery, file management, building and testing, and documentation.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n\"We'll be adding more in the future,\" said Xcode director Ken Orr in an [introductory video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/tech-talks/111428/).\n\nAlthough Codex appears to have equal integration, it seems that Anthropic is the preferred choice. [According to Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/apple-xcode-claude-agent-sdk), Xcode 26.3 \"introduces a native integration with the Claude Agent SDK, the same underlying harness that powers Claude Code.\"\n\nGoogle's Gemini is not mentioned, although the company's Antigravity AI editor will be a beneficiary of the new MCP servers in Xcode. Apple has a [deal with Google](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/12/apple_taps_google_gemini_siri/) to power Siri  but it seems that developers are pointed elsewhere for AI coding.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nOrr does not mention either security or privacy in his introduction, but the [release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-26_3-release-notes) for the preview highlight some issues regarding Apple's \"privacy-protected folders,\" such as Desktop, Downloads, and Documents. Devs who deny access to Claude or Codex may not be able to reverse the decision, and the notes suggest using a new location outside those folders. This may be fixed in the final release, but it is a reminder that these agents can send data to third-party models. Apple's note on the subject states that \"the third-party model provider's data privacy policies will apply.\"\n\nChoosing his words carefully, Orr showed a sample coding experience in which the agent generated 400 lines of code in a tourism app and said: \"What would have taken me hours is now a great first draft, ready for me to review and refine.\" This presumes that the developer has both the skills and the motivation to do that review with diligence.\n\nAnthropic [recently published](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/02/anthropic-research-skilled-devs-make-better-use-of-ai-but-using-ai-is-bad-for-learning-skills/4079561) research suggesting that skilled developers gain productivity from use of AI assistance, but that those with fewer skills have no significant productivity gain and also learn less than those not using AI.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThese doubts are unlikely to diminish adoption of agentic AI coding in Xcode or elsewhere. An early user of the product [said](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1quz86o/xcode_263_unlocks_the_power_of_agentic_coding/o3epjr7/) that previously Visual Studio Code had better AI tooling, but \"this update challenges this pretty hard. This is the best Claude code integration in an IDE I have seen so far.\"\n\nOthers are more skeptical, with Xcode not having the best reputation for ease of use and productivity. Another dev [described](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46874953) the AI integration as \"building castles in the sky while the foundation is rotting away.\"\n\n[software](/tag/software) [ai-ml](/tag/ai-ml) [apple](/tag/apple) [anthropic](/tag/anthropic)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fapple-embraces-agentic-ai-development-with-xcode-263%2F4090111 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fapple-embraces-agentic-ai-development-with-xcode-263%2F4090111 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fapple-embraces-agentic-ai-development-with-xcode-263%2F4090111 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Apple%20embraces%20agentic%20AI%20development%20with%20Xcode%2026.3%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fapple-embraces-agentic-ai-development-with-xcode-263%2F4090111 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fapple-embraces-agentic-ai-development-with-xcode-263%2F4090111&title=Apple%20embraces%20agentic%20AI%20development%20with%20Xcode%2026.3 https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Apple%20embraces%20agentic%20AI%20development%20with%20Xcode%2026.3%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fapple-embraces-agentic-ai-development-with-xcode-263%2F4090111\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
