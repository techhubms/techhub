The complexity of the ecosystem is a problem. \"Getting a build and testing harness and CI system and IDE tools to all play nicely together is reliably a nightmare,\" complained one respondent.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nDespite such concerns, React usage remains high and may grow further thanks to AI. \"With generative AI's reliance on existing codebases in order to spew out new code, could React become even more entrenched?\" asks Devographics writer Sacha Greif, introducing the [survey](https://2025.stateofreact.com/en-US/).\n\n![React API top pain points according to the 2025 State of React survey. Note that forwardRef was deprecated in React 19.](https://image.devclass.com/4091381.webp?imageId=4091381&width=960&height=548&format=jpg)\n\nReact API top pain points according to the 2025 State of React survey. Note that forwardRef was deprecated in React 19.\n\nNext.js, which once looked set to become the standard choice for full-stack React, is widely used but not the best-liked. 80 percent have used it, but 17 percent have a negative sentiment, with most complaints focused on excessive complexity and too-tight integration with its main sponsor, hosting company Vercel. \"Vendor lock in, complex APIs, and too much noise in the Next.js ecosystem make it a no-go for me,\" said one comment – though 27 percent ticked the box for positive sentiment, so it divides opinion.\n\nIf Next.js declines, the winner may be TanStack. TanStack Query, used for data fetching, has 68 percent usage, 42 percent positive sentiment, and just 1 percent negative. TanStack Start, a full-stack framework using React, Solid.js and the Vite build tool currently in release candidate phase, is used by only 15 percent, probably because it is in preview, but liked by nearly half of those who use it or have heard of it.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nTanStack is an open-source project created by Tanner Lindsey, co-founder of SEO (search engine optimization) rank tracking company Nozzle. In March 20025 it was [sponsored](https://www.devclass.com/development/2025/03/21/netlify-becomes-official-deployment-host-for-tanstack-as-alternative-to-nextjs-and-vendor-lock-in/1623171) by hosting company Netlify as an alternative to \"bloated, over-abstracted frameworks,\" perhaps with Next.js in mind. TanStack is focused on type-safety using TypeScript and file-based routing.\n\nThere are several TanStack sub-projects, in varying states of readiness. Alongside Query and Start, others include the TanStack DB data store (beta), TanStack AI (alpha) and TanStack CLI (command line interface), including an MCP (model context protocol) server for use by AI agents.\n\nBoth Next.js and TanStack Start implement React Server Components, but respondents are not all convinced that React belongs on the server as well as in the browser. \"Completely not interested in this feature,\" said one respondent. The cool response to both server component and server functions is described by the survey authors as \"troubling for a set of new APIs that was supposed to pave the way towards React’s next big evolution.\"\n\nAnother newish feature, the React Compiler, fares better, with 62 percent of respondents stating their enthusiasm for it. \"We can stop littering our code with useMemo and useCallback,\" said Aurora Scharff, certification lead and React educator, in her conclusion to the survey.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nRespondents are also positive about the planned React Foundation, introduced in October 2025 to maintain React’s infrastructure and organize its main event, ReactConf.\n\nLike Greif, Scharff notes that for AI-assisted coding, \"React has … become the default output when you prompt for UI.\"\n\nDespite its pain points, the future popularity of React seems assured.\n\n[javascript](/tag/javascript) [development](/tag/development) [tanstack](/tag/tanstack) [react](/tag/react) [typescript](/tag/typescript) [meta](/tag/meta)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F18%2Fas-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay%2F4091379 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F18%2Fas-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay%2F4091379 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F18%2Fas-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay%2F4091379 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=React%20survey%20shows%20TanStack%20gains%2C%20doubts%20over%20server%20components%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F18%2Fas-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay%2F4091379 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F18%2Fas-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay%2F4091379&title=React%20survey%20shows%20TanStack%20gains%2C%20doubts%20over%20server%20components https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=React%20survey%20shows%20TanStack%20gains%2C%20doubts%20over%20server%20components%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2026%2F02%2F18%2Fas-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay%2F4091379\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
