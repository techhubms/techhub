The remaining staff are three co-founders, plus Robin Malfait and Peter Suhm.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[According](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388#issuecomment-3717222957) to Wathan, Tailwind usage is “growing faster than it ever has” but revenue is down by almost 80 percent. The reason he gave is that use of AI tools and agents means traffic to the documentation on the website has dropped by 40 percent in two years, meaning developers do not discover the commercial plans which sustain the business.\n\nTailwind CSS is the most popular CSS framework among respondents to the [2025 State of CSS survey](https://2025.stateofcss.com/en-US/other-tools/), used by 51 percent of them. Along with sponsorships, the project is monetized by [component packages](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks#pricing), available for application UIs (user interfaces), marketing websites, ecommerce sites, or all three together as Tailwind Plus. These are inexpensive lifetime subscriptions – but if AI fetches and installs Tailwind CSS behind the scenes, or answers questions in chat so that developers never visit the site, the commercial plans will not be seen or purchased.\n\nThe consequent financial pressure on Tailwind Labs was revealed when an open source contributor sought to merge an update to the documentation that merged all the text into one file optimized for LLM (large language model) consumption. Wathan closed the GitHub issue stating that the update would make the business “even less sustainable.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n![Tailwind CSS is the most popular CSS framework according to the 2025 State of CSS survey](https://image.devclass.com/4079586.webp?imageId=4079586&width=960&height=578&format=jpg)\n\nTailwind CSS is the most popular framework according to the 2025 State of CSS survey\n\nUsers pushed back, saying that closing the issue was “very OSS [open source software] unfriendly” and making the software easier to use would increase take-up – prompting the outburst from Wathan. The CEO said that fixing the sustainability of the project was his first priority, to avoid Tailwind CSS becoming “unmaintained abandonware when there is no one left employed to work on it.”\n\nAnother observation was that the value of packaging best-practice components has dropped because of AI. “The UI kit costs $299! I can run thousands of AI queries for that price and customize whatever I feel like,” [argued](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/pull/2388#issuecomment-3720447637) one user, who said he has a commercial package but does not use it.\n\nIt is also possible that offering lifetime subscriptions makes sustainability harder, since new revenue has to come from new customers. The Tailwind plans even include future updates. A better strategy would be “gatekeeping features behind new major versions where you need to pay for an upgraded license,” [said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46539450) another developer.\n\nYesterday Wathan posted an [X podcast](https://x.com/adamwathan/status/2008909129591443925) about the business sustainability issues. Following forecasts during the holiday break, he had concluded that “if nothing changed, then in about six months we would no longer be able to meet payroll obligations.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nWathan said in [another post](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/14677#discussioncomment-15435530) that he is “excited about AI” but still trying to work out how Tailwind can “thrive in this new world.”\n\nAlthough issues with open source sustainability are not new, the explosion of AI tools is having a dramatic impact; the collapse of Stack Overflow questions is [another example](https://devclass.com/2026/01/05/dramatic-drop-in-stack-overflow-questions-as-devs-look-elsewhere-for-help/).\n\nThe Tailwind CSS framework is well-liked, and it is probable that AI tooling has increased its usage while at the same time harming the business model behind it.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n**Update at 09.19 on January 9, 2026, to add:**\n\nFollowing publicity for Tailwind’s situation, new sponsors have come forward. Vercel founder [Guillermo Rauch said on X](https://x.com/rauchg/status/2009336725043335338) that his company will sponsor Tailwind CSS, and that “Tailwind is foundational web infrastructure at this point (it fixed CSS).”\n\nIn addition, Logan Kilpatrick, group product manager for Google AI Studio, [said](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/2009339263251566902) that “we (the GoogleAIStudio team) are now a sponsor of the @tailwindcss project.”\n\n[ai-ml](/tag/ai-ml) [development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F01%2F08%2Ftailwind-labs-lays-off-75-percent-of-its-engineers-thanks-to-brutal-impact-of-ai%2F4079571 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F01%2F08%2Ftailwind-labs-lays-off-75-percent-of-its-engineers-thanks-to-brutal-impact-of-ai%2F4079571 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F01%2F08%2Ftailwind-labs-lays-off-75-percent-of-its-engineers-thanks-to-brutal-impact-of-ai%2F4079571 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Tailwind%20Labs%20lays%20off%2075%20percent%20of%20its%20engineers%20thanks%20to%20 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fai-ml%2F2026%2F01%2F08%2Ftailwind-labs-lays-off-75-percent-of-its-engineers-thanks-to-brutal-impact-of-ai%2F4079571&title=Tailwind%20Labs%20lays%20off%2075%20percent%20of%20its%20engineers%20thanks%20to%20 https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Tailwind%20Labs%20lays%20off%2075%20percent%20of%20its%20engineers%20thanks%20to%20\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
