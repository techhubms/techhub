He noted though that Android 16 devices based on the 6.12 Linux kernel ship with ashmem (anonymous shared memory subsystem) memory allocator, built with Rust, which means that millions of devices already use Rust for Linux in production.\n\nA key project is [gccrs](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs), an implementation of Rust on top of the GCC (GNU compiler collection), which is not yet complete. LWN’s Jonathan Corbet [reported](https://lwn.net/Articles/1050174/) that “the gccrs developers see building the kernel as one of their top priorities; Ojeda said to expect some interesting news from that project next year.”\n\nThe plan, according to Corbet’s report, is that it will always be possible to build the kernel with the version of Rust included in the latest Debian stable release. The Debian project has [said](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/03/debian_apt_to_require_rust/) that Rust will have “hard Rust requirements” in its APT (advanced package tool) package manager from May 2026. Corbet also reports that Dave Airlie, maintainer for DRM (Direct Rendering Manager), a Linux subsystem which is part of the graphics stack, said at the summit that the DRM project was about a year away from requiring Rust and disallowing C for new drivers.\n\nLinux maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman said during the discussion that drivers in Rust were proving safer than those written in C, a good endorsement for the use of Rust since memory safety is the key reason to support it. Issues with interaction between Rust code and the core kernel written in C had been fewer than expected, Kroah-Hartman said.\n\nThere are some downsides to requiring Rust support, particularly for chip architectures that have low usage, such as IBM s390 systems. Another concern is that a formal specification for Rust remains [work in progress](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3355-rust-spec.html).\n\nLinux adoption is a boost for Rust, and Ojeda expressed the hope that “companies and other entities” will invest in it by “giving time to their kernel developers to train themselves in Rust.”\n\nIn the 2024 State of Rust survey, the [top developer concern](https://devclass.com/2025/02/18/state-of-rust-survey-2024-most-rust-developers-worry-about-the-future-of-the-language/) for the future was “not enough usage in the tech industry.” 2025 has been a good year for Rust and those concerns now look less pressing.\n\n[## VS Code update brings agent overload, TypeScript 7 preview, and the end of IntelliCode](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/vs-code-update-brings-agent-overload-typescript-7-preview-and-the-end-of-intellicode/)[## Research: AI can help or hinder software development, and old-style best practices make the differen...](https://devclass.com/2025/12/11/research-ai-can-help-or-hinder-software-development-and-old-style-best-practices-make-the-difference/)[## JetBrains abandons Fleet IDE, pins hopes on forthcoming Air agentic development tool](https://devclass.com/2025/12/09/jetbrains-abandons-fleet-ide-pins-hopes-on-forthcoming-air-agentic-development-tool/)[## AWS shows Rust love at re:Invent: 10 times faster than Kotlin, one tenth the latency of Go](https://devclass.com/2025/12/08/aws-shows-rust-love-at-reinvent-10-times-faster-than-kotlin-one-tenth-the-latency-of-go/)[## Akamai buys Fermyon for Wasm-based serverless functions – a possible answer to Cloudflare workers](https://devclass.com/2025/12/04/akamai-acquires-fermyon-for-wasm-based-serverless-functions-a-possible-answer-to-cloudflare-workers/)[## Bun JavaScript runtime acquired by Anthropic, tying its future to AI coding](https://devclass.com/2025/12/03/bun-javascript-runtime-acquired-by-anthropic-tying-its-future-to-ai-coding/)[## Zig project ditches GitHub for Codeberg but move could be costly](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/zig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly/)[## Google's Chromium team decides it will add JPEG XL support, reverses 'obsolete' declaration](https://devclass.com/2025/11/24/googles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration/)[## Copilot .Net modernization tool a 'huge downgrade,' devs say – and no longer free](https://devclass.com/2025/11/20/copilot-net-modernization-tool-a-huge-downgrade-devs-say-and-no-longer-free/)[## We take a look at Google's Antigravity: Agentic AI development but some frustrations for early adopt...](https://devclass.com/2025/11/19/googles-antigravity-arrives-agentic-ai-development-but-frustrating-for-early-adopters/)[## Google VP of development explains how 'citizen developers' must be tempered by the pros](https://devclass.com/2025/07/18/google-vp-of-development-explains-how-citizen-developers-must-be-tempered-by-the-pros/)[## Hands on with Kiro, the AWS preview of an agentic AI IDE driven by specifications](https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
