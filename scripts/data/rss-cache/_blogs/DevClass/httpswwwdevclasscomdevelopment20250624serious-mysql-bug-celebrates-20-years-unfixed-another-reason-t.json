The bug shows that if the specified table is updated indirectly, because of a relationship to another table, then the trigger does not execute.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nShortly after the bug was posted the team commented that it was a “known problem” and that “we will fix this in 5.1” but it was not fixed, though it was documented in the manual, which [states](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-8.0-en/create-trigger.html) that “cascaded foreign key actions do not activate triggers.”\n\nDevelopers commenting to the bug report noted that the bug “is threatening ACID/integrity big time” and then in 2015 that “we just started suffering this issue after trying to implement triggers on cascade delete. Please a fix would be really appreciated.” ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durablity.\n\nIn 2020 a young developer mentioned that “this bug is older than me.”\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe bug is significant. In 2023 another developer mentioned that “we moved away from MySQL years ago – this bug was the last straw. We needed data integrity for a custom account platform.”\n\nMySQL was acquired by Oracle in 2010 as part of Sun Microsystems, and although this particular bug pre-dates Oracle’s involvement, it could be perceived as evidence of neglect. Another argument is that long-standing and documented defects like this one are safer left unfixed, in case some application has come to depend on it, though in this example that looks unlikely.\n\nMariaDB, a MySQL fork which dates back to the Oracle acquisition, [also has this bug](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-12302) marked “unresolved”.\n\nA [discussion on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1lgvfvb/happy_20th_birthday_to_mysqls_triggers_not/) includes a debate over whether use of triggers for database integrity is or is not best practice, and another common response, “the workaround is not using MySQL, but a sane relational db.” The most common alternative choice is PostgreSQL.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nAnother remarked that “at this point it’s a feature.”\n\n![](https://image.devclass.com/116487.webp?imageId=116487&width=960&height=642&format=jpg)\n\nThe DB-Engines ranking shows the continuing popularity of MySQL, but also its significant decline in recent years\n\nAccording to the [DB-Engines ranking](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking), MySQL remains the second most widely used database manager behind Oracle, and ahead of Microsoft SQL Server in third place. MySQL is trending down though, and PostgreSQL is climbing. The ranking is based on mentions and job offers rather than actual usage data, so cannot be taken too seriously, but is some evidence of MySQL decline.\n\nLast year Percona’s Peter Zaitsev, who has worked with MySQL for many years, [told The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/11/early_mysql_engineer_questions_whether/) that “MySQL seems to suffer from years of neglect in the performance engineering department” and expressed his opinion that Oracle is sidelining the open source MySQL by making important new features exclusive to the cloud-based Heatwave.\n\n[development](/tag/development) [security](/tag/security)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F24%2Fserious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql%2F101178 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F24%2Fserious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql%2F101178 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F24%2Fserious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql%2F101178 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=%22Serious%22%20MySQL%20bug%20celebrates%2020%20years%20unfixed%20-%20another%20reason%20to%20switch%20to%20PostgreSQL%3F%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F24%2Fserious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql%2F101178 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F24%2Fserious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql%2F101178&title=%22Serious%22%20MySQL%20bug%20celebrates%2020%20years%20unfixed%20-%20another%20reason%20to%20switch%20to%20PostgreSQL%3F https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=%22Serious%22%20MySQL%20bug%20celebrates%2020%20years%20unfixed%20-%20another%20reason%20to%20switch%20to%20PostgreSQL%3F%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F06%2F24%2Fserious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql%2F101178\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
