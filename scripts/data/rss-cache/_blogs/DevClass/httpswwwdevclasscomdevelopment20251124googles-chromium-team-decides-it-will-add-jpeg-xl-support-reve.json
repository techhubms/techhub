Greg Farough, campaigns manager at the free software foundation, [said](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/googles-decision-to-deprecate-jpeg-xl-emphasizes-the-need-for-browser-choice-and-free-formats) at the time that the decision showed that “Google Chrome is the arbiter of web standards,” and that the company was acting in its own interests, not those of web users.\n\nMost of the factors Byers cited are longstanding, so why the change of heart? It may be that forthcoming inclusion in the PDF specification tipped the balance, though Byers also noted a post last month previewing [relevant results](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/issues/994#issuecomment-3416932563) from the State of HTML survey, which was co-sponsored by Google. The survey showed demand for JPEG XL as among the top pain points cited by developers among proposals for interop 2026, a cross-company project to increase interoperability among web browsers.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nThe reference implementation of JPEG XL is [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl), written in C++, which also formed the basis for the earlier Chromium experiment. This is unlikely to be used this time round, noting that Byers requested a “memory-safe” decoder. The obvious alternative is a [Rust implementation](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/7184969) based on jxl-rs from Google Research. The owner of the Rust-based proposal is Chromium committer Helmut Januschka, who is head of engineering at Austrian media company Krone Multimedia. [Januschka](https://www.januschka.com/) has opened a [new issue](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/462919304) to add JPEG XL support to Chromium using Rust.\n\nThis is a big step forward for JPEG XL, but its future is not yet assured. Support in Safari is incomplete, lacking animation support or progressive decoding, and few applications currently export to JPEG XL. But in the chicken-and-egg world of web standards, a Chromium decoder will provide a strong incentive for other applications to add support.\n\n[development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F11%2F24%2Fgoogles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration%2F1730949 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F11%2F24%2Fgoogles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration%2F1730949 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F11%2F24%2Fgoogles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration%2F1730949 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Google https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F11%2F24%2Fgoogles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration%2F1730949&title=Google https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Google\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
