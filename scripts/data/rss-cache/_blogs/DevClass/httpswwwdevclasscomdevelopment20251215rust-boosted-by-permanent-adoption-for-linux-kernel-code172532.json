He noted though that Android 16 devices based on the 6.12 Linux kernel ship with ashmem (anonymous shared memory subsystem) memory allocator, built with Rust, which means that millions of devices already use Rust for Linux in production.\n\nA key project is [gccrs](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs), an implementation of Rust on top of the GCC (GNU compiler collection), which is not yet complete. LWN’s Jonathan Corbet [reported](https://lwn.net/Articles/1050174/) that “the gccrs developers see building the kernel as one of their top priorities; Ojeda said to expect some interesting news from that project next year.”\n\nThe plan, according to Corbet’s report, is that it will always be possible to build the kernel with the version of Rust included in the latest Debian stable release. The Debian project has [said](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/03/debian_apt_to_require_rust/) that Rust will have “hard Rust requirements” in its APT (advanced package tool) package manager from May 2026. Corbet also reports that Dave Airlie, maintainer for DRM (Direct Rendering Manager), a Linux subsystem which is part of the graphics stack, said at the summit that the DRM project was about a year away from requiring Rust and disallowing C for new drivers.\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\nLinux maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman said during the discussion that drivers in Rust were proving safer than those written in C, a good endorsement for the use of Rust since memory safety is the key reason to support it. Issues with interaction between Rust code and the core kernel written in C had been fewer than expected, Kroah-Hartman said.\n\nThere are some downsides to requiring Rust support, particularly for chip architectures that have low usage, such as IBM s390 systems. Another concern is that a formal specification for Rust remains [work in progress](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3355-rust-spec.html).\n\nLinux adoption is a boost for Rust, and Ojeda expressed the hope that “companies and other entities” will invest in it by “giving time to their kernel developers to train themselves in Rust.”\n\nIn the 2024 State of Rust survey, the [top developer concern](https://devclass.com/2025/02/18/state-of-rust-survey-2024-most-rust-developers-worry-about-the-future-of-the-language/) for the future was “not enough usage in the tech industry.” 2025 has been a good year for Rust and those concerns now look less pressing.\n\n[development](/tag/development)\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F15%2Frust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code%2F1725322 https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F15%2Frust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code%2F1725322 https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F15%2Frust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code%2F1725322 https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Rust%20boosted%20by%20permanent%20adoption%20for%20Linux%20kernel%20code%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F15%2Frust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code%2F1725322 https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F15%2Frust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code%2F1725322&title=Rust%20boosted%20by%20permanent%20adoption%20for%20Linux%20kernel%20code https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Rust%20boosted%20by%20permanent%20adoption%20for%20Linux%20kernel%20code%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.devclass.com%2Fdevelopment%2F2025%2F12%2F15%2Frust-boosted-by-permanent-adoption-for-linux-kernel-code%2F1725322\n\nDEVCLASS AD\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/2920838.jpg?imageId=2920838&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Godot maintainers struggle with 'draining and demoralizing' AI slop submissions\nPopular game engine appeals for more maintainer funding to handle surge of useless pull requests February 19, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ai-ml/2026/02/19/github-itself-to-blame-for-ai-slop-prs-say-devs/4091420)\n\n[## React survey shows TanStack gains, doubts over server components Frustrations with Next.js may drive TanStack Start adoption February 18, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/18/as-the-default-ui-for-ai-generated-apps-react-is-here-to-stay/4091379)\n\n[## GitHub previews Agentic Workflows as part of continuous AI concept February 17, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/ci-cd/2026/02/17/github-previews-agentic-workflows-as-part-of-continuous-ai-concept/4091356)\n\n[## Anthropic updates to hide Claude’s AI actions, devs hate it February 16, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/16/claude-code-gets-more-opaque-devs-want-more-transparency/4091233)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1621996.jpg?imageId=1621996&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft's sudden deprecation of Polyglot Notebooks leaves users fuming\nFebruary 14, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/databases/2026/02/14/microsoft-deprecates-polyglot-notebooks-developers-react/4091167)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/1624894.jpg?imageId=1624894&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## Microsoft delivers first preview of .NET 11 and C# 15\nFebruary 13, 2026](https://www.devclass.com/development/2026/02/13/net-train-keeps-rolling-with-first-showing-of-2026-release/4090277)\n\n[!\\[\\](https://image.devclass.com/4090265.jpg?imageId=4090265&panox=0.00&panoy=0.00&panow=100.00&panoh=100.00&heightx=0.00&heighty=0.00&heightw=100.00&heighth=100.00&width=960&height=432&format=webp&format=jpg)\n## JavaScript survey reveals gripes against date handling, Webpack and Next.js -
