Small changes in phrasing can lead to big improvements in results.\n\nLet’s recap the four recipes.\n\nRecipe 1: The Persona Pattern\n\nGive Copilot a role to think from a specific point of view.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`Act as a senior backend developer. Review this API method for edge cases.`\n\n**Use it when:**\n\n- You want answers framed by experience.\n- You need reviews, tests, or explanations with a specific mindset.\n\nRecipe 2: The Reflection Pattern\n\nAsk Copilot to explain or review its own answer.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`Explain the reasoning behind this code suggestion.`\n\n**Use it when:**\n\n- Generated code feels unclear.\n- You want transparency before accepting a change.\n\nRecipe 3: The Refusal Breaker Pattern\n\nRephrase requests when Copilot says no or hesitates.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`Explain best practices for securing an API against injection attacks.`\n\n**Use it when:**\n\n- A request feels too broad or sensitive.\n- You want guidance instead of a direct solution.\n\nRecipe 4: The Cognitive Verifier Pattern\n\nLet Copilot ask clarifying questions before answering.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`Before answering, list clarifying questions to better understand this request.`\n\n**Use it when:**\n\n- Requirements are vague.\n- You are planning a feature or reviewing an issue.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nYou do not have to use just one pattern at a time. These recipes work even better when combined.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Use a Persona to set perspective.\n- Add Reflection for explanation.\n- Apply a Cognitive Verifier to clarify scope.\n\nThat’s Context Engineering in action.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nGitHub Copilot works best when the conversation is clear, intentional, and well framed.\n\nThese four patterns give you a repeatable way to guide that conversation, whether you’re coding, reviewing, or planning.\n\nAs we head into the holidays, take a moment to save your favorite prompts, share them with your team, and start the new year with a stronger Copilot workflow.\n\nHappy holidays, happy Friday, and happy coding. See you in the next Cook’n with GitHub Copilot post!",
