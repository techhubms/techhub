Great teammates do not replace your judgment, they support it.\n\nThis week’s recipe is about knowing when to lead and when to delegate to GitHub Copilot so the work stays fast, thoughtful, and solid.\n\nProTip\n\n**Use GitHub Copilot as a collaborator, not an autopilot.**\n\nYou lead the thinking. GitHub Copilot helps with execution.\n\nWhen You Should Lead\n\nThere are moments where your experience matters most, and GitHub Copilot should follow your direction closely.\n\nYou should lead when:\n\n- Designing system architecture or data flow\n- Making tradeoffs around security, performance, or cost\n- Interpreting vague requirements or business rules\n- Reviewing logic that could impact users or production data\n\nIn these moments, GitHub Copilot works best when you give it context and constraints, not freedom.\n\n**Try this in GitHub Copilot Chat:**\n\n`I want to design this part myself. Ask me clarifying questions before suggesting any code.`\n\nThis keeps you in the driver’s seat while still getting help thinking things through.\n\nWhen It’s Smart to Delegate\n\nDelegation is where GitHub Copilot really shines.\n\nDelegate to Copilot when:\n\n- Writing boilerplate or repetitive patterns\n- Translating logic from one language or framework to another\n- Generating tests from existing code\n- Refactoring for readability or consistency\n- Adding logging, validation, or comments\n\nHere, speed matters more than invention.\n\n**Try this prompt:**\n\n`Take this existing code and refactor it for clarity and consistency. Do not change behavior.`\n\nYou stay responsible for the outcome, Copilot handles the busy work.\n\nThe Hand-Off Pattern That Works Best\n\nStrong teams work in loops, not one way commands. The same applies here.\n\nA simple rhythm that works well:\n\n1. You explain the goal.\n2. GitHub Copilot produces a first pass.\n3. You review and adjust.\n4. Copilot updates based on feedback.\n\n**Example follow up prompt:**\n\n`Good start. Now simplify this logic and explain any assumptions you made.`\n\nThis keeps momentum without giving up control.\n\nA Quick Rule of Thumb\n\n1. If the task requires judgment, you lead.\n\n2. If the task requires typing, delegate.\n\n3. GitHub Copilot is excellent at execution.\n\n4. You are still the owner of intent.\n\nQuick Takeaway\n\nThe best results come when you treat GitHub Copilot like a trusted teammate who waits for direction, checks its work, and helps you move faster. Lead when it counts. Delegate when it saves time. That balance is where things really click.",
