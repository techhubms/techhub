Other times, your own prompt might be vague or incomplete.\n\nThe Cognitive Verifier Pattern helps GitHub Copilot pause, clarify, and ask questions before diving into a solution.\n\nProTip\n\n**Let Copilot Ask Before It Acts**\n\nThink of this as giving Copilot permission to say, “Hold on, what exactly do you mean?”\n\nBy prompting it to generate clarifying questions, you train Copilot to think through the request like a thoughtful teammate instead of jumping straight to code.\n\nTry These Approaches\n\n**1️⃣ Ask Copilot to Verify Understanding**\n\n`Before answering, list 2–3 clarifying questions you would ask to make sure you fully understand my request.`\n\n*Best for:* Big or open ended tasks like “Build a dashboard” or “Add an integration.”\n\n**2️⃣ Combine with Reflection for Better Accuracy**\n\n`Before writing code, list questions that would help you understand potential edge cases or risks.`\n\n*Best for:* Complex logic or architectural changes.\n\n**3️⃣ Use It to Strengthen Requirements**\n\n`Generate a few clarifying questions a developer should ask before implementing this feature request.`\n\n*Best for:* Issue driven workflows, planning sessions, or backlog grooming.\n\n**4️⃣ Help Copilot Focus on the Right Context**\n\n`Before suggesting improvements, ask questions about the purpose of this function and its expected behavior.`\n\n*Best for:* Code reviews, refactors, or ambiguous legacy functions.\n\nQuick Tip\n\nSometimes the fastest path to a good answer is a short pause.\n\nLet Copilot question your prompt first, you will save time correcting assumptions later.\n\nQuick Takeaway\n\nThe Cognitive Verifier Pattern turns GitHub Copilot into a true collaborator that does not just code, it thinks with you.\n\nClarity before completion leads to cleaner, more accurate results.",
