Today’s recipe picks up right where that left off. Delegation is only half the job. Review is where real confidence is built.\n\nLet’s talk about how to review GitHub Copilot’s work the same way a senior developer would review a teammate’s pull request.\n\nProTip\n\n**Treat Copilot’s output like a first draft from a smart teammate.**\n\nReview it with intent, not suspicion.\n\nStart With Intent, Not Syntax\n\nBefore reading line by line, pause and ask one question.\n\n**What is this code trying to do?**\n\nSenior developers review for intent first, not formatting or style. If the purpose is unclear, everything else is noise.\n\n**Try this in GitHub Copilot Chat:**\n\n`Explain what this code is doing and what problem it solves.`\n\nIf the explanation doesn’t match your goal, stop there and correct course.\n\nValidate the Assumptions\n\nGitHub Copilot is fast, but it makes assumptions. Your job is to surface them.\n\nReview for:\n\n- Edge cases\n- Error handling\n- Default values\n- Hidden dependencies\n- Assumptions about input shape or state\n\n**Follow up prompt to use:**\n\n`What assumptions does this code make about inputs, state, or environment?`\n\nThis often reveals gaps you would otherwise miss.\n\nCheck Structure Before Details\n\nSenior reviewers look for structure early. Ask yourself:\n\n- Is responsibility clear?\n- Are functions doing one thing?\n- Is this easy to test?\n- Would another developer understand this in six months?\n\nIf not, let GitHub Copilot help clean it up.\n\n**Try this:**\n\n`Refactor this code to improve readability and structure without changing behavior.`\n\nThen review again.\n\n🔄 Use the Review Loop\n\nThe strongest workflow is a loop, not a handoff.\n\n1. GitHub Copilot generates code\n2. You review intent and structure\n3. You give targeted feedback\n4. GitHub Copilot revises\n5. You approve or adjust\n\nThis mirrors how experienced teams work every day.\n\nA Simple Senior Level Rule\n\nIf you would comment on it in a pull request, comment on it with Copilot.\n\nAsk for:\n\n- Clarification\n- Safer defaults\n- Simpler logic\n- Better naming\n\nGitHub Copilot responds well to direct, specific feedback.\n\nQuick Takeaway\n\nSenior developers don’t just write code. They review for clarity, safety, and long term understanding.\n\nWhen you review GitHub Copilot’s work with that same mindset, the output improves fast and so does your trust in it.",
