  "Description": "![Web View Refresh Banner](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2026/Reliably-Refreshing-the-WebView2-Control/WebViewRefreshBanner.jpg)\n\nIt seems like such a simple thing: Reloading Web Browser content when a page is already active. Just reload, right! But... it's never quite so simple. There is soft reload and hard reload, and it turns out the WebView2 control does not expose the underlying browser APIs in the same way you might be used to by your browser or DOM APIs. While there's `Reload()` functionality, there's no direct support for a hard reload that also reloads related resources like images, overriding local and server cache settings.\n\nSpecifically the WebView2 control has a `CoreWebView2.Reload()` method, but it lacks a `noCache` parameter to completely reload content of the page and all of its dependencies.\n\n[!\\[\\](/images/sponsors/banner-example.png?v=1.2)](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com?ut=weblog)\n\n## Why Hard Refreshes matter\n\nRefreshing content is a common thing that you do in any Web application, but in local desktop applications it's even more important, as many applications render content to local files, and then load those files into the WebView for display as previews or or other Html type views.\n\nFor example in [Markdown Monster](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com) and [Documentation Monster](https://documentationmonster.com) I render preview Html to file and then display the Html output in the browser.\n\nBut in these specific scenarios typical 'page' updates update the in memory DOM with changes for much faster updates, rather than full reloads from disk.\n\nHowever, there are a few scenarios that require a full reload of the page and all of its related resources. Specifically there are several operations that drop or paste images into the document and if an image has been changed I want to see the change immediately in the preview. By default `Reload()` will reload the page, but **won't refresh the images** so while I can force the refresh of the page content, if the image is already displayed, the changed image will not show up.\n\nHrmph! 😠\n\n## WebView2 Reload()\n\nSo the WebView has a `CoreWebView2.Reload()` method:\n\n```cs var url = WebView.Source?.ToString(); WebView.CoreWebView2.Reload()\n\n```\n\nIf you call `Reload()` like this you'll find that even the page content **sometimes still doesn't refresh** - even if content has been changed. This can happen due to target site's cache policy or the browser cache policy with local files or if local files are not properly updating their `LastWrite` timestamps. Mostly a reload works for content though...\n\n### Dependent Resource Refreshing\n\nBut much worse is that even if the content page itself refreshes with `Reload()` , dependent resources like images, scripts, style sheets etc. usually do not.\n\nThis can be really annoying if you're using the browser as a previewer. For example, in Markdown editing you might paste an image into the editor and it displays fine. Then you make a change to the underlying image, refresh the browser and... the image does not update which is an annoying fail!\n\n![MarkdownMonster Image Updates](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2026/Reliably-Refreshing-the-WebView2-Control/MarkdownMonster%20Image%20Updates.png)\n\n**Figure 1** - Markdown Monster images don't update if using only `CioreWebView2.Reload()` .\n\nThis happens even if the content page refreshes. Incidentally the same thing happens in a desktop browser, unless you hard refresh. And even then sometimes images do not refresh. But again, `Reload()` is not a hard refresh so by default support resources and in some cases even the main content do not refresh.\n\n## Hard Refresh in the WebView\n\n*So how do we do a real hard refresh in the WebView2 control?*\n\nLet's take a look...\n\n### Interactive Hard Reload with Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nT he WebView control is essentially a full Chromium instance so it has most of Chromium's native features. This means you can press `ctrl-shift-R` or `Ctrl-F5` to force a hard refresh in the browser - assuming you haven't overridden the key handling in some way in your host application.\n\nIt's an easy work around as long as your users are tech savy and do the key gymnastics or you've provided good documentation or visual clues to make the keyboard shortcuts accessible. But shortcuts are always difficult to bring attention to... it's just not very obvious. Obviously! 😂\n\n### Programmatic Hard Reload\n\nWhich brings us to programmatic solutions to Hard Refreshes that you can attach to commands or event handlers. Programmatic solutions are more explicit and... more obvious.\n\n#### Good - Replace the Url\n\nFor a simple way to force at least the content page to refresh reliably, you can replace the Url and force the page to reload explicitly:\n\n```csharp public void Refresh(bool noCache) { if (WebBrowser == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(WebBrowser.Source?.ToString())) return;\n\nif (noCache) { WebBrowser.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(async () => { // Hard Refresh code here var source = WebBrowser.Source?.ToString(); WebBrowser.Source = new Uri(\"about:blank\"); Dispatcher.Invoke(()=> WebBrowser.Source = new Uri(source));\n\n}).Task.FireAndForget();\n\nreturn; }\n\n// Potentially Cached Reload WebBrowser.CoreWebView2.Reload(); }\n\n```\n\nThe idea here is that you force the Url to be reset in the control. The Url has to be set to a different value first and then reset to properly log a change so it gets set to `about:blank` then back to the original Url.\n\n> >\n> Note that it appears resetting the `WebBrowser.Source`\n> is cycle dependent which is why I use a Dispatcher in the code above. In my use of this approach I started with two one-after-the-other `WebBrowser.Source`\n> assignments and that worked most of the time but failed occasionally and unreliably. Using the `Dispatcher`\n> improved the reliability but still occasionally fails to do a hard refresh.\n> >\n\nIn most situations I've found that this also reloads dependent resources, but I've had reports from a number of users that on occasion they see images not refreshing. Fairly rare though so this seems to corroborate my timing suspicion of the Source assignment.\n\nThere are more reliable `Reload()` solutions, but the reason you might want to use this solution is to avoid blowing out your entire profile cache entirely on a reload as the two following approaches do.\n\n#### Better - Simple Cache Revocation\n\nThe next approach uses the WebView's built in Profile cache APIs to clear the cache. The `ClearBrowsingDataAsync()` method can be used to clear all or select cache items from the active profile.\n\nThe code is simple enough:\n\n```csharp public void Refresh(bool noCache) { if (WebBrowser == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(WebBrowser.Source?.ToString())) return;\n\nif (noCache) { WebBrowser.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(async () => { // Hard Repload by clearing the Cache await WebBrowser.CoreWebView2.Profile.ClearBrowsingDataAsync(CoreWebView2BrowsingDataKinds.DiskCache); WebBrowser.CoreWebView2.Reload(); }).Task.FireAndForget(); return; }\n\nWebBrowser.CoreWebView2.Reload(); }\n\n```\n\nThe `ClearBrowsingDataAsync()` method can be called with no parameters which busts up all cached items, or you can specify which items to remove. For plain page display and related resources you typically only need the Disk Cache to be busted since related resources like images, scripts and style sheets are cached to disk in the WebView's Profile folder.\n\nNote that the `ClearBrowsingDataAsync()` method is async, and you have to `await` the method for the cache clearing to complete **before** you can `Reload()` the page.\n\nI'm using WPF here to go from sync to async using the `Dispatcher` , but you could make the entire method async and skip the Dispatcher to make this a little simpler. I'm doing that here because I have an older non-async interface I'm implementing and there's no need to explicitly make the external method async since navigation and reloading are inherently *not awaitable* in the WebView (you have to explicitly use events for that).\n\nThis method is the safest and most reliable way to ensure the browser and dependent resources are refreshed but there may still be some resources that are not refreshed.\n\n#### Best - Hard Cache Revoke like Browser Hard Refresh\n\nThis brings up to the last approach which is essentially what the WebBrowser users internally and is the closest thing to pressing `ctrl-shift-R` to force a hard reset.\n\nThis solution uses the WebView DevTools API to force a refresh:\n\n```csharp public void Refresh(bool noCache) { if (WebBrowser == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(WebBrowser.Source?.ToString())) return;\n\nif (noCache) { WebBrowser.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(async () => { // Hard Reload the Page await WebBrowser.CoreWebView2.CallDevToolsProtocolMethodAsync(\"Network.clearBrowserCache\", \"{}\"); WebBrowser.CoreWebView2.Reload(); }).Task.FireAndForget(); return; }\n\nWebBrowser.CoreWebView2.Reload(); // not working reliably if file initial navigate failed }\n\n```\n\nThe key here is the call to the [DevTools protocols](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Network/#method-clearBrowserCache):\n\n```cs await WebBrowser.CoreWebView2.CallDevToolsProtocolMethodAsync(\"Network.clearBrowserCache\", \"{}\");\n\n```\n\nThis `CallDevToolsProtocolMethodAsync()` API exposes a shit-ton of internal browser functionality via a command interface and `Networkd.clearBrowserCache` is one of the simplest ones.\n\nBut, there are some limitations to this API: it requires either a visual host running on an STA thread (which is every desktop UI app), or has to be used with a headless host explicitly in non-UI application contexts which is a lot more complicated. If you're in the latter category stick with the `ClearBrowsingDataAsync()` API instead as that has fewer limitations.\n\n### Also Useful For Navigation\n\nThe same approaches can also be used for Navigation instead of just for `Reload()` . You can run into the same cache issues with plain navigation, as resources like images may have been previously rendered in other pages, and if you then load another page with the same image that image may still be coming from cache.\n\nSo in my apps I typically also provide a Navigate method like this (use the Hard Refresh option of your choice):\n\n```csharp public void Navigate(string url, bool noCache) { if (noCache) { WebBrowser.Source = new Uri(\"about:blank\"); // force a refresh WebBrowser.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(async () => { await WebBrowser.CoreWebView2.CallDevToolsProtocolMethodAsync(\"Network.clearBrowserCache\", \"{}\"); WebBrowser.Source = new Uri(url); }).Task.FireAndForget(); } WebBrowser.Source = new Uri(url); }\n\n```\n\nYou can find these methods also as part of the [Westwind.WebView library](https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.WebView) and the `WebViewHandler` class which includes `Navigate()` and `Reload()` methods with various overloads.\n\n## Summary\n\nBrowser page reloads are common, but unfortunately the WebView2 doesn't make this functionality very straightforward **if you need to do a hard reload that refreshes the page and all of its dependencies**.\n\nLuckily there are relatively simple workarounds you can use:\n\n- Interact keyboard shortcuts\n- Replacing the URL explicitly\n\n*(use if you don't want to blow out your entire cache on `Reload())`*\n- Using `CoreWebView2.ClearBrowsingDataAsync()`\n\n*(for the most compatible cache busting approach)*\n- Using `CoreWebView2.CallDevToolsProtocolMethodAsync(\"Network.clearBrowserCache\")`\n\n*(for the most reliable hard cache refresh - but with some environment caveats)*\n\nAll are simple, but not so obvious solutions and you can choose for your specific scenario.\n\nIn my Preview Rendering apps I'm use the Dev Tools approach since I know the Desktop applications have access to the DevTools and because I want to make sure images get refreshed. Finally in my apps all resources are local, and relatively small so blowing the cache is not a problem.\n\nAs always I'm writing this down for future reference, since I'm sure I'll come looking for this information again. Maybe you will too...\n\n![](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/favicon.png) this post created and published with the [Markdown Monster Editor](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com)\n\n© Rick Strahl, West Wind Technologies, 2005-2026\n\nPosted in **[WebView](/ShowPosts.aspx?Category=WebView) [Windows](/ShowPosts.aspx?Category=Windows) [WPF](/ShowPosts.aspx?Category=WPF)**",
