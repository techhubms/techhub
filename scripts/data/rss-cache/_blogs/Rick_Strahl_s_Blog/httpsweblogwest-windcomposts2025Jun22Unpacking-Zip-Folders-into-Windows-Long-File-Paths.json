  "Description": "![Zip Archive Banner](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2025/Unpacking-Zip-Folders-into-Windows-Long-File-Paths/ZipArchiveBanner.jpg)\n\n[Long file paths on Windows are a pain in the ass](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jan/03/Integrating-Long-Path-Names-in-Windows-Applications)- we all know that. But today I ran into yet another issue with it that's worth mentioning: Namely that long file path syntax using the `\\\\?\\` prefix, which allows even non-supporting applications to use long paths, does not work with the .NET [ZipFiles class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.zipfile?view=net-9.0).\n\nSpecifically the following code does not work if you're unpacking a Zip file that creates files that exceed the 260 character MAX\\_PATH size limit:\n\n```csharp // THIS DOES NOT WORK outputFolder = @\"\\\\?\\\" + outputFolder; ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory(zipFile, outputFolder);\n\n```\n\nThe function complains about an invalid file path passed in.\n\n![Unzipping With Long Path Syntax Fails](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2025/Unpacking-Zip-Folders-into-Windows-Long-File-Paths/UnzippingWithLongPathSyntaxFails.png)\n\nWhat's even more disconcerting is that this fails with an exception **after it's already unpacked a bunch of files**. Oddly, it doesn't bomb right away when starting to unpack but it only goes awry once it hits files that exceed the MAX\\_PATH limit. The end result is terrible: It ends up with a half-baked result of a partially unpacked folder. If you use this function **make sure you trap any exceptions and clean up a partially unpacked folder** as part of your unzip routine.\n\nBottom line: The `\\\\?\\` Long Path syntax doesn't work with `ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory()` as I would have expected.\n\n[!\\[\\](/images/sponsors/banner-example.png?v=1.2)](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com?ut=weblog)\n\n## Quick Long File Paths Review\n\nBefore you get overeager and shout at me, *\"just enable Long Path support in your application\"*:\n\nYes, you can enable Long Paths in Windows and add a Manifest that enables application level long paths that make most things in .NET work automagically.\n\nIn fact I wrote an extensive blog post about a few years ago:\n\n- [Integrating Long Path Names in Windows Applications](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jan/03/Integrating-Long-Path-Names-in-Windows-Applications)\n\nThe short version of it is that Long Paths on Windows can be addressed in a couple of ways:\n\n- Enabling **both**Windows and the Application to support for Long Paths\n- System: Windows Registry or Group Policy setting\n- App: Application Manifest to enable Long Paths\n- Using special `\\\\?\\`\nfile syntax to indicate long paths\n\nOut of these two the global + app setting is the preferred mechanism **if you can manage to control the global setting**.\n\nUnfortunately, Windows does us no favors here, because for unfathomable reasons, by default Long Path support is disabled in Windows and... more importantly... in order to enable it requires a global, **administrative** setting. It can't be easily set from applications unless you elevate - and even if you could, it's not polite to assume you can/should do this. There's no per application setting for this.\n\nFor the most part this setting is not something that an application can have full control over and especially not a for small tool, like the tool I'm in the middle of building.\n\n## Enabling Long Path Support for an Application\n\nSo lets look at the two approaches in detail:\n\n- Windows Settings and Application Manifest\n- Using the `\\\\?\\`\nPath syntax without special requirements\n\n### Windows Settings and Application Manifest\n\nThe Registry hack is this:\n\n```text Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem] \"LongPathsEnabled\"=dword:00000001\n\n```\n\nThe Group Policy setting can be set at **Computer Configuration->Administrative Templates->System->Enable Win32 Long Paths** in the Local Group policy Editor:\n\n![Group Policy Editor](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2025/Unpacking-Zip-Folders-into-Windows-Long-File-Paths/GroupPolicyEditor.png)\n\n> >\n> ##### Awkward even with Tool Support\n> > >\n> In Markdown Monster [I have a documentation topic](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com/docs/FAQ/Using-Markdown-Monster-with-Long-Path-Names.html) that describes how to enable Long Path support along with a CLI helper that allows enabling and disabling long path support which is one way to handle it - but even so it's very intrusive.\n> >\n\nThe global setting isn't enough however, you also need the application to support it and you do this via an Application Manfest bound to the application:\n\n```xml\n\ntrue\n\n```\n\nand embedded into the project with:\n\n```xml\n\napp.manifest\n\n```\n\nAs you can see to make this works requires a few coordinated things that may or may not be easy to manage in your application.\n\n### `\\\\?\\`\nLong Path Syntax without Windows + App Support\n\nIf you want to do this generically without user intervention the above solution is not an option. If you're application and file access is simple enough you can do the 'one off' solution using the `\\\\?\\` Long Path syntax which allows you to prefix a fully qualified Windows path with the above:\n\n- Fully qualified path: `\\\\?\\c:\\temp\\tmpfiles\\dm_131233`\n- UNC Path: `\\\\?\\UNC\\share\\temp\\tmpfiles\\dm_131233`\n\nThis solution is not easy to manage in complex applications that have lots of file access to manage, but if you have a few places where files are accessed this can be the easiest and most non-obtrusive way to provide Long Path support.\n\n### With a little help from our Friends\n\nLong Paths only work with fully qualified or UNC paths - relative or root relative paths are not supported. So all paths need to be resolved before adding the appropriate `\\\\?\\` full path or UNC path syntax.\n\nTo make this easier and auto-resolve, I use a helper function for this in my [FileUtils Helper class](https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.Utilities/blob/019109be41f8e1eb268594a878d8dbd4c9e2decb/Westwind.Utilities/Utilities/FileUtils.cs#L240) in [West Wind Utilities](https://github.com/RickStrahl/Westwind.Utilities):\n\n```cs public static string GetWindowsLongFilename(string path) { if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(path)) return path;\n\nstring fullPath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(path);\n\nif (fullPath.Length 1 && fullPath[1] == ':') fullPath = @\"\\\\?\\\" + fullPath; // UNC Path else if (fullPath.Length > 2 && fullPath.StartsWith(@\"\\\\\")) fullPath = @\"\\\\?\\UNC\\\" + fullPath.Substring(2);\n\nreturn fullPath; }\n\n```\n\n## Replacing ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory()\n\nAlright so even with the long path syntax `ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory()` fails. Which means another approach is required.\n\nInstead of using the high level function to unpack in one go, it's actually quite easy to walk the archive and unpack it into a folder and explicitly add the long path fix ups for each file as it is unpacked.\n\n```csharp public bool ExtractZipFileToFolder(string zipFile, string outputFolder = null) { if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(outputFolder)) { SetError(\"Output folder is not specified.\"); return false; }\n\nZipFile.ExtractToDirectory(zipFile, outputFolder);\n\nzipFile = FileUtils.GetWindowsLongFilename(zipFile); using (var archive = ZipFile.OpenRead(zipFile)) { foreach (var entry in archive.Entries) { string targetPath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, entry.FullName); targetPath = targetPath.Replace('/', '\\\\'); // Ensure Windows path separators\n\ntargetPath = Path.GetFullPath(targetPath);\n\nvar fullPath = FileUtils.GetWindowsLongFilename(targetPath); if (entry.FullName.EndsWith(\"/\")) Directory.CreateDirectory(fullPath); else { Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(fullPath)); entry.ExtractToFile(fullPath, overwrite: true); } } }\n\nreturn true; }\n\n```\n\nAnd voila, that does the trick even if the global Long Path setting is not enabled. I get to unpack long filenames and directories generically! Yay!\n\n## Some Thoughts on Windows Pathing\n\nIdeally we should try to avoid long file paths on Windows, but the reality is that that's actually pretty hard to do when you need to write out files, because of the way Windows nests user profiles and the only place you can write files and especially temporary files is somewhere deep inside of the User Profile.\n\n> >\n> ##### Minimizing Paths is a Band-Aid not a Solution!\n> > >\n> Incidentally, I initially trimmed down some of the library paths which helped in my use case. However, that's only a partial solution given that users can create free-form topic titles of any length and can nest topics as deep as they like. At some point a limit would get hit no matter what I do to minimize.\n> > >\n> So trying to limit paths is often a fool's errant, unless you tightly control the file structure, which is difficult to do especially in applications that generically use files (like an editor like Markdown Monster for example).\n> >\n\nA typical temp path starts out deeply nested before ever even getting into adding your own folder structure.\n\n``` c:\\users\\MyUserName\\Temp\\tmpfiles\\\n\n```\n\nYou're 35 characters in with this and god forbid you have a long ass username!\n\nIn my specific scenario I'm running a utility that unpacks a potentially deeply nested documentation hierarchy to disk and it starts failing at some of the Javascript library dependencies which are deeply nested (ie. common NPM structures). And it needs to go into a location that has Write access which means it has to go somewhere in the user profile. It gets worse if you go into `%appdata%` or `%localappdata%` which have even longer base paths.\n\nHeck I even use a custom temp folder that's not quite as deeply nested and still ran into 260 character limit.\n\nBy using the `\\\\?\\` path syntax however I was able to write out the files and it worked.\n\nPutting this all together in my Web site packing tool which unpacks an Exe file that contains the base binary plus an embedded Zip file of the web site, it looks something like this:\n\n```csharp // Called from app startup to unpack the package // before running the local Web site public bool UnpackageFile(string packageFilename, string outputPath = null, bool unZip = true, bool noDirectoryCheck = false) { if (!File.Exists(packageFilename)) { SetError(\"Package file does not exist.\"); return false; }\n\nif (Directory.Exists(outputPath)) { SetError(\"Output path exists already. Make sure you use a unique folder name or clear the folder to avoid overwriting files.\"); return false; }\n\nDirectory.CreateDirectory(outputPath);\n\n// find the separator that separates the EXE and Zip parts var offset = FindMarkerOffset(packageFilename, SeparatorBytes); if (offset ```\n\nYou should also be aware that just because your application can write out the files, it doesn't mean that other applications that are not Long Path aware can read the data! Make sure you know what the files will be used for or you may not be able to actually access them in the way you think if you're dealing with a non-Long Path aware application.\n\nLuckily my use case is for a self-contained Html Web site viewer that points at a folder and the viewer and packager/unpackager are the same application that is Long Path enabled. Apparently the WebView2 control and Chromium also supports some level of Long Path support because the expanded site is running perfectly from the target location!\n\n## Summary\n\nIt's really sad that we're still having to talk about this `MAX_PATH` crap today. The fact that Windows does not have Long Path support enabled by default seems almost criminal given the deep nesting of base user folders to begin wtih. Even if there are backwards compatibility issues, Long Paths should be opt out, not opt in. The feature is there damn it, enable it by default!\n\nI've been running with Long Path support enabled for years and I have yet to see a problem. I'm sure some old DOS and classic Win32 applications might have issues, but do we really need to keep Windows hostage for those?\n\nThe good news is in some cases you can work around the limitations even generically if the problem space is simple enough as is the case in the Utility I'm working on at the moment. Using the `\\\\?\\` work around with individual files might apply to other tools as well as a generic workaround that works without having to tweak Windows with Administrative rights in order to Extract a Zip file to a folder.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [ZipFile class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.zipfile?view=net-9.0)\n- [Integrating Long Path Names in Windows Applications](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jan/03/Integrating-Long-Path-Names-in-Windows-Applications)\n\n© Rick Strahl, West Wind Technologies, 2005-2025\n\nPosted in **[.NET](/ShowPosts.aspx?Category=.NET) [Windows](/ShowPosts.aspx?Category=Windows)**",

Using the `\\\\?\\` work around with individual files might apply to other tools as well as a generic workaround that works without having to tweak Windows with Administrative rights in order to Extract a Zip file to a folder.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [ZipFile class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.zipfile?view=net-9.0)\n- [Integrating Long Path Names in Windows Applications](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jan/03/Integrating-Long-Path-Names-in-Windows-Applications)\n\n### Other Posts you might also like\n\n- [Adding minimal OWIN Identity Authentication to an Existing ASP.NET MVC Application](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2015/Apr/29/Adding-minimal-OWIN-Identity-Authentication-to-an-Existing-ASPNET-MVC-Application)\n- [Keeping Content Out of the Publish Folder for WebDeploy](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Aug/24/Keeping-Content-Out-of-the-Publish-Folder-for-WebDeploy)\n- [Using SQL Server on Windows ARM](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Oct/24/Using-Sql-Server-on-Windows-ARM)\n- [Map Physical Paths with an HttpContext.MapPath() Extension Method in ASP.NET](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2023/Aug/15/Map-Physical-Paths-with-an-HttpContextMapPath-Extension-Method-in-ASPNET)\n\nShare on:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2025/Jun/22/Unpacking-Zip-Folders-into-Windows-Long-File-Paths&amp;text=Unpacking%20Zip%20Folders%20into%20Windows%20Long%20File%20Paths&amp;via=RickStrahl\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2025/Jun/22/Unpacking-Zip-Folders-into-Windows-Long-File-Paths&amp;t=Unpacking%20Zip%20Folders%20into%20Windows%20Long%20File%20Paths http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2025/Jun/22/Unpacking-Zip-Folders-into-Windows-Long-File-Paths&amp;title=Unpacking%20Zip%20Folders%20into%20Windows%20Long%20File%20Paths\n\n![Make Donation](/images/donation.png \"Find this content useful?
