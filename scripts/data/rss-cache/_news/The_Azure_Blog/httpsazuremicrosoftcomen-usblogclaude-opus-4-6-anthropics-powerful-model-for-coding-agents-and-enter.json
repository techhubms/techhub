We’ve been testing Claude models in Microsoft Foundry and are excited about the direction of Anthropic’s model roadmap. Foundry gives us a flexible, enterprise-ready environment to explore frontier models while maintaining the trust, governance, and scale that are critical for Adobe.\n> >\n> —Michael Marth, VP Engineering for Experience Manager and LLM Optimizer, Adobe\n\n## Introducing Opus 4.6: Frontier intelligence, built for real work\n\nClaude Opus 4.6 is the latest version of Anthropic’s most intelligent model, and is considered the best Opus model for coding, enterprise agents, and professional work. With a 1M token context window (beta) and 128K max output, Opus 4.6 is ideal for:\n\n- Production code\n- Sophisticated agents\n- Office tasks\n- Financial analysis\n- Cybersecurity\n- Computer use\n\nBy combining Anthropic’s most advanced model with [Foundry’s end-to-end tooling](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/), customers can move from experimentation to production faster, without stitching together infrastructure.\n\n### 1. Autonomous coding at a new level\n\nOpus 4.6 handles large codebases well and is particularly effective at long-running tasks like refactoring, bug detection, and complex implementations.\n\nThis allows senior engineers to delegate work that previously took days, covering everything from requirements gathering to implementation and maintenance, while staying focused on reviews and decision-making.\n\nWith Foundry’s managed infrastructure and operational controls, teams can compress development timelines from days into hours, while maintaining the rigor required for real-world production systems.\n\n> >\n> *Macroscope has relied on Anthropic’s frontier models to push what’s possible in AI code review, helping us catch the bugs that matter most to customers before they ever reach production. We’re incredibly excited to deepen this partnership by scaling on Azure infrastructure and delivering our product to teams around the world.*\n> >\n> —Kayvon Beykpour, CEO & Co-Founder, Macroscope\n\n### 2. Better knowledge work across the enterprise\n\nOpus 4.6 delivers a step-change in how enterprises approach knowledge work, which Anthropic defines across three pillars: **search, analyze, and create**. In Microsoft Foundry, these capabilities can be applied directly to enterprise data, workflows, and agent-driven applications.\n\nOpus 4.6 understands the conventions and norms of professional domains, producing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations that look and read like expert-created work. Combined with Foundry’s governance and access controls, this makes Opus 4.6 a great fit for finance, legal, and [other precision-critical industries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/healthcare/2026/01/11/bridging-the-gap-between-ai-and-medicine-claude-in-microsoft-foundry-advances-capabilities-for-healthcare-and-life-sciences-customers/) where quality, context, and compliance matter.\n\n> >\n> *At Dentons, we are scaling generative AI across drafting, review, and research workflows across our global teams. Claude in Microsoft Foundry brings the frontier reasoning strength we need for legal work, backed by the governance and operational controls required in an enterprise environment. Better model reasoning reduces rework and improves consistency, so our lawyers can focus on higher value judgment.*\n> >\n> —Matej Jambrich, CTO, Dentons Europe\n\n## High context financial analysis\n\nOpus 4.6 excels at connecting insights across regulatory filings, market reports, and internal enterprise data, surfacing conclusions that would traditionally take analysts days to compile.\n\nIts advanced reasoning capabilities allow it to:\n\n- Navigate nuanced financial and regulatory contexts\n- Generate compliance-sensitive outputs\n- Maintain consistency and traceability across complex analytical workflows\n\nWhen deployed through Microsoft Foundry, these workflows benefit from Azure’s security, compliance, and auditability, helping organizations apply frontier AI to high-stakes analysis with confidence.\n\n### 3. Advancing agentic and computer use capabilities\n\nAccording to Anthropic, Opus 4.6 delivers major gains in computer use, with strong performance on industry benchmarks for visual understanding and multi-step navigation. Opus 4.6 sets a new standard for computer use. Claude can now operate computers more accurately, handle more complex tasks, and work across multiple applications seamlessly.\n\nIt can interact with software, navigate interfaces, complete forms, and move data across applications. When deployed in [Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/), these actions can run as **secure, governed agents**, enabling automation of workflows that span legacy systems, document processing, and operational tools.\n\nOpus 4.6 can manage complex, multi-tool workflows with less oversight—an essential requirement for teams operating AI systems at scale.\n\n> >\n> Anthropic on Azure provides Momentic with the reliability guarantees needed to process millions of tokens per hour on state-of-the-art models like Opus 4.5.
