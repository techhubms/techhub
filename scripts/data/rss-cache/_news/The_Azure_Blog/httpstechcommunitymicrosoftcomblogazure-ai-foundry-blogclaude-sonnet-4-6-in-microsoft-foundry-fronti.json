If Opus represents the highest tier of AI performance, Sonnet 4.6 builds on that momentum by delivering nearly Opus-level intelligence at a lower price, while often being more token efficient than Claude Sonnet 4.5.\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6 is available today in Microsoft Foundry, and it is designed for teams who want frontier performance across coding, agents, and professional work at scale. With Sonnet 4.6, customers get access to powerful reasoning and productivity capabilities that make everyday AI a practical reality for development teams, enterprise knowledge workers, and automation scenarios.\n\n**Large Context, Adaptive Thinking, and Effort Controls**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6 delivers frontier intelligence at scale, built for coding, agents, and enterprise workflows.\n\nA major highlight is its 1 million token context window (beta), matching the extended context capabilities of Claude Opus 4.6, alongside 128K maximum output. This enables teams to work across massive codebases, long financial models, multi-document analysis, and extended multi-turn workflows without fragmentation or repeated context resets.\n\nSonnet 4.6 also uses adaptive thinking and effort parameters, that gives Claude the freedom to think if and when it determines reasoning is required.  This is an evolution from traditional extended thinking, optimizing both performance and speed. Teams can use effort parameters to better control quality-latency-cost tradeoffs.\n\n**A Developer’s Everyday Model**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6 is a full upgrade for software development. It is smart enough to work independently through complex codebases and handles iterative workflows without losing quality.\n\nEnterprise software teams can expect Claude Sonnet 4.6 to deliver:\n\n- Stronger reasoning across code contexts\n- Better understanding of complex codebases\n- Reliable performance across iterative development cycles\n\nWhether you’re building features, refactoring existing modules, or debugging tricky issues, Sonnet 4.6 can follow your workflow, maintain architectural context, and adapt as you iterate.\n\nSonnet 4.6 is designed for back-and-forth development:\n\n- You define intent\n- It produces high-quality outputs\n- You guide refinement\n- Deliverables stay consistent through iterations\n\nFor teams building in Microsoft Foundry, this translates to fewer context resets, faster cycle times, and smoother development velocity.\n\n``` Ref:  Benchmark table published by Anthropic ```\n\n**Empowering High-Quality Knowledge Work**\n\nSonnet 4.6 makes high-quality knowledge work accessible at scale, enabling teams to produce polished outputs with fewer editing cycles.\n\nImprovements in search, analysis, and content generation make Sonnet 4.6 ideal for everyday enterprise workflows, such as:\n\n- Drafting and refining reports\n- Summarizing large document sets\n- Generating structured business documentation\n- Producing polished presentations and narratives\n\nConsistent quality across both single-turn tasks and extended multi-turn collaboration ensures teams spend less time refining and more time delivering.\n\n**Powerful Computer Use**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6 is Anthropic’s most capable computer use model yet, scoring 72.5% on OSWorld Verified. With improved precision, the model has better clicking accuracy on difficult UI elements.  Claude Sonnet 4.6 enables browser automation at scale without API key dependency. It can navigate, interact, and complete tasks across any browser-based surface, including tools with no API, legacy systems, and sites you’re already logged into.\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6 can work across apps without explicit instruction. It can read context from one surface and act on another, checking a calendar, responding to a message, and creating an event, without the user having to orchestrate each step.\n\nFor organizations running business workflows on systems that predate modern APIs, Sonnet 4.6’s browser-based computer use is transformative. For developers, Sonnet 4.6 is a strong fit for software development workflows as a QA and testing layer. Spinning up a browser when needed, developers can delegate visual inspection and form-based validation.\n\n**Versatile Horizontal and Vertical Use Cases**\n\nClaude Sonnet 4.6 is a direct upgrade to Sonnet 4.5. Most workflows will require only minimal prompting changes.,\n\n**1. Search & Conversational Experiences**\n\nSonnet 4.6 is an excellent choice for high-volume conversational products, delivering consistent quality across multi-turn exchanges while remaining cost-efficient for scale.\n\n**2. Agentic & Multi-Model Pipelines**\n\nSonnet 4.6 can function as both lead agent and sub-agent in multi-model setups. Adaptive thinking, context compaction, and effort controls give developers precise orchestration tools for complex workflows.\n\n**3. Finance & Analytics**\n\nWith stronger financial modeling intelligence and improved spreadsheet capabilities, Sonnet 4.6  is a strong fit for analysis, compliance review, and data summarization workflows where precision and iteration speed matter.\n\n**4.** **Enterprise Document & Workflow Production**\n\nUsers need fewer rounds of editing to reach production-ready documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, making Claude Sonnet 4.6 a strong fit for finance, legal, and other precision-critical verticals where polish and domain accuracy matter.\n\n**Built for Scale in Microsoft Foundry**\n\nWith Claude Sonnet 4.6 available in Microsoft Foundry, customers can deploy near-Opus-level intelligence within an enterprise-grade environment that supports governance, compliance, and operational tooling.\n\nFor teams building modern AI workflows, from developer assistants to enterprise automation agents, Claude Sonnet 4.6 provides a powerful, scalable foundation in Microsoft Foundry.\n\nTry it today &lt;[claude-sonnet-4-6 - Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/claude-sonnet-4-6/version/1/registry/azureml-anthropic?tid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)&gt;\n\nAnd to go deeper, join us on [**February 23 for Model Mondays**](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26811/), where leaders from Anthropic will walk through both Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Sonnet 4.6 including real-world use cases, architectural guidance, and what’s next for frontier models in enterprise deployment.\n\nUpdated Feb 17, 2026\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n[!\\[amar_badal&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xNTAzMjEzLTUzMTg2NGk4MzFEQzdENDE2QzEwNUZE?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/amar_badal/1503213) [amar_badal](/users/amar_badal/1503213) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined August 30, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/amar_badal/1503213)\n\n/category/azure-ai-foundry/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog [Microsoft Foundry Blog](/category/azure-ai-foundry/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity"
