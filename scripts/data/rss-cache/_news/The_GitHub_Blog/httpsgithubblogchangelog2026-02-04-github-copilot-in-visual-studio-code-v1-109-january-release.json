  "EnhancedContent": "This January 2026 release brings significant improvements to GitHub Copilot in [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/VSCode/109) with agent-driven workflows, improvements to agent session management, and the introduction of agent support for Claude by Anthropic – right in your IDE.\n\n### Agent extensibility (models + integrations)\n\n- Claude agent support is in public preview and enables delegating tasks to Anthropic’s official Claude Agent SDK using Claude models from your GitHub Copilot subscription.\n- Richer chat interactions with MCP apps enable more tool-driven, interactive Copilot experiences inside VS Code.\n\n### Copilot Chat & UX\n\n- Faster, snappier chat experience with improved streaming responsiveness.\n- Higher-quality reasoning results for more reliable answers and better task execution.\n- Better visibility into model reasoning with thinking tokens and agents that ask questions instead of assuming.\n- Revamped editor inline chat to make in-context Copilot interactions feel more natural and effective while you code.\n\n### Multiagent development & session management\n\n- Improved agent session management makes it easier to delegate work across:\n- Copilot\n- Claude\n- Local agents\n- Background agents\n- Cloud agents\n- Seamless handoff and intervention: jump into agent work when needed, without disrupting momentum.\n- Agent status indicator shows sessions needing attention, subagents run in parallel for faster completion.\n\n### Copilot agent customization\n\n- Agent orchestrations enable building repeatable workflows tailored to your team or project.\n- Agent Skills plus org-wide customization help ensure more consistent outcomes across developers and environments.\n\n### Agent optimizations (smarter + faster)\n\n- Copilot Memory helps agents work smarter by retaining relevant context across interactions.\n- Faster code search via external indexing improves retrieval speed and responsiveness during large-repo development.\n\n### Agent security & trust\n\n- Terminal command sandboxing increases confidence when agents propose or execute commands (experimental, macOS/Linux only) .\n- Effective auto-approval rules improve safety and control for agent-driven actions while reducing unnecessary prompts.\n- Terminal lifecycle improvements give better control over background commands with timeout, await, and kill capabilities.\n\n### Related VS Code productivity updates (not Copilot-related)\n\n- **Integrated browser**: Test and run apps without leaving the editor.\n- **Terminal enhancements**: Quality-of-life improvements for smoother, more reliable terminal usage.\n- **Coding & editor improvements**: Multiple refinements to everyday coding flow.\n- **Extensions & API updates**: New capabilities for extension authors to build richer experiences.\n\nHappy coding!\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
