These options join Anthropic, Microsoft Foundry, OpenAI, and xAI as supported BYOK choices.\n\n**Support for the Responses API**\n\nBYOK now supports models that use the Responses API. This enables structured outputs and richer multimodal interactions.\n\n**Ability to set a maximum context window**\n\nAdmins can define the maximum context window for BYOK models, helping balance cost, performance, and response quality.\n\n**Streaming responses for faster interaction**\n\nStreaming output from connected models lets Copilot display responses as they are generated, rather than waiting for completion.\n\n### Start using the new BYOK features today\n\nThese new capabilities are available now in public preview for GitHub Enterprise and Business customers. Connect your LLM provider’s API key in your enterprise or organization settings and start using your models in Copilot Chat and supported IDEs. Learn more by visiting [our BYOK documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/use-your-own-api-keys).\n\n### Help us shape the future\n\nWe are just getting started and your feedback will guide what comes next.
