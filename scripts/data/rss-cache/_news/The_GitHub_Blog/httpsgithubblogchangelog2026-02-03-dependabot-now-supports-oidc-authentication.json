Short-lived, dynamically generated tokens reduce operational overhead and attack surface.\n- **Simpler management:** Enables secure, policy-compliant access to private registries.\n- **Avoid rate limiting:** Dynamic credentials help you avoid hitting rate limits associated with static tokens.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo enable OIDC authentication for your private registry, update your `dependabot.yml` configuration to use the new OIDC authentication type for supported registries. See our [documentation on private registry configuration](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot) for setup instructions and examples.\n\n## Learn more\n\n- [Configuring access to private registries for Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/configuring-access-to-private-registries-for-dependabot)\n- [About OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)",
