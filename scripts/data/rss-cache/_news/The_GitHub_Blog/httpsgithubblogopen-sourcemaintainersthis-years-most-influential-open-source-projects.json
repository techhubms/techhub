OSPSB, an initiative from the OpenSSF community, gives maintainers a practical, no-nonsense checklist of what “good security” actually looks like. Instead of vague best practices, it focuses on realistic, minimum requirements that any project can meet, no matter the size of the team.\n\nAt Universe 2025, OSPSB resonated with maintainers looking for clarity in a world of shifting threats. The maturity levels and self-assessment tools make it simple to understand where your project is strong, where it needs improvement, and how users can contribute back to security work — a win for the entire ecosystem.\n\n**💡 Fun fact:** OSPSB is used by hundreds of projects as a self-assessment tool, and it’s supported by the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund to help maintainers keep their software resilient.\n\n> >\n> The resilience and sustainability of open source is a shared responsibility between maintainers and users. Beyond telling consumers why they should trust your project, Baseline will also tell them where they can contribute to security improvements.\n> >\n> Xavier René-Corail, Senior Director, GitHub Security Research\n\n### p5.js and Processing for Creative Coding\n\n[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a beginner-friendly JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, educators, and developers alike.
