You can learn more at [OpenCode’s site](https://opencode.ai/).\n\n## How it works\n\nGetting started with OpenCode and GitHub Copilot is simple:\n\n- In OpenCode, run `/connect`\nand select **GitHub Copilot**.\n- Complete the GitHub device login flow.\n- Start using OpenCode powered by Copilot.\n\n## Who can use this feature\n\nAll developers with paid GitHub Copilot subscriptions (Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise) can now authenticate into OpenCode using their Copilot credentials—no additional AI license needed.\n\nLearn more about [OpenCode’s Copilot provider setup](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/#github-copilot-support).\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
