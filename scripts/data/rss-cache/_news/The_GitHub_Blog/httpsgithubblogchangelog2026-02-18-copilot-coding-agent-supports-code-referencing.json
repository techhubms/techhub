When the policy is set to `Block` , suggestions matching public code will not be blocked, and instead will be highlighted in the session logs.\n\nFor more information, see [“Finding public code that matches GitHub Copilot suggestions” in the GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/get-code-suggestions/find-matching-code?tool=webui#view-code-references-for-copilot-coding-agent).",
