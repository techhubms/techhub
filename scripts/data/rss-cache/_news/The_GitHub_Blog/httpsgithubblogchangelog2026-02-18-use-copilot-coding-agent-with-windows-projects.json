Delegate a task to Copilot, and Copilot works in the background in its own development environment, powered by GitHub Actions.\n\nBy default, the agent use a Linux development environment. If your project targets Windows, you can now configure Copilot coding agent to use a Windows environment, still powered by GitHub Actions.\n\nWith a working development environment, Copilot can ensure your project builds and your automated tests and linter pass, so you get a green pull request on the first try.\n\nYou can configure Copilot coding agent to use Windows by creating a `copilot-setup-steps.yml` file in your repository with a custom `runs-on` setting.\n\nCopilot coding agent’s [integrated firewall](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-firewall) is not compatible with Windows, so we recommended that you only use Windows with self-hosted runners or larger runners with Azure private networking where you can implement your own network controls.\n\nTo learn more about switching Copilot coding agent to a Windows development environment, see [“Customizing the development environment for Copilot coding agent”](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment#switching-copilot-to-a-windows-development-environment) in the GitHub Docs.",
