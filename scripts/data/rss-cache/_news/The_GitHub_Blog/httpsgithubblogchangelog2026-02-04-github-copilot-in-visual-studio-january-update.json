Check the Insiders channel for the latest:\n\n- **Colorized code completions**: Code completions now feature syntax highlighting to help you quickly distinguish variables, functions, and other elements. Enable this in settings by selecting **Use colorized text for code completions**.\n- **Click to partially accept code completions**: Accept only part of a suggestion by clicking directly inside it. Hover over the suggestion to see each segment highlighted, and accept up to the cursor position.\n- **Productivity improvements**: A series of highly requested improvements let you better control and customize your editor with faster scrolling, HTML-rich copy paste, syntactic line compression, and more.\n- **Streamlined Markdown preview controls**: Switch between **Split Preview**, **Open Preview**, and **Edit Markdown** modes for more flexibility. Zoom controls help with Mermaid diagrams, and Copilot Chat now includes a **Preview** button to render and edit generated markdown content directly. This is now available in the Stable channel.\n\n[Download Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) to experience all the new Copilot features today.
