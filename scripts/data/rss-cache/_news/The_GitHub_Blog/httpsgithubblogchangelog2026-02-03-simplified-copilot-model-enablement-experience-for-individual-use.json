  "EnhancedContent": "We’ve made it easier to discover and use the latest models across all Copilot features. If you’re a Copilot Pro+, Pro, or Free user, newly released models are now available directly within Copilot—no need to manage policies or visit your settings pages to access them.\n\nWith this change:\n\n- New models are immediately accessible within Copilot features—no extra clicks or visits to settings required.\n- You can use a model by choosing it yourself or by letting GitHub pick one for you when Auto mode is on.\n- Models work immediately once selected.\n\nThis update reduces friction and removes ambiguity around model availability, all while preserving your ability to decide which models you use and when. All existing data-usage policies remain unchanged and continue to apply. Note, this is rolling out over the next day. If you don’t see it yet, please check back soon.
