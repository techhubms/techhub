  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Enterprise administrators can now use GitHub Apps with the **enterprise teams** fine-grained permissions to access Enterprise Teams API endpoints. Previously, these endpoints required a personal access token (classic), but this update provides a more secure approach for enterprise team management.\n\nThe new `enterprise teams` fine-grained permission offers both `read` and `write` access levels to an enterprise-level Github App. These new fine-grained permissions allow create, update, and delete operations enabling Enterprise administrators to securely manage their teams at scale with programmatic app integrations.\n\nTo learn more, read about [GitHub Apps authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/about-authentication-with-a-github-app) or [Enterprise Teams API endpoints](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/enterprise-teams?apiVersion=2022-11-28).
