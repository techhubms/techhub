  "EnhancedContent": "Dependabot now supports grouping updates by dependency name across multiple directories, making it easier to manage dependency upgrades in repositories with more than one package or service.\n\n### What’s changed\n\nPreviously, Dependabot generated a separate pull request for each directory where a dependency needed updating. If your repository contained multiple directories, this meant several pull requests for a single dependency bump. For example, upgrading `requests` across three directories would produce three individual pull requests:\n\n- `chore(deps): bump requests in /service-a`\n- `chore(deps): bump requests in /service-b`\n- `chore(deps): bump requests in /service-c`\n\nWith this release, you can configure Dependabot to consolidate updates for the same dependency into a single pull request, regardless of how many directories are affected. This’ll help reduce the number of pull requests and simplify your upgrade workflow. **This configuration is especially valuable for monorepos where a single dependency bump can touch dozens of directories**.\n\n### Who can use this feature\n\nThis feature is available for all github.com users and will ship in GHES 3.21.\n\n### Get started\n\nConfigure your directory groups in the `dependabot.yml` file in your repository. The [Dependabot configuration docs](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#groups) can help you get started.\n\nJoin the discussion within the [Dependabot Community](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/13284).",
