  "EnhancedContent": "You can now use GitHub Copilot to generate titles for your pull requests (PRs) on github.com.\n\n### How it works\n\nWhen you open a new PR or edit an existing PR title, you’ll see a **GitHub Copilot** button in the PR title field. Select this button to have GitHub Copilot suggest a concise, descriptive title based on the commit messages in your PR.\n\n### Try it out\n\n1. Open a pull request on github.com.\n2. In the title field, select the GitHub Copilot button.\n3. Review the suggested title and apply or edit it as needed.\n\n### Tips for better results\n\nBecause GitHub Copilot generates titles from your commit messages, the quality of the suggestions depends on how you write those messages.\n\nFor best results:\n\n- Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what changed.\n- Avoid placeholder commit messages like `WIP`\nor `fix` without context.\n- Group related changes into a single PR so the suggested title reflects a single theme.\n\nIf your commit messages are vague or repetitive, GitHub Copilot may generate less useful titles.\n\n### Learn more and share feedback\n\nThis feature is generally available on github.com for PRs that include one or more commits.\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/187249).",
