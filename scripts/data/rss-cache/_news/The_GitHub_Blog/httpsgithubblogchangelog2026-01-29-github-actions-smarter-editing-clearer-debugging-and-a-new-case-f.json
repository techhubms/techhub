  "EnhancedContent": "We’ve shipped several improvements to GitHub Actions that make it easier to write, validate, and troubleshoot workflow logic, especially when you rely on `if:` conditionals to control what runs.\n\nHere are some of the new improvements:\n\n- A **new `case` function** for more expressive conditional logic\n- Expanded expression logs so you can **see why jobs get skipped**.\n- Better workflow authoring across VS Code, web editor, and other IDEs\n- Editor support for `action.yml`\nfiles\n- Better `if:`\ncondition handling\n\n### Write more expressive expressions with a `case`\nfunction\n\nGitHub Actions expressions now support a `case` function which can perform true logical operations, similar to a `case` expression in SQL. This lets you handle many different types of logical operations including `if-else` , `if-else if` , `if-else if-else` and even `switch-case` . This function also uses booleans so it avoids the limitations of [current workarounds](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/409). You can find more information about the `case` function in the [expressions documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/expressions#case).\n\n### Understand why jobs get skipped\n\nWhen a job is skipped because of an `if:` conditional, you can now see exactly why. The job logs show the original expression alongside an expanded version with all values from contexts at runtime. You can find details on how to access these logs in the [job condition logs documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions/how-tos/monitor-workflows/view-job-condition-logs).\n\n### Better workflow authoring across editors\n\nWe’ve brought the enhanced workflow authoring experience from the GitHub Actions VS Code extension to the web editor and other IDEs. Improvements include:\n\n- **Smarter autocomplete:** Context-aware completions for expressions, event payloads, `needs`\noutputs, and `matrix` values.\n- **Expression validation:** Catches invalid context access, unrecognized functions, and literal text in `if`\nconditions.\n- **Hover documentation:** View function signatures and context descriptions inline.\n- **Standalone binary:** Use the language service in NeoVim, Emacs, Sublime, or other editors.\n- Plus inline cron schedule hints, smarter syntax completions, and more.\n\n### Editor support for `action.yml`\nfiles\n\nAction authors now get the same editing experience as workflow authors. When you open an `action.yml` file in VS Code, the web editor, or any editor using the standalone binary, you’ll get:\n\n- **Autocomplete** for action metadata fields (`name`\n, `description` , `inputs` , `outputs` , `runs` , etc.).\n- **Context-aware `runs` completions** that filter based on your action type (Node.js, composite, or Docker).\n- **Validation** for schema compliance, required fields, and expressions.\n- **Scaffolding snippets** to quickly bootstrap new actions.\n\n### Better `if:`\ncondition handling\n\nWe’ve added improvements to catch common pitfalls with `if:` conditions and other workflow fields. Specifically:\n\n- `if`\nconditions with text outside the `${{ }}` markers, which makes the whole expression a string (always truthy). This will be caught by editor validation in VS Code and the web editor, and produces an annotation on the workflow run.\n- Invalid `format`\nstrings. This will also be caught by the editor validation.\n- Trailing newlines will automatically be trimmed.\n\n#### What this means in practice\n\n- Fewer surprise jobs and steps from always-truthy strings.\n- Earlier feedback on malformed conditions.\n\nFrom authoring to debugging, your workflow experience just got smoother.\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
