With this new feature you can expand the diff to reveal unchanged code and leave a comment or suggested change wherever it’s needed!\n\nComments added on unchanged lines on github.com are also displayed in GitHub Mobile, so you can review and respond from your phone without missing context.\n\nThis makes it easier to flag changes that should have been made, suggest updates beyond the diff context, and add helpful context for reviewers on unchanged parts of a file.\n\nThe new experience is now available on the latest production build of GitHub Mobile on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android).\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
