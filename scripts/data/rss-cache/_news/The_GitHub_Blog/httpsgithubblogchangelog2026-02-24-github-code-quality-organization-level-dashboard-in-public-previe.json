It gives organization owners, administrators, and developers a view of code health across repositories where code quality is enabled.\n\n![Screenshot of a GitHub organization&rsquo;s \"Security\" section with \"Code quality\" selected in the left sidebar. The main panel shows the Code quality dashboard with a \"Score distribution across repositories\" bubble chart plotting maintainability (y-axis) versus reliability (x-axis).](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22861199-0d9e-44d7-ac7a-c776ed3ade34)\n\nTo view the dashboard, go to the “Code quality” section under the organization-level **Security** tab. You can quickly assess code health across your organization, compare metrics across repositories, and identify which repositories need attention. You can also sort and filter repositories by reliability, maintainability, and other quality attributes.\n\nThe dashboard respects repository permissions:\n\n- Organization owners and administrators can view information for all repositories.\n- Developers can view information for repositories where they have `write`\naccess.\n\nThis dashboard is available to organizations participating in the GitHub Code Quality public preview on github.com, as well as on [GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/data-residency/about-github-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency). Learn more in the [GitHub Code Quality documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-quality).\n\nJoin the discussion and share feedback in the [GitHub Code Quality announcement](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/177488).",
