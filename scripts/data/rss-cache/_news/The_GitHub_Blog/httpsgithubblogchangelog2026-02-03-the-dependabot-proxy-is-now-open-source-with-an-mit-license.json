The proxy is built in Go and supports npm, Maven, Docker, Cargo, Helm, NuGet, pip, RubyGems, and Terraform, along with Git servers like GitHub, Azure DevOps, and others.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nDependabot has been helping GitHub users keep dependencies up-to-date since 2019. Millions of developers use it each month to stay on top of security vulnerabilities.\n\nOpen sourcing the proxy means you can now see exactly how your dependency updates are authenticated. This is especially useful for organizations with strict compliance requirements who need to audit the tools in their software supply chain.\n\n## Learn more\n\n- [Explore the Dependabot Proxy repository](https://github.com/dependabot/proxy)\n- [Learn about Dependabot and how it keeps your dependencies secure](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot)\n- [Read about dependabot-core, the open source engine that powers Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core)",
