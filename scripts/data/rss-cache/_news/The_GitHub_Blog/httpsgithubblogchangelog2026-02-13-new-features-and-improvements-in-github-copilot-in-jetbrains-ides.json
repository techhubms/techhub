  "EnhancedContent": "This update brings several improvements to GitHub Copilot in JetBrains IDEs. These include support for Agent Skills in preview, several user experience improvements across inline chat and settings, and quality enhancements for a smoother development workflow.\n\n## What’s new\n\n### Skills support in Agent Mode in public preview\n\nAgent mode now supports skills to help tailor Copilot for your workflows, reduce repeated setup, and load skill-specific content into context when needed. You can create your own skills for your projects or use those shared by the community, such as the [github/awesome-copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) or the [anthropics/skills repository](https://github.com/anthropics/skills).\n\n![Use Agent Skills in IntelliJ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28482613-518f-4ebc-a7b7-6083a6837b39)\n\n>\n> [NOTE]\n>\n> Agent Skills support in Copilot for JetBrains IDEs is currently in public preview. You can enable Agent Skills in your JetBrains IDE via **Settings &gt; GitHub Copilot &gt; Chat &gt; Agent**.\n>\n> If you’re a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscriber, an administrator will have to enable the **Editor preview features** policy before you can use it. Learn more in [our documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/policies).\n>\n\n## User experience enhancements\n\n### Inline chat improvements\n\nWe’ve introduced several improvements to make inline chat easier to use:\n\n- Quickly add the selected code to Copilot Chat as contextual input\n\n![Add selection to chat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535f4faf-c8fa-42ae-8d61-4b6696b32667)\n\n- Open inline chat directly from the floating code toolbar\n\n![Open inline chat from the toolbar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/549158d4-c079-43cd-b6a0-c588cdbb16f3)\n\n### Refined settings management\n\nThe Copilot settings experience has been refined to provide clearer navigation and structure.\n\n- **Toggle individual agents**: The updated Copilot settings page offers individual toggles, allowing you to enable or disable Agent mode, Coding Agent and Custom Agent independently.\n- **Sign-in reminder**: You’ll see a sign-in reminder in settings if you’re not authenticated.\n\n![Manage your configuration in settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68d8f44c-c950-4110-be1f-f85785000ba0)\n\nWe’ve also made a few additional usability improvements, including:\n\n- Smoother file navigation when collapsing or expanding files, helping keep conversations organised.\n- More intuitive prompt navigation with Home and End keys moving the cursor to the start or end of lines.\n- Redesigned chat and diff views for better readability.\n\n## Quality improvements\n\nQuality and reliability are also among our top priorities. We’ve made several improvements, including enhanced safety checks in file‑handling tools, increased stability for next edit suggestions, and persistent mode settings after restart.\n\n## Try it out\n\nWe encourage you to try out the [latest version of the GitHub Copilot plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot--your-ai-pair-programmer/versions) and share your feedback. Your input is invaluable in helping us refine and improve the product.\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nYour feedback drives improvements. We’d love to hear about your experience in the following channels:\n\n- **In-product feedback**: Use the feedback options within your IDE\n- **Feedback Repository**: Share your thoughts in the [GitHub Copilot for JetBrains IDEs issues](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-intellij-feedback/issues)"
