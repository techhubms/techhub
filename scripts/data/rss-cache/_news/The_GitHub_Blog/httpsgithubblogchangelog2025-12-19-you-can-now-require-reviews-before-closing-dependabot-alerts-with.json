  "EnhancedContent": "Delegated alert dismissal allows you to require a review process before Dependabot alerts are closed. This feature is available to GitHub Code Security customers and can be used in both the UI and API.\n\nThis helps you better manage security risk, as well as meet audit and compliance requirements. Delegated alert dismissal brings the same governance controls available for [code scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/managing-your-code-scanning-configuration/enabling-delegated-alert-dismissal-for-code-scanning) and [Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/using-advanced-secret-scanning-and-push-protection-features/enabling-delegated-alert-dismissal-for-secret-scanning) to Dependabot alerts.\n\nThis feature helps organizations:\n\n- **Increase accountability** across development teams when addressing vulnerability alerts.\n- **Prevent insecure activity** such as accidental or unauthorized dismissals.\n- **Manage alerts at scale** by making alert activity easier to govern and audit.\n\nDelegated alert dismissal for Dependabot is available for code security customers now on github.com and in GitHub Enterprise Server 3.21.\n\nTo learn more about Dependabot alert dismissal requests, see [our documentation about code security](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security).",
