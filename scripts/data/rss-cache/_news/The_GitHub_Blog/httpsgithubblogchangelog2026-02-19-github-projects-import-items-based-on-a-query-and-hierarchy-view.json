  "EnhancedContent": "## Import project items with a search query\n\nWhen creating a new project, you can now add items using a search query, in addition to importing directly from a repository.\n\nThis search supports the same [filters available](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#building-advanced-filters-for-issues) on the **Issues** page, including `AND` / `OR` keywords and nested queries, making it easier to start a project with exactly the items you want.\n\n## Hierarchy view improvements\n\nFollowing the [public preview of hierarchy view](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-01-15-hierarchy-view-now-available-in-github-projects/), we’ve shipped several improvements based on your feedback:\n\n- Create and add sub-issues inline, directly from a project.\n- Drag and drop to reorder and reparent sub-issues.\n- Keep sub-issue ordering in sync between issues and projects.\n\nWe’re continuing to invest in hierarchy view. Up next:\n\n- Avoid showing duplicate issues when they already appear in the hierarchy.\n- Preserve expand and collapse state between sessions.\n- Add filtering for sub-issues (for example, showing only open sub-issues).\n\nJoin the discussion within the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186435).",
