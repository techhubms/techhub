  "EnhancedContent": "We’ve redesigned where you manage Copilot coding agent tasks. We’re bringing a new look and feel to your [mission control style view](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-a-mission-control-to-assign-steer-and-track-copilot-coding-agent-tasks/?utm_source=blog-day1-recap-mission-control-cta&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25) directly into your repository with a new **Agents** tab.\n\nInstead of navigating to a separate page, your agent sessions now live alongside your code, pull requests, and issues. View all sessions for the repository in one place, create new ones, and switch between tasks without leaving your codebase. One-click links make it easy to jump straight to the associated pull request. You can also archive sessions to keep things organized and page through your session history.\n\n## Redesigned session logs\n\nSession logs are now easier to read and follow. Similar tool calls are grouped together, reducing noise and making the flow more clear. Tool outputs render inline previews, and file changes appear with the familiar diff views that you can expand with one click. Every tool call has a distinctive icon, and bash commands are now visible for full transparency.\n\n![A sample view of the Agents tab with a list of agents on the left and the interaction with the agent on the right.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbf6faf4-acab-4441-b3dd-2436b4af642b)\n\n## Resume with the Copilot CLI\n\nIf you prefer working in your terminal, you can now continue your Copilot session directly in the Copilot CLI. Click **Continue in Copilot CLI**, copy the command, and pick up right where you left off.\n\n![A menu with the option to Continue in Copilot CLI.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6d2909-f7dc-4f2b-b498-3e11a69a1b22)\n\n## To get started\n\n1. Navigate to a repository.\n2. Click on the new **Agents** tab.\n3. Create a task.\n4. To open your session in the CLI, click **Continue in Copilot CLI**.\n5. Copy the command and paste into [the Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli).\n\nNote: To view the **Agents** tab, ensure that you have Copilot coding agent [enabled for your repository](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/access-management).\n\nJoin [the community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/185364).",
