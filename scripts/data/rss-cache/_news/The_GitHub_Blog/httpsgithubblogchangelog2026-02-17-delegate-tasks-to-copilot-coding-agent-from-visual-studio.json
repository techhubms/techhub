  "EnhancedContent": "[Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent) is our asynchronous, autonomous background agent. Delegate a task to Copilot, and it opens a draft pull request, works in the background in the cloud, and then requests a review from you.\n\nYou can now delegate tasks to Copilot from Visual Studio. To start a background task, enter your prompt in Copilot Chat then click the new **Send to Copilot Coding Agent** button next to the **Send** button. Copilot will ask you to confirm, and then will open a pull request and start working in the background.\n\nCopilot coding agent is available to Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise subscribers. If you’re a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscriber, an administrator will have to [enable Copilot coding agent from the “Policies” page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/enabling-copilot-coding-agent) before you can use it.\n\nTo start tasks from Visual Studio, you’ll need to update to the latest version of Visual Studio 2026 (at least [December Update 18.1.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2026/release-notes#github-copilot-1)), and you’ll need to turn on the **Enable Copilot Coding agent (preview)** setting.
