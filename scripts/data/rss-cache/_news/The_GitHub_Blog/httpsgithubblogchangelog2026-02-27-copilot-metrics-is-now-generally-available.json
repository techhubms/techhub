  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Copilot usage metrics is now generally available, giving you a single place to see how your teams adopt and use Copilot. This way you can track trends, make informed decisions about rollout, and build reports that fit your organization.\n\nSince the [public preview at Universe 2025](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-copilot-usage-metrics-dashboard-and-api-in-public-preview/), Copilot usage metrics has expanded with organization-level visibility, fine-grained access controls, data residency support, and more. Here’s what you can expect now that it’s generally available.\n\n### What’s included\n\n**Dashboards**\n\n- Copilot usage dashboard provides clear, actionable insights into how your teams are using GitHub Copilot. The dashboard provides visibility into code completion activity, IDE usage, model and language breakdown, and more.\n- Code generation dashboard gives a directional measure of Copilot’s output by quantifying the lines it suggested, added, or deleted across completions, chat, and agent features.\n- Enterprise and organization-level granularity allows enterprise and organization owners to track adoption and usage trends for their teams without relying solely on enterprise-wide aggregates.\n\n**APIs**\n\n- **Enterprise-level**: Get a bird’s eye view of all Copilot usage across your entire enterprise for aggregate analysis on user engagement, Copilot usage, pull request throughput, and more.\n- **Organization-level**: Organizations can programmatically access their own Copilot usage to understand how teams are engaging with Copilot, spot trends, and assess enablement efforts.\n- **User-level**: Analyze individual Copilot usage for a specific day to support enablement and identify where teams may need training or better documentation.\n\nCheck out [our API documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/copilot/copilot-usage-metrics?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-copilot-organization-usage-metrics-for-a-specific-day) to learn more.\n\n### Access and availability\n\n- For access, navigate to your enterprise account → **AI Controls** → **Copilot** → **Metrics** → **Copilot usage metrics**. You should then see the dashboard under **Insights** → **Copilot usage** or **Code generation**. Please also ensure you are either an Enterprise Administrator, Billing Manager, or have the proper fine-grained permissions to have access to Copilot metrics.\n- Fine-grained access controls let you share visibility with the right people using custom enterprise roles, such as `View enterprise Copilot metrics`\n, without requiring full admin access.\n- Added support for GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency so enterprises with residency requirements can access Copilot usage dashboards and API reporting.\n\n### What’s next\n\nToday’s release delivers the data foundation for understanding Copilot adoption across your organization. The next question many leaders are asking is “is it working?” We’re building toward that answer—connecting usage patterns to engineering outcomes so you can move from tracking adoption to measuring impact. We’ll share more as these capabilities become available.\n\nTo get started, visit [Copilot usage metrics documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/copilot-usage-metrics).
