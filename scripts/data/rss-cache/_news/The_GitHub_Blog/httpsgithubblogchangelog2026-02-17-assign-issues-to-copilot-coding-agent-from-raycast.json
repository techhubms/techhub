  "EnhancedContent": "[Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent) is our asynchronous, autonomous background agent. Delegate a task to Copilot, and it works in the background, then requests a review from you.\n\nYou can now assign issues to Copilot from [Raycast](https://raycast.com), a powerful free launcher for Windows and macOS. Raycast can launch apps, search files, control your system, and leverage community-built extensions like the [GitHub Copilot extension](https://www.raycast.com/github/github-copilot).\n\nOnce you’ve installed the extension, you can assign an issue to Copilot using the “Assign Issue to Copilot” command. Select your repository and issue, then press Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd+Enter to assign the issue. Copilot opens a pull request, works in the background on your task, then requests review from you when done.\n\nWith the GitHub Copilot extension, you can also start new tasks without an issue using the “Create Task” command, and track the progress of tasks you’ve already started with the “View Tasks” command.\n\nCopilot coding agent is available to Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise subscribers. If you’re a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscriber, an administrator will have to [enable Copilot coding agent from the “Policies” page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/enabling-copilot-coding-agent) before you can use it.",
