You’ll now see better repository recommendations when you search.\n\n### We’d love to hear from you\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186360) to share your thoughts on these improvements, or to share what else you’d like to see in Copilot Chat on the web.",
