[GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) fits into that reality by helping you move from intent to reviewable diffs directly in your terminal—and then carry that work into your editor or pull request.\n\nThis blog walks through a practical workflow for using Copilot CLI to create and evolve an application, [based on a new GitHub Skills exercise](https://github.com/skills/create-applications-with-the-copilot-cli). The Skills exercise provides a guided, hands-on walkthrough; this post focuses on *why* each step works and *when* to use it in real projects.\n\n## What Copilot CLI is (and is not)\n\nCopilot CLI is a GitHub-aware coding agent in your terminal. You can describe what you want in natural language, use `/plan` to outline the work before touching code, and then review concrete commands or diffs before anything runs. Copilot may reason internally, but it only executes commands or applies changes after you explicitly approve them.\n\nIn practice, Copilot CLI helps you:\n\n- Explore a problem based on your intent\n- Propose structured plans using `/plan`\n(or you can hit Shift + Tab to enter planning mode), or suggest concrete commands and diffs you can review\n- Generate or modify files\n- Explain failures where they occur\n\nWhat it does *not* do:\n\n- Silently run commands or apply changes without your approval\n- Replace careful design work\n- Eliminate the need for review\n\nYou stay in control of what runs, what changes, and what ships.\n\n## Step 1: Start with intent, not scaffolding\n\nInstead of starting by choosing a framework or copying a template, start by stating what you want to build.\n\nFrom an empty directory, run:\n\n``` copilot\n> Create a small web service with a single JSON endpoint and basic tests\n```\n\nIf you want to generate a proposal in a single prompt instead of entering interactive mode, you can also run:\n\n``` copilot -p \"Create a small web service with a single JSON endpoint and basic tests\" ```\n\nIn the Skills exercise, this pattern is used repeatedly: describe intent first, then decide which suggested commands you actually want to run.\n\nAt this stage, Copilot CLI is exploring the problem space. It may:\n\n- Suggest a stack\n- Outline files\n- Propose setup commands\n\nNothing runs automatically. You inspect everything before deciding what to execute. This makes the CLI a good place to experiment before committing to a design.\n\n## Step 2: Scaffold only what you’re ready to own\n\nOnce you see a direction you’re comfortable with, ask Copilot CLI to help scaffold:\n\n```\n> Scaffold this as a minimal Node.js project with a test runner and README\n```\n\nThis is where Copilot CLI is most immediately useful. It can:\n\n- Create directories and config,\n- Wire basic project structure,\n- Generate boilerplate you would otherwise type or copy by hand.\n\nCopilot CLI does not “own” the project structure. It suggests scaffolding based on common conventions, which you should treat as a starting point, not a prescription.\n\nThe important constraint is that you’re always responsible for the result. Treat the output like code from a teammate: review it, edit it, or discard it.\n\n## Step 3: Iterate at the point of failure\n\nRun your tests directly inside Copilot CLI:\n\n``` Run all my tests and make sure they pass ```\n\nWhen something fails, ask Copilot about that exact failure in the same session:\n\n```\n> Why are these tests failing?\n```\n\nIf you want a concrete proposal instead of an explanation, try:\n\n```\n> Fix this test failure and show the diff\n```\n\nThis pattern—run (`!command` ), inspect, ask, review diff—keeps the agent grounded in real output instead of abstract prompts.\n\n💡**Pro tip:** In practice, `explain` is useful when you want understanding, while `suggest` is better when you want a concrete proposal you can review.

The CLI gives you a concrete diff instead of a wall of generated text.\n\n## Step 5: Move into your editor when you need to start shaping your code\n\nEventually, speed matters less than precision.\n\nThis is the natural handoff point to your editor or IDE, so it can:\n\n- Reason about edge cases\n- Refine APIs\n- Make design decisions\n\nCopilot works there too, but the key point is *why* you switch environments. The CLI helps you quickly get to something real. The IDE is where you can shape your code into exactly what you want.\n\nA good rule of thumb:\n\n- **CLI:** use `/plan`\n, generate a `/diff` , and move quickly with low ceremony\n- **IDE:** use `/IDE`\nwhen you need to refine logic and make decisions you’ll defend in review\n- **GitHub:** commit, open a pull request with the command `/delegate`\n, and collaborate asynchronously\n\n## Step 6: Ship on GitHub\n\nOnce the changes look good, commit and open a pull request which you can do through the Copilot CLI in natural language:\n\n``` Add and commit all files with a applicable descriptive messages, push the changes. ```\n\n``` Create a pull request and add Copilot as a reviewer ```\n\nNow the work becomes durable:\n\n- Reviewable by teammates\n- Testable in CI\n- Ready for async iteration\n\nThis is where Copilot’s value compounds as part of a flow that ends with shipping versus just being a single surface. The Skills exercise intentionally ends here, because this is where Copilot’s value becomes durable: in commits, pull requests, and review (not just suggestions).\n\n## One workflow, three moments\n\nA helpful mental model for Copilot looks like this:\n\n- **CLI**: prove value quickly with low ceremony\n- **IDE**: shape and refine your code\n- **GitHub**: review, collaborate, and ship\n\nCopilot CLI is powerful precisely because it fits into this system instead of trying to replace it.\n\n## Take this with you\n\nCopilot CLI is most useful when you treat it like a tool for momentum, not a replacement for judgment.\n\nUsed well, it helps you move from intent to concrete changes faster: exploring ideas, scaffolding projects, diagnosing failures, and handling mechanical work directly in the terminal. When precision matters, you move into your editor. When the work is ready to share, it lands on GitHub as a pull request—reviewable, testable, and shippable.\n\nThat flow matters more than any single command.\n\nIf you take one thing away from this guide, it’s this: Copilot works best when it fits naturally into how developers already build software. Start in the CLI to get unstuck or move quickly, slow down in the IDE to make decisions you can stand behind, and rely on GitHub to make the work durable.\n\nGet started with [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) or take the [Skills course &gt;](https://github.com/skills/create-applications-with-the-copilot-cli)",
