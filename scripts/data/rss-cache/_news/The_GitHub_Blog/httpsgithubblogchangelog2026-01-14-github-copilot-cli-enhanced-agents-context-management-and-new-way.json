  "EnhancedContent": "As we wrapped up 2025 and rang in 2026, we’ve continued to deliver new ways of working with agents in GitHub Copilot CLI while improving the terminal-native experience for all developers. Here’s what’s new since our last update.\n\n## New models and easier model management\n\n![This image shows the full model list of Copilot CLI, including new 0x models GPT-5 mini and GPT-4.1. One model, GPT-5.2, has not been enabled by this user, and they see a 'requires enablement' prompt to turn on access](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a818e6-cfdf-417f-9129-ffe4b5b46077)\n\n**GPT-5 mini** and **GPT-4.1**, models that are included with your Copilot subscription and do not consume premium requests on paid plans, are now available. Run `/model` to see all model options.\n\nIf you select a model that’s disabled in your policy settings, the CLI now prompts you to enable it directly—no need to leave the terminal. This works in the model picker, `/model` command, and `--model` flag for Copilot Pro/Pro+ users.\n\n## Built-in custom agents\n\n![This image shows the built-in explore agent searching the codebase for authentication patterns across the codebase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f83db7a4-ed8b-4d45-aa7b-e10b08f8d72a)\n\nCopilot CLI now includes specialized custom agents for common tasks:\n\n- **Explore**: Fast codebase analysis. Ask questions about your code without cluttering your main context.\n- **Task**: Runs commands like tests and builds. Receive brief summaries on success, full output on failure.\n- **Plan**: Creates implementation plans by analyzing dependencies and structure.\n- **Code-review**: Reviews changes with high signal-to-noise ratio, focused on only surfacing genuine issues.\n\nCopilot delegates to these agents automatically when appropriate and can run multiple agents in parallel.\n\nWhen combined with [Agent Skills](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-12-18-github-copilot-now-supports-agent-skills/), you can more easily integrate agentic workflows into yoiur Copilot CLI experience.\n\n## New ways to install\n\n**Windows (WinGet):**\n\n```bash winget install GitHub.Copilot\n\n```\n\n**macOS and Linux (Homebrew):**\n\n```bash brew install copilot-cli\n\n```\n\n**macOS and Linux (install script):**\n\n```bash curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash\n\n```\n\nPackage manager and install script installations **automatically update**.\n\n**Codespaces and dev containers:** Copilot CLI is included in the default GitHub Codespaces image and available as a [Dev Container Feature](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).\n\nStandalone executables are also available in [GitHub release artifacts](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases) for all platforms.\n\n## Automation and scripting\n\nNew flags make Copilot CLI easier to use in scripts and pipelines via `copilot -p` :\n\n| Flag | Description | | --- | --- | | `--silent` | Suppress stats and logs for clean, parseable output | | `--share [PATH]` | Export session transcript to markdown file | | `--share-gist` | Export session to a shareable GitHub gist | | `--available-tools` | Allowlist specific tools | | `--excluded-tools` | Denylist specific tools | | `--additional-mcp-config` | Add MCP config files per-session |\n\nRefer to `copilot --help` for a list of all optional flags.\n\n**CI/CD authentication:** Set `GITHUB_ASKPASS` to point to an executable that returns your token—useful for credential managers and pipelines.\n\n**Copilot Spaces:** The GitHub MCP server now includes Copilot Spaces tools for project-specific context.\n\n## Context management\n\n![This image shows the output of the /context command and the /compact command](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6088645-33da-4c29-a6cf-c97b7d51c7a3)\n\n- **Auto-compaction**: When approaching 95% of the token limit, Copilot automatically compresses your history.\n- **`/compact`**: Manually compress context anytime.\n- **`/context`**: Visualize token usage with a detailed breakdown.\n- **`--resume`**: Press `TAB`\nto cycle through local sessions and remote Copilot coding agent sessions.\n\n## Terminal experience\n\n- **Better diffs**: Intra-line syntax highlighting shows exactly what changed. It now integrates with Git’s configured pager.\n- **Tab completion**: Autocomplete paths in `/cwd`\nand `/add-dir` .\n- **Ctrl+T**: Toggle model reasoning visibility in supported models.\n- **Cleaner history**: Agent-run commands excluded from Bash/PowerShell history.\n\n## Web access controls\n\nThe new `web_fetch` tool retrieves content from URLs as markdown. URL access is controlled through `~/.copilot/config` with `allowed_urls` and `denied_urls` patterns. These rules also apply to shell commands like `curl` and `wget` .\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nUpdate with your package manager, or run `npm install -g @github/copilot@latest` .\n\nJoin the discussion in Copilot CLI’s [public repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli).",
