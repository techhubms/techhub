Pinned comments make it easy to surface key updates, decisions, or next steps, so anyone viewing the issue can quickly understand what matters most.\n\n## Fewer low-quality comments\n\nTo help keep issues focused, we’ve added a small nudge that encourages people to react and subscribe instead of leaving comments like “+1” or “same here.” This reduces noise, clutter, and unnecessary notifications, while still giving an easy way to show support and stay updated.\n\n![The comment window on an issue showing a warning to to keep the conversation focused and a button to like the issue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e49e7842-ea88-499e-b6e8-9349b9ffe8c3)\n\nJoin the discussion within the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186435).",
