Copilot CLI has grown from a terminal assistant into a full agentic development environment—one that plans, builds, reviews, and remembers across sessions, all without leaving the terminal.\n\nHere are some highlights from our fast-paced updates that make Copilot CLI ready for general availability.\n\n## Agentic development in your terminal\n\nCopilot CLI is more than a chat interface. It’s an autonomous coding agent that can plan complex tasks, execute multistep workflows, edit files, run tests, and iterate until the job is done. You choose how much control to keep, from approving every action to letting Copilot run fully autonomously.\n\n- **Plan mode:** Press Shift+Tab to switch to plan mode. Copilot analyzes your request, asks clarifying questions, and builds a structured implementation plan before writing any code. Review and approve the plan, then watch Copilot execute it.\n- **Autopilot mode:** For tasks you trust Copilot to handle end-to-end, autopilot mode lets Copilot work autonomously—executing tools, running commands, and iterating without stopping for approval.\n- **Built-in specialized agents:** Copilot automatically delegates to specialized agents when appropriate (e.g., **Explore** for fast codebase analysis, **Task** for running builds and tests, **Code Review** for high-signal change review, and **Plan** for implementation planning). Multiple agents can run in parallel.\n- **Background delegation:** Prefix any prompt with `&amp;`\nto delegate work to the Copilot coding agent in the cloud, freeing your terminal for other tasks. Use `/resume` to switch between local and remote coding agent sessions seamlessly.\n\nTo learn more about working effectively with Copilot CLI, head to our [best practices guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/cli-best-practices).\n\n## Your models, your choice\n\nChoose from the latest models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google, including Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex, and Gemini 3 Pro. Faster models like Claude Haiku 4.5 are available for quick tasks. Switch models in the middle of a session with `/model` , configure reasoning effort for extended thinking models, and toggle reasoning visibility with Ctrl+T.\n\nGPT-5 mini and GPT-4.1 are included with your Copilot subscription at no additional premium request cost.\n\n## Extensible with MCP, plugins, and skills\n\nCopilot CLI ships with GitHub’s MCP server built in and supports custom MCP servers for connecting to any tool or service.\n\n- **Plugins:** Install community and custom plugins directly from GitHub repositories with `/plugin install owner/repo`\n. Plugins can bundle MCP servers, agents, skills, and hooks. To learn more about plugins, head to our [documentation about installing plugins](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/plugins-finding-installing).\n- **Agent Skills:** Teach Copilot specialized workflows with markdown-based skill files. Skills load automatically when relevant, work across Copilot coding agent, Copilot CLI, and VS Code. To learn more about customizing Copilot CLI with skills, check out our [documentation on agent skills](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/create-skills).\n- **Custom agents:** Create specialized agents through an interactive wizard or by writing `.agent.md`\nfiles. Agents can specify their own tools, MCP servers, and instructions. To learn more about leveraging custom agents, see our [documentation on custom CLI agents](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/create-custom-agents-for-cli).\n- **Hooks:** Extend behavior at key lifecycle points. `preToolUse`\nhooks can deny or modify tool calls, and `postToolUse` hooks enable custom post-processing. Learn more in [our documentation about how to implement hooks](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/use-hooks).\n\n## Review, diff, and undo\n\n- **`/diff`:** Review all changes made during your session with syntax-highlighted, inline diffs. Add line-specific comments and submit them as structured feedback. Toggle between session changes and branch diffs.\n- **`/review`:** Analyze staged or unstaged code changes directly in the CLI for a quick sanity check before committing.\n- **Undo/rewind:** Press Esc–Esc to rewind file changes to any previous snapshot in the session.\n\n## Infinite sessions and repository memory\n\n- **Auto-compaction:** When your conversation approaches 95% of the context window, Copilot automatically compresses history in the background. Sessions can run as long as you need.\n- **Repository memory:** Copilot remembers conventions, patterns, and preferences it learns about your codebase across sessions, making future work more productive.\n- **Cross-session memory:** Ask about past work, files, and pull requests across sessions. Learn more in [our documentation about agentic memory](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-memory).\n\n## Install everywhere\n\nCopilot CLI runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows, and is available through npm, Homebrew, WinGet, a shell install script, and standalone executables. Homebrew, WinGet, and install script installations **automatically update**. Copilot CLI is also included in the default GitHub Codespaces image and available as a [Dev Container Feature](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).\n\nFor detailed installation instructions, head to our [getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/cli-getting-started).\n\n## Polished terminal experience\n\nSince public preview, we’ve invested heavily in making the terminal experience feel native and refined:\n\n- **Alt-screen mode:** A full-screen terminal UI with mouse text selection, **Page Up/Page Down** scrolling, and a dedicated footer status bar. This is currently available as an `/experimental`\nfeature.\n- **Theme picker:** Use `/theme`\nto choose from built-in themes including GitHub Dark, GitHub Light, and colorblind variants.\n- **Shell integration:** Copilot respects your `$SHELL`\nenvironment variable and supports the `!` prefix for direct shell execution.\n- **Keyboard-first navigation:** Full UNIX keybinding support (Ctrl+A/E/W/U/K, Alt+arrows), suspend/resume with Ctrl+Z, and a quick help overlay with ?.\n- **Ctrl+X, Ctrl+E:** Open your preferred terminal editor for composing longer prompts.\n- **Accessibility:** Screen reader mode, configurable reasoning visibility, and responsive layout for narrow terminals.\n\n## Enterprise ready\n\n- **Organization policies:** Administrators can control model availability through Copilot policy settings.\n- **Network access management:** Per-subscription API endpoints in accordance with GitHub’s network access management guidelines.\n- **Proxy support:** HTTPS proxy support.\n- **Authentication:** OAuth device flow, GitHub CLI token reuse, and CI/CD-friendly `GITHUB_ASKPASS`\nsupport.\n- **Hooks for policy enforcement:** Use `preToolUse`\nhooks to enforce file access policies, argument sanitization, and custom approval workflows.\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. [Install Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/cli-getting-started) using your preferred method.\n2. Run `copilot`\nand authenticate with your GitHub account.\n3. Run `/init`\nto generate Copilot instructions tailored to your project.\n4. Start building.\n\nCopilot CLI is available with Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise plans. For Copilot Business and Enterprise subscribers, an administrator must enable Copilot CLI from the Policies page.\n\nFor tips on getting the most out of Copilot CLI, check out our [best practices guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/cli-best-practices).\n\n## Looking for more information?\n\n- [Read the documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli)\n- [Learn more about Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli)\n- [Check out our product page](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli)\n- [Join the discussion in our public repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)"
