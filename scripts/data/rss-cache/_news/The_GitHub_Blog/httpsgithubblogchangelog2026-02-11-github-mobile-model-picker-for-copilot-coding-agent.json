Maybe you want to opt for faster responses when you’re on the go, or you want to pick a more capable model for deeper work.\n\nWhen you start a session in the app, use the model picker to select from:\n\n- Auto\n- Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5\n- Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6\n- Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5\n- OpenAI GPT-5.1-Codex-Max\n- OpenAI GPT-5.2-Codex\n\nIf you leave it on **Auto**, Copilot will automatically select a model to optimize for speed and performance based on availability.\n\nThis model picker is available now for Copilot Pro and Pro+ subscribers. Support for Copilot Business and Enterprise is coming soon.\n\nTo learn more, see the [documentation on model selection for Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/changing-the-ai-model).\n\nThe new experience is now available on the latest production build of GitHub Mobile on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android).\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
