This enhancement lets Copilot use the model’s built‑in web search to answer current events and other time-sensitive questions with more speed and accuracy.\n\n### What’s new\n\n- When enabled and where available, GitHub Copilot Chat on github.com will use model native web search.\n- Other models will continue to use [Bing search](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-10-29-web-search-in-github-copilot-chat-now-available-for-copilot-individual/).\n\n### How to try it\n\nThis capability is available to all public preview enabled paid Copilot subscribers.\n\nOrganizations and enterprises can enable this and other features in public preview by selecting **Opt in to preview features** in the Copilot in github.com setting.\n\nYou can try model native search today by asking about current events in GitHub Copilot Chat on github.com using any of the following models:\n\n- GPT-5.1\n- GPT-5.1-Codex\n- GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini (in public preview)\n- GPT-5.1-Codex-Max\n- GPT-5.2-Codex\n\nYou may also opt out of this functionality by toggling off the setting titled **Copilot can search the web using model native search** in [Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features).\n\n### What’s next\n\nWe’ll be rolling out this functionality across more models and contexts across GitHub Copilot. Join the discussion in the [GitHub community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/187783).",
