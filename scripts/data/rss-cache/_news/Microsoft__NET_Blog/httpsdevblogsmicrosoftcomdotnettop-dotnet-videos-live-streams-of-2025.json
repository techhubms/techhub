  "EnhancedContent": "It has been an absolutely outstanding year of content for .NET from creators around the globe sharing their passion for .NET and the .NET team giving insight into the latest and greatest in the world of .NET. From events, live streams, and plenty of on-demand content dropping on the [.NET YouTube](https://youtube.com/@dotnet) nearly every single day, it is a great way to stay up to date, but also get involved and give feedback to the team in real-time.\n\nIn 2025, the .NET YouTube channel welcomed 31.2K new subscribers (346K total), racked up 5.3M views, and reached 533.6K hours of watch time. Along the way, we posted 169 long-form videos (including 75 .NET Conf sessions), and hosted 149 live streams. That’s over 22,000 days of watch time – about 60 years! Thank you for watching, engaging, and subscribing ❤️\n\n## Top .NET videos of 2025\n\nIt was fun looking back at this year’s top videos as it really was a wide range of content.\n\n### Evergreen favorites (watched in 2025)\n\nSome of the channel’s biggest hits in 2025 were evergreen “start here” videos and learning series that keep helping new developers discover .NET:\n\n1.
