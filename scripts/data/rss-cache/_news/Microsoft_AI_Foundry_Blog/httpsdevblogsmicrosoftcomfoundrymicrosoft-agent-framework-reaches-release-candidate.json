Release Candidate is an important milestone on the road to General Availability — it means the API surface is stable, and all features that we intend to release with version 1.0 are complete. Whether you’re building a single helpful assistant or orchestrating a team of specialized agents, Agent Framework gives you a consistent, multi-language foundation to do it. Microsoft Agent Framework is the easy and most powerful way to build agents and agent systems using Microsoft Foundry or any model or AI service!\n\n[![devui screenshot image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAACkAQMAAAAXJ4E3AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHUlEQVRYhe3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAwI8BGPwAAU0SE3YAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2026/02/devui-screenshot.webp)\n\n## **What is Microsoft Agent Framework?**\n\nMicrosoft Agent Framework is a comprehensive, open-source framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI agents. It’s the successor to Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, and it provides a unified programming model across .NET and Python with:\n\n- **Simple agent creation** — go from zero to a working agent in just a few lines of code\n- **Function tools** — give agents the ability to call your code with type-safe tool definitions\n- **Graph-based workflows** — compose agents and functions into sequential, concurrent, handoff, and group chat patterns with streaming, checkpointing, and human-in-the-loop support\n- **Multi-provider support** — works with Microsoft Foundry, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Anthropic Claude, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, and more\n- **Interoperability** — supports A2A (Agent-to-Agent), AG-UI, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) standards\n\n## **Create Your First Agent**\n\nGetting started takes just a few lines of code. Here’s how to create a simple agent in both languages.\n\n**Python**\n\n``` pip install agent-framework --pre ```\n\n```py import asyncio from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIResponsesClient from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential async def main(): agent = AzureOpenAIResponsesClient( credential=AzureCliCredential(), ).as_agent( name=\"HaikuBot\", instructions=\"You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.\", )\n\nprint(await agent.run(\"Write a haiku about Microsoft Agent Framework.\"))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(main()) ```\n\n**.NET**\n\n``` dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.OpenAI --prerelease dotnet add package Azure.Identity ```\n\n```cs using System.ClientModel.Primitives; using Azure.Identity; using Microsoft.Agents.AI; using OpenAI; using OpenAI.Responses;\n\n// Replace <resource> and gpt-4.1 with your Azure OpenAI resource name and deployment name. var agent = new OpenAIClient( new BearerTokenPolicy(new AzureCliCredential(), \"https://ai.azure.com/.default\"), new OpenAIClientOptions() { Endpoint = new Uri(\"https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1\") }) .GetResponsesClient(\"gpt-4.1\") .AsAIAgent(name: \"HaikuBot\", instructions: \"You are an upbeat assistant that writes beautifully.\");\n\nConsole.WriteLine(await agent.RunAsync(\"Write a haiku about Microsoft Agent Framework.\")); ```\n\nThat’s it — a working AI agent in a handful of lines. From here you can add function tools, sessions for multi-turn conversations, streaming responses, and more.\n\n## **Multi-Agent Workflows**\n\nSingle agents are powerful, but real-world applications often need multiple agents working together. Agent Framework ships with a workflow engine that lets you compose agents into orchestration patterns — sequential, concurrent, handoff, and group chat — all with streaming support built in.\n\nHere’s a sequential workflow where a copywriter agent drafts a tagline and a reviewer agent provides feedback:\n\n**Python**\n\n``` pip install agent-framework-orchestrations --pre ```\n\n```py import asyncio from typing import cast\n\nfrom agent_framework import Message from agent_framework.azure import AzureOpenAIChatClient from agent_framework.orchestrations import SequentialBuilder from azure.identity import AzureCliCredential async def main() -> None: client = AzureOpenAIChatClient(credential=AzureCliCredential())\n\nwriter = client.as_agent( instructions=\"You are a concise copywriter. Provide a single, punchy marketing sentence based on the prompt.\", name=\"writer\", )\n\nreviewer = client.as_agent( instructions=\"You are a thoughtful reviewer. Give brief feedback on the previous assistant message.\", name=\"reviewer\", )\n\n# Build sequential workflow: writer -> reviewer\nworkflow = SequentialBuilder(participants=[writer, reviewer]).build()\n\n# Run and collect outputs\noutputs: list[list[Message]] = [] async for event in workflow.run(\"Write a tagline for a budget-friendly eBike.\", stream=True): if event.type == \"output\": outputs.append(cast(list[Message], event.data))\n\nif outputs: for msg in outputs[-1]: name = msg.author_name or \"user\" print(f\"[{name}]: {msg.text}\") if __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(main()) ```\n\n**.NET**\n\n``` dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.Workflows --prerelease ```\n\n```cs using System.ClientModel.Primitives; using Azure.Identity; using Microsoft.Agents.AI; using Microsoft.Agents.AI.Workflows; using Microsoft.Extensions.AI; using OpenAI;\n\n// Replace <resource> and gpt-4.1 with your Azure OpenAI resource name and deployment name. var chatClient = new OpenAIClient( new BearerTokenPolicy(new AzureCliCredential(), \"https://ai.azure.com/.default\"), new OpenAIClientOptions() { Endpoint = new Uri(\"https://<resource>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1\") }) .GetChatClient(\"gpt-4.1\") .AsIChatClient();\n\nChatClientAgent writer = new(chatClient, \"You are a concise copywriter. Provide a single, punchy marketing sentence based on the prompt.\", \"writer\");\n\nChatClientAgent reviewer = new(chatClient, \"You are a thoughtful reviewer. Give brief feedback on the previous assistant message.\", \"reviewer\");\n\n// Build sequential workflow: writer -> reviewer Workflow workflow = AgentWorkflowBuilder.BuildSequential(writer, reviewer);\n\nList<ChatMessage> messages = [new(ChatRole.User, \"Write a tagline for a budget-friendly eBike.\")];\n\nawait using StreamingRun run = await InProcessExecution.StreamAsync(workflow, messages);\n\nawait run.TrySendMessageAsync(new TurnToken(emitEvents: true)); await foreach (WorkflowEvent evt in run.WatchStreamAsync()) { if (evt is AgentResponseUpdateEvent e) { Console.Write(e.Update.Text); } } ```\n\n## **Migration from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen**\n\nIf you’ve been building agents with Semantic Kernel or AutoGen, Agent Framework is the natural next step. We’ve published detailed migration guides to help you transition:\n\n- [Migration from Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/migration-guide/from-semantic-kernel)\n- [Migration from AutoGen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/migration-guide/from-autogen)\n\n## **What’s Next?**\n\nThis Release Candidate represents an important step toward General Availability. We encourage you to try the framework and share your feedback — your input is invaluable as we finalize the release in the coming weeks.
