It now adapts to the available screen space by automatically adjusting how many items are displayed, and when there’s more content, expandable sections let you how more or less as needed.\n\n## Organized Event Categories\n\nEvents are now organized by category to make navigation easier and more intuitive. Each category can be expanded or collapsed as needed, includes visual color indicators for quick recognition, and displays event counts so you can immediately see how many items are in each group.\n\n[![events image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAZgAAARIAQMAAAAF81WeAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAATUlEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHwY3qAAAapbT3EAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/02/tc-b.webp)\n\n## Collapsible Sidebar\n\nThe side panel can now be collapsed to give you more screen space for viewing your calendar:\n\n## Event Color Customization\n\nYou can now customize the colors of your event categories to match your preferences or team conventions.\n\n## Searchable Teams\n\nFinding and switching between teams is now much easier with the new team search functionality.\n\n[![team picker image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAjcAAAG4AQMAAACD6FR9AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAANUlEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPwYe8AAARBfslAAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/02/tc-3.webp)\n\n## Dialog Improvements\n\nBoth event and days off dialogs have been updated with better usability.
