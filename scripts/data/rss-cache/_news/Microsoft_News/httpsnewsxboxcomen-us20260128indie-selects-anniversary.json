Like the previous year, to honor and thank these incredible developers for creating such beloved experiences, we invited them to reflect and share their thoughts on this question:\n\n*Looking back at the entire development process, what does it mean to your game studio to launch this project and receive so much high praise from both the gaming audience and critics alike?*\n\n### **[despelote](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/despelote/9pcs3q4jscvv) – Developed by Julián Cordero & Sebastian Valbuena**\n\n![Indie Selects Anniversary - Despelote](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2026/01/IndieSelectsAnniversary2026_AwardImage_Despelote_1x1-b89aa378fd055700d2fb.jpg)\n\n*Working on such a personal game for so long (almost 7 years), it was incredibly scary to press the release button and let people finally play it. It’s weird because the moment you press that button, it feels like the project stops being yours, and your journey with it has ended. But for everyone else, their journey with it has just begun, you just don’t get to see it.*\n\n*At first, I wanted to avoid reading stuff about the game because it was very hard to let go, but after reading some wonderful reactions to it, I feel very lucky that people have connected with the game to the extent that they have.*\n\n*I deeply enjoy reading reviews and comments about the game where people project their own lives into our game, because that is exactly how I tend to engage with art that I like. We had a hope that the more specific a story is, the more universal it becomes, and the reaction has been quite validating to this vision. We hope to be able to make more work like that in the future! – Julian Cordero, Developer of Despelote*\n\n[!\\[despelote\\](https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43219.14163872115911413.2879e5c1-b80c-4b56-8720-4785c97f85e0.d19a99a2-b5bd-44f3-b67c-06f78ca806ac?w=400&#038;h=600)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9pcs3q4jscvv)\n\n## despelote\n\nPanic\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ 18\n\n★★★★★\n\n$14.99\n\n[Get it now](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9pcs3q4jscvv)\n\nDespelote is a soccer game about people.

One of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities you never expect, but pour your heart into from day one.*\n\n*We were always aware of the responsibility that came with working on a franchise with a decades-long legacy and a passionate fanbase and that meant every decision carried weight. That’s why we approached Ragebound with the utmost respect for the original material, while also updating the formula to meet modern expectations.*\n\n*Seeing all that effort recognized, by both the press and players, has been the most rewarding outcome we could have hoped for. We’re incredibly grateful for the support and enthusiasm and we hope Ragebound plays a part in keeping the Ninja Gaiden legacy alive for a whole new generation!* – *David Jaumandreu, Game Director, The Game Kitchen.*\n\n[!\\[NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound\\](https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32236.14186314712076006.978d20b2-62d5-4e8b-b4ad-6c6161e1aeca.1e995cf5-0fb4-4783-8af0-71bd769e956f?w=400&#038;h=600)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9pgfslp8gwqk)\n\n![Xbox Play Anywhere](https://assets.onestore.ms/cdnfiles/sfw-service-web-onestore-onerf-2017-11-8-12/store/common/images/xpalogo_black.png)\n\n## NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound\n\nDotemu\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ 200\n\n★★★★★\n\n$24.99\n\n$18.74\n\n[Get it now](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9pgfslp8gwqk)\n\nPC Game Pass\n\nXbox Game Pass\n\nA NEW TWIST TO THE SIDE-SCROLLING NINJA GAIDEN SERIES EXPERIENCE\n\nFrom the acclaimed team behind Blasphemous, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound successfully unites the classic lore and gameplay of the Tecmo-developed (now KOEI TECMO GAMES) NINJA GAIDEN series from the classic era with the depth and intensity of the modern 3D entries. The best of both eras come together to create an epic and thrilling adventure. DIVE INTO AN UNTOLD CHAPTER OF THE NINJA GAIDEN SAGA\n\nOur story begins when Ryu Hayabusa journeys to America to honor his father's will. While he is away, the barrier between the human and the demon worlds suddenly shatters, unleashing a terrifying army upon the Hayabusa Village, which now faces an unprecedented threat in Ryu's absence.\n\nTo stand against this new threat, Kenji Mozu, a young ninja from the Hayabusa Village, rises to the challenge! Trained by Ryu, he fights fiercely but soon finds himself in desperate straits. Forced to tap into forbidden power, Kenji sets aside centuries of animosity and forms an alliance with the sinister Black Spider Clan, convinced that combining their souls and skills is the only way to protect the world out of the Demon Lord's grasp! OLD SCHOOL GAMEPLAY WITH A BRAND-NEW POLISH\n\nCombining old-school feeling with modern precision, NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound retains the pick-up-and-play action of the classic titles, while introducing new layers of depth.\n\nAlongside the new protagonist, Kenji Mozu, is the skilled assassin Kumori. Take control of these two powerful ninjas simultaneously and unravel their interconnected stories.\n\nUse the Ninja Fusion to unleash devastating abilities and obliterate your enemies. NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound features impeccable mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to truly master, challenging the skills of even the most seasoned fans of the NINJA GAIDEN series! A SPECTACULAR PIXEL ART SHOWDOWN\n\nStep into a reimagined version of the classic NINJA GAIDEN universe, brought to life through stunning, meticulously crafted visuals. Every enemy is recreated with a level of detail that was once impossible.\n\nThe brutal, nostalgia-filled aesthetic of NINJA GAIDEN: Ragebound pays homage to the past while pushing the boundaries of modern pixel art, making every battle a feast for the eyes. Do you have what it takes to become a true ninja master?\n\n### **[Cronos: The New Dawn](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/cronos-the-new-dawn/9p7tflq7ctxn) – Developed by Bloober Team S.A.**\n\n![Indie Selects Anniversary - Cronos](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2026/01/IndieSelectsAnniversary2026_AwardImage_CronosTheNewDawn_1x1-14d27fb05e6b8480462c.jpg)\n\n*Looking back at the whole development journey, launching Cronos means a lot to us, not just as a studio, but also as huge survival horror fans. From day one, this project was about bold ideas and pushing ourselves creatively, even if it meant taking some real risks along the way. It was also the first time we treated combat as something so central and complex. Creating a brand-new story and building a unique system around the merge mechanic was a big step for us. It felt like growing up alongside the game.*\n\n*The way the community has responded has been amazing. We love seeing all the content players create the theories they come up with, and how deeply they engage with the lore, which can seem a bit exotic. Inviting players from all over the world to step into Nowa Huta (New Steelworks) the game’s real-life location – felt a bit crazy at first but seeing how people embraced it has been incredibly rewarding. Community feedback has always mattered the most to us, and it keeps shaping how we think about what’s next.  – Wojciech Piejko, Jacek Zięba, Game Directors, Bloober Team S.A.*\n\n[!\\[Cronos: The New Dawn\\](https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26722.14100718395607935.4bbc5ddc-3736-4a1c-bf9c-aacab5689185.071f1d8f-17d6-4c38-b155-a009300eb09f?w=400&#038;h=600)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9p7tflq7ctxn)\n\n![Xbox Play Anywhere](https://assets.onestore.ms/cdnfiles/sfw-service-web-onestore-onerf-2017-11-8-12/store/common/images/xpalogo_black.png)\n\n## Cronos: The New Dawn\n\nBloober Team S.A\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ 213\n\n★★★★★\n\n$59.99\n\n[Get it now](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9p7tflq7ctxn)\n\nCronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.\n\nSURVIVE THE FUTURE. SALVAGE THE PAST Set in a grim world where Eastern European brutalism meets retro-futurist technology, Cronos: The New Dawn lets you experience a gripping story that straddles the line between past and future. In the past, you will witness a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that forever altered humanity. Meanwhile, in the ravaged wastelands of the future, every moment is a fight for survival against dangerous abominations that will test both your reflexes and your tactical thinking. You are a Traveler working for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of time rifts that will transport you to 1980s-era Poland.\n\nADAPT OR PERISH In a desolate world filled with ever-present danger, your survival hinges on your ability to strategize and plan ahead. The enemies you’ll encounter are nightmarish creatures, born from the remnants of humanity – defeating them will require you to make full use of your arsenal. You can manipulate temporal Anomalies to clear a path through the desolate environment, and will have to scavenge for resources to replenish your limited ammo and supplies. Good preparation is key. Once in battle, split-second decisions can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nDON’T LET THEM MERGE The creatures you kill won’t stay dead for long. Fallen enemies can be absorbed by others — through a grotesque process called Merging — to become faster, tougher, and far deadlier. The only way to stop them? Burn their bodies. And do it fast. If you don’t, you’ll face ever-evolving abominations that will push your combat skills to their limits.\n\nHARVESTER OF SOULS Your mission is to locate key people from the past who perished in the ensuing apocalypse. Using your all-powerful Harvester, you can extract their Essences and have them accompany you into the future. But be wary: these essences have a profound impact on your journey. The more you carry, the more haunted your suit becomes — increasing your prowess on the battlefield but also bringing with them whispers in your ear and flickers into your vision, edging you ever closer to madness.\n\n### **[I Am Your Beast](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/i-am-your-beast/9pf9fqgh89wm) – Developed by Strange Scaffold**\n\n![](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2026/01/IndieSelectsAnniversary2026_AwardImage_IAmYourBeast_1x1-8c6629518d4aafc152d8.jpg)\n\n*We’ve released 17 games in the last 6 years, and it not only made I Am Your Beast better–it let us build an audience for our unique voice.

We were constantly reminded of what we had lost. At times, that reminder was devastating — at others, strangely motivating. It was unpredictable, almost like a roulette.*\n\n*Since launch day, however, every player who finished the game feeling satisfied, or who found something meaningful in the story we told, has made that struggle worth it many times over. We held on to every word of praise — from players, and professionals alike — with genuine gratitude.
