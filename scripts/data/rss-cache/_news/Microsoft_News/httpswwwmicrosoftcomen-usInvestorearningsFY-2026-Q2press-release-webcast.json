In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by net losses from investments in OpenAI, which resulted in a decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share of $939 million and $0.12, respectively.\n\nMicrosoft has provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the impact from investments in OpenAI to aid investors in better understanding our performance. Microsoft believes these non-GAAP measures assist investors by providing additional insight into its operational performance and help clarify trends affecting its business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Constant Currency**\n\nMicrosoft presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars using the average exchange rates from the comparative period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. All growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period in the last fiscal year. Microsoft has provided this non-GAAP financial information to aid investors in better understanding our performance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**Financial PerformanceConstant Currency Reconciliation**\n\n| | **Three Months Ended December 31,** | | --- | --- | | ($ in millions, except per share amounts) | **Revenue** | **Operating Income** | **Net Income** | **Diluted Earnings per Share** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **2024 As Reported (GAAP)** | **$69,632** | **$31,653** | **$24,108** | **$3.23** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **2024 As Adjusted (non-GAAP)** | **$69,632** | **$31,653** | **$25,047** | **$3.35** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **2025 As Reported (GAAP)** | **$81,273** | **$38,275** | **$38,458** | **$5.16** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **2025 As Adjusted (non-GAAP)** | **$81,273** | **$38,275** | **$30,875** | **$4.14** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Percentage Change Y/Y (GAAP) | 17% | 21% | 60% | 60% | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Percentage Change Y/Y (non-GAAP) | 17% | 21% | 23% | 24% | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Constant Currency Impact** | **$972** | **$596** | **$558** | **$0.07** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Percentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency | 15% | 19% | 57% | 58% | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Percentage Change Y/Y (non-GAAP) Constant Currency | 15% | 19% | 21% | 21% | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n****\n\n**Segment Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation**\n\n| | **Three Months Ended December 31,** | | --- | --- | | ($ in millions) | **Productivity and Business Processes** | **Intelligent Cloud** | **More Personal Computing** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **2024 As Reported (GAAP)** | **$29,437** | **$25,544** | **$14,651** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **2025 As Reported (GAAP)** **** | **$34,116** | **$32,907** | **$14,250** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Percentage Change Y/Y (GAAP) | 16% | 29% | (3)% | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Constant Currency Impact** | **$580** | **$292** | **$100** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Percentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency | 14% | 28% | (3)% | | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n****\n\n**SelectedProduct and Service Revenue Constant Currency Reconciliation**\n\n| | **Three Months Ended December 31, 2025** | | --- | --- | | | **Percentage Change Y/Y (GAAP)** | **Constant Currency Impact** | **Percentage Change Y/Y Constant Currency** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Microsoft Cloud** | **26%** | **(2)%** | **24%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Commercial remaining performance obligation** | **110%** | **0%** | **110%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud** | **17%** | **(3)%** | **14%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud** | **29%** | **(2)%** | **27%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **LinkedIn** | **11%** | **(1)%** | **10%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Dynamics 365** | **19%** | **(2)%** | **17%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Azure and other cloud services** | **39%** | **(1)%** | **38%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Windows OEM and Devices** | **1%** | **(1)%** | **0%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Xbox content and services** | **(5)%** | **(1)%** | **(6)%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Search and news advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs** | **10%** | **(1)%** | **9%** | | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n****\n\n**AboutMicrosoft**\n\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” @microsoft) creates platforms and tools powered by AI to deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.
