It's actually in documents and emails and meetings and SharePoint your company data. Work IQ lets you bring the full context of your organization's data to any agent, like the Copilot CLI and Agentic AI assistant. Write in your terminal, and all you need to do is add a single MCP server. Once it's added, the agent can easily pull in any organizational data. All you have to do is ask. This is the missing piece of context for most applications, and it unlocks powerful workflows that you can use today. Here's a spec that was written in Word and it lives in SharePoint. I don't have to summarize this by hand, I just give Copilot the title of the document and a link to the repo and ask it to compare the spec to the implementation. Copilot. Finds the right spec through Work IQ, inspects the code and compares the two. It shows which requirements were implemented, which ones drifted, and what's missing. That's not just a search result, that's delegated execution. Now let's look at a harder problem. We had several meetings about a File Explorer version control feature, and nobody wrote down the architecture. So I asked Copilot to find the implementation plan. Draw it, Copilot reasons over meeting transcripts and emails. From work IQ and reconstructs the architecture and summarizes the decisions. These decisions were never formally captured, but they still exist under the hood. Copilot explores the problem space, plans the work, and reviews the result as it goes. It can select the right model per step without you having to wire up specific routing logic. You can also pick your model with a simple slash command. All of this without ever leaving the agent. Build real intelligence into your agent today with work IQ.\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kevinfoofenglii?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Kevin Foo](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kevinfoofenglii?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n14m\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nThis isn’t the first AI SDK.\n\nBut it may be the first mainstream, enterprise-grade move that treats work context as a first-class input — not an afterthought. What’s being opened up here isn’t just Copilot, but the agent loop itself, grounded in how teams actually work.\n\nThat transforms AI from a surface-level assistant into something that can reason across decisions, ownership, and tradeoffs over time. Productivity gains are easy to cite. The harder — and more consequential — step is making work legible to machines in ways humans can still trust, audit, and govern.\n\nWhen team context travels with the work, AI stops just helping people write code and starts helping teams remember why decisions were made. That’s the difference between short-term efficiency and durable progress.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply)\n\n1 Reaction\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ruturaj-sodha-677b323a6?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Ruturaj Sodha](https://in.linkedin.com/in/ruturaj-sodha-677b323a6?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n1h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\"Great insights, [Satya Nadella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment-text) While AI is transforming biology, at NYUROX, we are pushing the boundaries by using Computational Physics to predict neuro-metabolic shifts. 🧠 We’ve built an engine that detects Alzheimer’s and neuro-decay 18 months earlier than traditional structural imaging (MRI).

Teams have been building powerful AI tools, but without understanding the organizational context - the why behind decisions, the history of choices, the team dynamics - they often miss the mark. Work IQ bringing that context into the development workflow is a smart move. We see similar patterns in government technology implementations - the tools that succeed are the ones that understand the institutional context, not just the technical requirements.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [2 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n3 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://pt.linkedin.com/in/francisca-peixoto?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Francisca Peixoto](https://pt.linkedin.com/in/francisca-peixoto?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n30m\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_so-much-of-dev-work-happens-in-the-context-activity-7420485585376620544-vudJ&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nThis could be transformational for small, agile, flat hierarchy companies in which context is often provided informally and where discussions happen organically.
