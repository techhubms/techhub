  "EnhancedContent": "Microsoft South Africa and SABC today announced plans to bring accessible AI fluency and digital skills learning directly to millions of South Africans through the national broadcaster’s digital platform.\n\nAnnounced at the 2026 Microsoft AI Tour Johannesburg, this collaboration is driven by Microsoft Elevate, the company’s transformative initiative aimed at equipping individuals and organisations with the skills and tools needed to thrive in an AI-driven economy, and builds on the AI Skills Initiative, launched in 2025, where Microsoft pledged to train one million South Africans by 2026.\n\nSince inception of the AI Skills Initiative, Microsoft has engaged 4 million learners, trained 1.4 million individuals, and credentialed nearly half a million citizens. These achievements demonstrate the scale of impact already underway, and the SABC collaboration represents the next step in ensuring that inclusive access to digital skills reaches every corner of the country.\n\nThis collaboration comes at a time when AI skills are becoming critical for employability.  According to World Economic Forum [Future of Jobs Report 2025](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/digest/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOmQyOTAyZDJmYjkwZGNkMTQwYzFkZjhiNzgyN2E4MzdhOjc6ZmY0Yjo4MjkwYjM0OTFmODQwMjRiMzc1YTYyODFjYmIwODhlZWM0ZjE4NGM3ZjgxMjc1YzBlNzkyMjk0Y2Y4MTQ2ZGUyOnA6RjpG), global employers identify AI and data skills among the fastest growing through 2030, while [LinkedIn](https://economicgraph.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/economicgraph/en-us/PDF/ai-labor-market-update-header-sept-2025.pdf) reports AI hiring is up 25% year-on-year and AI literacy job postings increased by 70%, extending beyond technical roles. These trends underscore the urgency of equipping South Africans with future-ready capabilities.\n\nTogether, Microsoft and the SABC intend to integrate AI fluency modules, refresh digital literacy pathways, and co-brand digital badges into the SABC Plus platform. With just over 1.9 million registered users and approximately 25% active users, SABC Plus offers a powerful channel to democratise access to future-ready skills. Through the platform, learners will be able to consume content on-demand, complete assessments, and earn recognised credentials that strengthen employability in a rapidly evolving job market.\n\n“AI can be a powerful bridge to opportunity. By partnering with SABC, we aim to embed digital and AI skills into the daily lives of millions of South Africans. This initiative ensures that learners, educators, and job seekers alike can access practical, credentialed pathways that prepare them for tomorrow’s workforce. Democratising AI skills is not just a goal – it is our responsibility to shape a more inclusive digital economy,” says Tiara Pathon, Microsoft Elevate AI Skills Director, South Africa.\n\nThe programme underscores Microsoft’s broader mission to empower every person and organisation on the planet to achieve more, while aligning with South Africa’s national priorities to close the digital divide, prepare youth for the future of work, and ensure inclusive participation in the AI-powered economy.\n\n“South Africa’s future depends on how we equip our people with the skills to thrive in an AI-driven world. This commitment with SABC Plus is a milestone in our journey to scale access, accelerate employability, and empower communities. By bringing learning directly to where people are – on their devices, in their homes – we are turning ambition into real outcomes. Together, we are building a nation ready for the opportunities of the digital era,” says Vukani Mngxati, Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft South Africa.\n\nAccording to [Microsoft’s recent AI Diffusion Report](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/topics/AI-Economy-Institute/reports/Global-AI-Adoption-2025/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOmQyOTAyZDJmYjkwZGNkMTQwYzFkZjhiNzgyN2E4MzdhOjc6MmIzNzo5ZGQ5ZDE0ZGIwZGJjZmUwNWJmYjBjMGJjMWU4YjgzOWNlN2Y0M2RkOTMyZDg2MmRmNTZjOGZiNWE4MzlmMTE0OnA6RjpG), South Africa’s AI adoption rose from 19.3% in the first half of 2025, to 21.1% in the second half, a 1.8% increase.  Globally, generative AI tools now reach 16.3% of the population, up from 15.1% earlier in the year.\n\n“Yet, adoption in the Global North is nearly twice as fast as in the Global South, highlighting the need for inclusive programmes that help to bridge the digital divide,” says Pathon.\n\nThe report also highlights that countries (like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Norway, Ireland, France and Spain) that have invested early in digital infrastructure, AI skilling and government adoption, continue to lead. The countries that will advance the fastest are not only those building AI, but those putting it to meaningful use. The benefits of AI are expanding rapidly, but not evenly – a gap this collaboration aims to help narrow locally.\n\n“As South Africa’s only public broadcaster, the SABC has a mandate to inform, educate, entertain, and empower our citizens. SABC Plus, the biggest free to air internet-based platform in Africa, is a critical national platform for accessible educational programming. This partnership with Microsoft further strengthens our commitment to delivering relevant, future-facing learning at scale, while also investing in the development of critical skills in the broadcasting industry. Integrating AI and digital content into SABC Plus, we are opening new opportunities and ensuring that innovation serves the public good,” says Lungile Binza, SABC’s Chief Operations Officer.\n\nThe MoU with SABC builds on a series of transformative initiatives launched under Microsoft Elevate in South Africa:\n\n- [**Ikamva Digital**](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.ikamvadigital.org/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOmQyOTAyZDJmYjkwZGNkMTQwYzFkZjhiNzgyN2E4MzdhOjc6ZmJkNzoxZjkxZTFjNzgxNDY5NDBlZTQ1NTE5YzRhNjQ0MTg1MGUyOThlZDM2N2E1OTMzOTY3MmE4MDY1MmI1YmJmMzUyOnA6RjpG): A one-stop learning platform for educators and students across South Africa’s 50 Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges, offering five digital career pathways aligned with industry demand.\n- [**ElevateHer**](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/microsoft.elevatewomenin.tech/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOmQyOTAyZDJmYjkwZGNkMTQwYzFkZjhiNzgyN2E4MzdhOjc6MzdhNTozMGQ2NGI5ZmRjMjE5YzE3NjJkZWNlNzIwODAwYzY1MjhhY2M4OGRiNDc3NWI0YjM2NTllMzdmY2RjYTVlMzdiOnA6RjpG): Empowering 30,000 women with AI and digital skills to close the gender gap in technology.\n- [**Civic AI**](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/civicai.co.za/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOmQyOTAyZDJmYjkwZGNkMTQwYzFkZjhiNzgyN2E4MzdhOjc6ZmVlZToxMTU5MjcyZWY3ZTFkYmZmYzNkMWI2ZTA3Yzc2MTA4YTE4YzY0NmY2NzcwMzE2YTgwODMyZjQ4NGRhZDdlZDMxOnA6RjpG): Supporting non-profits with AI tools and training, targeting 30,000 individuals by 2026.\n- [**Youth Employment Service (YES) 50K Certification Programme**](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/yes-aiskills.co.za/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOmQyOTAyZDJmYjkwZGNkMTQwYzFkZjhiNzgyN2E4MzdhOjc6NzE4Yzo0ZDVjMDk3MjkwZGNjZjExM2Q5NTI4OTljZDIxYWRmMzZmYTdiYWZlZWNkNTkyM2VmNDYzMDJmOTg5YmI0YzgwOnA6RjpG): Providing 50,000 free Microsoft certification exam vouchers to young South Africans to boost employability.\n\nBy combining Microsoft’s experience in AI skilling with SABC Plus’s reach into millions of homes, the programme ensures that opportunity is not limited by geography, background, or circumstance. Together, the two organisations are creating pathways for learners, educators, non-profits, and job seekers to gain the practical, credentialed skills needed to thrive in the future of work.\n\nThis collaboration is more than a technology initiative – it is a commitment to empower South Africans with the tools to unlock potential, drive innovation, and shape a brighter, more equitable digital future.\n\n***Main image*** ***caption from left to right:** Lungile Binza, COO, SABC; Zia Mansoor, Microsoft Corporate Vice President of Data & AI and Vukani Mngxati, Microsoft South Africa CEO*",
