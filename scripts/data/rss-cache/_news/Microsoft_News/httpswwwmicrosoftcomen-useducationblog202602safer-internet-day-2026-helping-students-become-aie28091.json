  "EnhancedContent": "Safer Internet Day 2026 highlights how educators, families, and schools can help students become AI aware, safe, and smart online using trusted resources from Microsoft Education.\n\n/\n\nPowered by [!\\[\\](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/plugins/ms-cloud-marketing-modules/assets/images/logo-azure.png) Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/text-to-speech)\n\nSafer Internet Day 2026 brings together schools, families, and communities around the shared goal of creating safer, more empowering online experiences for every learner. It’s a moment to pause, reflect, and strengthen the digital habits, safeguards, and shared responsibility that help young people navigate an AI‑shaped world with confidence and care.\n\nThis year’s theme—*AI Aware: Safe, Smart, In Control*—recognizes how deeply AI now influences students’ daily digital lives. From learning platforms, creative tools, and online interactions, AI is embedded across the digital ecosystem. With these opportunities come new expectations for digital literacy and critical thinking.\n\nBeing *AI‑aware* means helping learners:\n\n- Assess content shaped by AI\n- Recognize manipulative interactions or misinformation\n- Protect personal data and digital identities\n- Navigate online spaces with confidence, curiosity, and discernment\n\n[Learn how the Microsoft Education Security Toolkit supports safer learning](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-microsoft-education-security-toolkit.html?lcid=EN-US)\n\nSafer Internet Day encourages institutions to integrate these competencies into digital citizenship instruction so students can engage with emerging AI technologies safely and responsibly.\n\n![A young person wearing glasses and a denim jacket sits smiling in a modern library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Edu-Sec-Toolkit-Blog-Hero-1920px-1024x683.jpg)\n\n## Introducing the Microsoft Education Security Toolkit\n\nTo support safer learning environments, the [new Microsoft Education Security Toolkit](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-microsoft-education-security-toolkit.html?lcid=EN-US) provides educators and IT teams with practical guidance tailored to the realities of modern education.\n\nThe toolkit includes:\n\n- Education aligned security frameworks based on [Zero Trust principles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview)\n- AI‑powered tools and implementation guidance for small and large teams\n- Data governance guidance for AI, learning analytics, and research environments\n- Resources for student‑run Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and cybersecurity skilling\n- Real campus case studies that demonstrate the impact security tools have made at institutions globally\n\nThe toolkit reframes campus cybersecurity—not as a barrier to innovation, but as a sustainable foundation that enables safe AI adoption, global collaboration, and resilient digital learning ecosystems.\n\n## Why AI safety and cybersecurity matter in education\n\nCybersecurity and digital safety are no longer “technical concerns”—they are essential to the mission of teaching and learning. Schools manage a wide range of sensitive information, including:\n\n- Student records\n- Learning analytics and accessibility data\n- Financial aid information\n- Digital credentials\n- Federally funded research outputs\n- Intellectual property\n\nCampuses are intentionally open environments designed for collaboration, inquiry, and innovation. Devices change hands, systems span cloud and on-premises infrastructure, and users move fluidly across networks. That openness fuels learning—but also increases risk.\n\nA single cybersecurity incident can disrupt instruction, halt essential services, delay research, and erode trust among students, families, faculty, and partners.\n\nStrong security does not restrict innovation; it enables it. A secure foundation allows institutions to adopt AI, expand access, and accelerate digital transformation with confidence.\n\n[Discover the potential of AI in education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/ai-in-education)\n\n## Building digital citizenship with Minecraft Education’s CyberSafe series\n\n[![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Minecraft-Bad-connection-1024x576.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fhHGYlQczk)\n\n[Watch the trailer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fhHGYlQczk)\n\nDigital citizenship begins long before college or career. Young learners need accessible ways to practice and internalize online safety skills without fear. [Minecraft Education offers a K–12 curriculum program](https://education.minecraft.net/discover/cyber-and-digital-safety) to help educators introduce online safety, digital awareness, and cybersecurity through immersive, age-appropriate learning experiences. The content was developed with experts across Microsoft, including Minecraft Player Safety, Xbox Trust and Safety, and the Microsoft Digital Safety Unit, and aligns to Computer Science Teacher Association (CSTA) and Cyber.org standards.\n\nIn the CyberSafe series for ages 8 to 14, students build critical thinking skills and learn positive online behavior as they explore digital risks in a safe, supported environment. The newest addition to the CyberSafe series, *Bad Connection?*, offers a trusted way to support digital citizenship and AI-aware learning through play for students ages 11 to 14. By introducing concepts in engaging game scenarios inspired by real life—such as manipulative interactions, suspicious messages, and peer pressure—students have a safe rehearsal space to practice:\n\n- Evaluating risks\n- Identifying red flags\n- Consider actions and consequences\n- Seeking help and report concerns\n\nThe goal is to equip students with language, strategies, and confidence to safely navigate online spaces and use digital technologies responsibly. By turning safety concepts into interactive experiences, CyberSafe helps reduce stigma, normalize conversations about unsafe interactions, and strengthen protective online behaviors. Minecraft Education offers free resources for educators, families, and school leaders as well as online training for educators.
