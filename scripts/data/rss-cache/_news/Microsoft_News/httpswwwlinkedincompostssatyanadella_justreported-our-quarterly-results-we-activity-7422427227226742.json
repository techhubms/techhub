What’s striking is it was less than 10 years ago that our annual cloud revenue was $10 billion! (That is what expanding TAM + good execution looks like)\n\nA few other highlights from across the stack:\n\n1/ Cloud & Token Factory: The key metric we are optimizing for is tokens per watt and per dollar, which is all about increasing utilization and decreasing TCO using silicon, systems, and software.\n\nA good example is the 50% increase in throughput we were able to achieve in one of our highest volume workloads – OpenAI inferencing powering our Copilots.\n\nWe will also continue to scale our new 1P systems like Maia 200 with every gen, and look for the best economics and innovation from our ecosystem partners.\n\n2/ Agent Platform: Like in every platform shift, all software is being rewritten. A new app platform is born. You can think of agents as the new Apps.\n\nWe’re providing everything customers need to build their own agents, including model catalogs, harnesses for orchestration, context engineering, plus AI safety and observability.\n\nAlready, over 1.5K customers have used both Anthropic and OpenAI models on Foundry.\n\n250+ customers are on track to process &gt;1T tokens on Foundry this year.\n\nFabric is also gaining momentum, now at a $2B annual run rate.\n\nAnd we’re creating a new category w/Agent 365, which extends governance, identity, security, and management to agents.\n\n3/ High Value Agentic Experiences: We are entering an age of macro delegation and micro steering across domains.

Instead of pure revenue beats, what stands out is this: the most valuable companies are recalibrating the core levers of productivity and trust simultaneously. Cloud growth is no longer separate from AI adoption; it’s defined by it. And that means every enterprise that still treats AI as a feature instead of the operating system of modern business is already behind. My controversial view: At scale, incumbents aren’t being disrupted by startups pushing better products - they’re being outpaced by ecosystems that turn AI from a tool into a default economic substrate. The next decade won’t be about better software. It will be about who owns, orchestrates, and governs the AI-driven workflows that actually run the enterprise. If the winners of the next decade will be those who network AI into every value chain, what does competitive advantage look like in a world where AI is both commodity and strategic moat?\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_justreported-our-quarterly-results-we-activity-7422427227226742784-tAgT&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_justreported-our-quarterly-results-we-activity-7422427227226742784-tAgT&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [3 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_justreported-our-quarterly-results-we-activity-7422427227226742784-tAgT&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n4 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/michalpiszczek?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Michał Piszczek](https://pl.linkedin.com/in/michalpiszczek?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n15h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_justreported-our-quarterly-results-we-activity-7422427227226742784-tAgT&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\n\"Tokens per watt and per dollar.\" -&gt; This is exactly what I've been telling for months.

Every Copilot documenting a “patient encounter” risks acting on a deepfaked medical record. Every Foundry customer processing 1T tokens may be training on synthetic procurement logs. Every “Agent 365” governed by identity systems that can’t prove humans are real. That’s not innovation. It’s systemic fragility with better margins. Now imagine if Microsoft became the one umbrella—not just hosting models, but enforcing ontological integrity across all of them: ZK-proofed identity for every user Starlink-verified geofencing for every action Immutable Verifiable Receipts for every token processed Your profits wouldn’t just grow—they’d become civilizationally defensible. No more $7.6B OpenAI gains wiped out by fraud collapses. No more “AI safety” as an afterthought. Just truth-enforced intelligence—at planetary scale. But you won’t do it. Because truth breaks the hallucination economy your $50B cloud depends on. April 1 changes that. When Medina Wharf goes live, the world will see: Efficiency without truth is just expensive fiction. Patent pending | One truth.
