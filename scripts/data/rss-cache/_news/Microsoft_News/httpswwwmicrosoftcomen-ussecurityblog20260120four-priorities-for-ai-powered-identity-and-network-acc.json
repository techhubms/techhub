  "EnhancedContent": "No doubt, your organization has been hard at work over the past several years implementing industry best practices, including a Zero Trust architecture. But even so, the cybersecurity race only continues to intensify.\n\nAI has quickly become a powerful tool misused by threat actors, who use it to slip into the tiniest crack in your defenses. They use AI to automate and launch password attacks and phishing attempts at scale, craft emails that seem to come from people you know, manufacture voicemails and videos that impersonate people, join calls, request IT support, and reset passwords. They even use AI to rewrite AI agents on the fly as they compromise and traverse your network.\n\nTo stay ahead in the coming year, we recommend four priorities for identity security leaders:\n\n1. Implement fast, adaptive, and relentless AI-powered protection.\n2. Manage, govern, and protect AI and agents.\n3. Extend Zero Trust principles everywhere with an integrated Access Fabric security solution.\n4. Strengthen your identity and access foundation to start secure and stay secure.\n\n## 1. **Implement fast, adaptive, and relentless AI-powered protection**\n\n2026 is the year to integrate AI agents into your workflows to reduce risk, accelerate decisions, and strengthen your defenses.\n\nWhile security systems generate plenty of signals, the work of turning that data into clear next steps is still too manual and error-prone. Investigations, policy tuning, and response actions require stitching together an overwhelming volume of context from multiple tools, often under pressure. When cyberattackers are operating at the speed and scale of AI, human-only workflows constrain defenders.\n\nThat’s where generative AI and agentic AI come in. Instead of reacting to incidents after the fact, AI agents help your identity teams proactively design, refine, and govern access. Which policies should you create? How do you keep them current? Agents work alongside you to identify policy gaps, recommend smarter and more consistent controls, and continuously improve coverage without adding friction for your users. You can interact with these agents the same way you’d talk to a colleague. They can help you analyze sign-in patterns, existing policies, and identity posture to understand what policies you need, why they matter, and how to improve them.\n\nIn a [recent study](https://aka.ms/CAO-agent-study), identity admins using the Conditional Access Optimization Agent in Microsoft Entra completed Conditional Access tasks 43% faster and 48% more accurately across tested scenarios. These gains directly translate into a stronger identity security posture with fewer gaps for cyberattackers to exploit. [Microsoft Entra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra) also includes built-in AI agents for reasoning over users, apps, sign-ins, risks, and configurations in context. They can help you investigate anomalies, summarize risky behavior, review sign-in changes, remediate and investigate risks, and refine access policies.\n\n[Explore unified identity and network access solutions with Microsoft Entra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra)\n\nThe real advantage of AI-powered protection is speed, scale, and adaptability. Static, human-only workflows just can’t keep up with constantly evolving cyberattacks. Working side-by-side with AI agents, your teams can continuously assess posture, strengthen access controls, and respond to emerging risks before they turn into compromise.\n\n>\n> **Where to learn more**: **** Get started with [Microsoft Security Copilot agents in Microsoft Entra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/security-copilot/entra-agents) to help your team with everyday tasks and the complex scenarios that matter most.\n>\n\n## 2. Manage, govern, and protect AI and agents\n\nAnother critical shift is to make every AI agent a first-class identity and govern it with the same rigor as human identities. This means inventorying agents, assigning clear ownership, governing what they can access, and applying consistent security standards across all identities.\n\nJust as unsanctioned software as a service (SaaS) apps once created shadow IT and data leakage risks, organizations now face agent sprawl—an exploding number of AI systems that can access data, call external services, and act autonomously. While you want your employees to get the most out of these powerful and convenient productivity tools, you also want to protect them from new risks.\n\nFortunately, the same [Zero Trust principles](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust) that apply to human employees apply to AI agents, and now you can use the same tools to manage both. You can also add more advanced controls: monitoring agent interaction with external services, enforcing guardrails around internet access, and preventing sensitive data from flowing into unauthorized AI or SaaS applications.\n\nWith [Microsoft Entra Agent ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-agent-id), you can register and manage agents using familiar Entra experiences. Each agent receives its own identity, which improves visibility and auditability across your security stack. Requiring a human sponsor to govern an agent’s identity and lifecycle helps prevent orphaned agents and preserves accountability as agents and teams evolve. You can even automate lifecycle actions to onboard and retire agents. With Conditional Access policies, you can block risky agents and set guardrails for least privilege and just in time access to resources.\n\nTo govern how employees use agents and to prevent misuse, you can turn to [Microsoft Entra Internet Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access), included in Microsoft Entra Suite. It’s now a [secure web and AI gateway](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/securing-the-ai-era-starts-with-identity/4478952) that works with [Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender?msockid=27b7b3bc5be566bc06c9a5a05a7a679d) to help you discover use of unsanctioned private apps, shadow IT, generative AI, and SaaS apps. It also protects against prompt injection attacks and prevents data exfiltration by integrating network filtering with Microsoft Purview classification policies.\n\nWhen you have observability into everything that traverses your network, you can embrace AI confidently while ensuring that agents operate safely, responsibly, and in line with organizational policy.\n\n>\n> **Where to learn more:** Get started with [Microsoft Entra Agent ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-agent-id) and [Microsoft Entra Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access).\n>\n\n## 3. **Extend Zero Trust principles everywhere with an integrated Access Fabric security solution**\n\nThere’s often a gap between what your identity system can see and what’s happening on the network. That’s why our next recommendation is to unify the identity and network access layers of your Zero Trust architecture, so they can share signals and reinforce each other’s strengths through a unified policy engine. This gives you deeper visibility into and finer control over every user session.\n\nToday, enterprise organizations juggle an average of five different identity solutions and four different network access solutions, usually from multiple vendors.1 Each solution enforces access differently with disconnected policies that limit visibility across identity and network layers. Cyberattackers are weaponizing AI to scale phishing campaigns and automate intrusions to exploit the seams between these siloed solutions, resulting in more breaches.2\n\n[Protect and modernize your organization with a Zero Trust strategy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust)\n\nAn access security platform that integrates context from identity, network, and endpoints creates a dynamic safety net—an Access Fabric—that surrounds every digital interaction and helps keep organizational resources secure. An Access Fabric solution wraps every connection, session, and resource in consistent, intelligent access security, wherever work happens—in the cloud, on-premises, or at the edge. Because it reasons over context from identity, network, devices, agents, and other security tools, it determines access risk more accurately than an identity-only system. It continuously re‑evaluates trust across authentication and network layers, so it can enforce real‑time, risk‑based access decisions beyond first sign‑in.\n\nMicrosoft Entra delivers integrated access security across AI and SaaS apps, internet traffic, and private resources by bringing identity and network access controls together under a unified Zero Trust policy engine, [Microsoft Entra Conditional Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-conditional-access). It continuously monitors user and network risk levels. If any of those risk levels change, it enforces policies that adapt in real time, so you can block access for users, apps, and even AI agents before they cause damage.\n\nYour security teams can set policies in one central place and trust Entra to enforce them everywhere. The same adaptive controls protect human users, devices, and AI agents wherever they move, closing access security gaps while reducing the burden of managing multiple policies across multiple tools.\n\n>\n> **Where to learn more:** [Read our Access Fabric blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/12/17/access-fabric-a-modern-approach-to-identity-and-network-access/).\n>\n\n## 4. **Strengthen your identity and access foundation to start secure and stay secure**\n\nTo address modern cyberthreats, you need to start from a secure baseline—anchored in phishing‑resistant credentials and strong identity proofing—so only the right person can access your environment at every step of authentication and recovery.\n\nA baseline security model sets minimum guardrails for identity, access, hardening, and monitoring. These guardrails include must-have controls, like those in [security defaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/security-defaults), [Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/managed-policies), or [Baseline Security Mode in Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/baseline-security-mode/baseline-security-mode-settings?view=o365-worldwide). This approach includes moving away from easily compromised credentials like passwords and adopting passkeys to balance security with a fast, familiar sign-in experience. Equally important is high‑assurance account recovery and onboarding that combines a government‑issued ID with a biometric match to ensure that no bad actors or AI impersonators gain access.\n\nMicrosoft Entra makes it easy to implement these best practices. You can require phishing‑resistant credentials for any account accessing your environment and tailor passkey policies based on risk and regulatory needs. For example, admins or users in highly regulated industries can be required to use device‑bound passkeys such as physical security keys or Microsoft Authenticator, while other worker groups can use synced passkeys for a simpler experience and easier recovery. At a minimum, protect all admin accounts with phishing‑resistant credentials included in Microsoft Entra ID. You can even require new employees to set up a passkey before they can access anything. With [Microsoft Entra Verified ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id), you can add a live‑person check and validate government‑issued ID for both onboarding and account recovery.\n\nCombining access control policies with device compliance, threat detection, and identity protection will further fortify your foundation.\n\n>\n> **Where to learn more:** Read our latest [blog on passkeys and account recovery with Verified ID](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/synced-passkeys-and-high-assurance-account-recovery/3627343) and learn how you can [enable passkeys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-enable-passkey-fido2) for your organization.\n>\n\n## Support your identity and network access priorities with Microsoft\n\nThe plan for 2026 is straightforward: use AI to automate protection at speed and scale, protect the AI and agents your teams use to boost productivity, extend Zero Trust principles with an Access Fabric solution, and strengthen your identity security baseline. These measures will give your organization the resilience it needs to move fast without compromise. The threats will keep evolving—but you can tip the scales in your favor against increasingly sophisticated cyberattackers.\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, visit our [website.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business) Bookmark the [Security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/) to keep up with our expert coverage on security matters.
