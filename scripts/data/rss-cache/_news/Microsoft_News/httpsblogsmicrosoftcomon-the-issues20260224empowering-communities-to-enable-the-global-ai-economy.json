In 2022, we made a [bold commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/12/14/expanding-africa-connectivity-skills/) to expand internet access to 250 million people by the end of 2025. Today, we are proud to share that we have met and exceeded that goal, extending connectivity coverage to over 299 million people worldwide, including more than 124 million across Africa.\n\nThis milestone represents more than a number. It reflects more than a decade of sustained collaboration with governments, nonprofits, local connectivity providers, and development partners around the world. Together, we have worked to reach communities where access has historically been limited, building pathways to education, healthcare, economic opportunity, and digital participation.\n\n[![](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/FY26_OML_Q2_PA_Sustainability_Connectivity-Milestone_Blog_Header_Internal_Graphic_V4_OP2.3.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/FY26_OML_Q2_PA_Sustainability_Connectivity-Milestone_Blog_Header_Internal_Graphic_V4_OP2.3.png)\n\nReaching this milestone is also a moment of reflection and renewal. Building on years of progress, Microsoft is evolving its approach to digital access to focus not only on coverage, but on adoption, enablement, and long-term participation in the AI economy.\n\nAs part of this next chapter, we are announcing a new collaboration with Starlink. This collaboration expands the set of tools available to help deliver digital access in rural, agricultural, and hard-to-reach communities. Combined with local delivery partners and community institutions, it strengthens the foundation for AI-ready communities around the world.\n\n### Why digital access matters in the AI era\n\nDespite continued progress, [2.2 billion people globally remain offline](https://www.itu.int/itu-d/reports/statistics/facts-figures-2025/), and many more face barriers related to affordability, reliability, or access to relevant digital services. These gaps already limit opportunity and risk widening as AI becomes more central to how economies grow and societies function.\n\n[![](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Figures-2026-0106-Pyramid-01.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Figures-2026-0106-Pyramid-01.png)\n\nAt Mobile World Congress 2024, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith shared our [AI Access Principles,](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/02/26/microsoft-ai-access-principles-responsible-mobile-world-congress/) underscoring that electricity and connectivity are essential foundations for an inclusive AI economy. Since then, the pace of change has only accelerated. In fact, [Microsoft’s 2025 AI Diffusion Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Microsoft-AI-Diffusion-Report-2025-H2.pdf?msockid=0ccb913e5f6769721efa847f5e4a687d) shows that AI is being adopted faster than any general-purpose technology in history, yet adoption remains uneven. As the data illustrates, adoption in the Global North is accelerating faster than in the Global South. Differences in infrastructure, access to tools, and digital readiness all contribute to a growing divide between higher-income and lower-income economies.\n\n[![](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/image-46.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/image-46.png)\n\nThis [graphic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Microsoft-AI-Diffusion-Report-2025-H2.pdf) from the 2025 AI Diffusion Report reinforces a clear insight: access to AI alone is not enough. For communities to participate meaningfully in the digital and AI era, connectivity must be paired with reliable energy, affordable devices, digital skills, and technologies designed for real-world use. Where these conditions exist, adoption follows. In Zambia, for example, country-wide generative AI adoption is 12 percent, but among those with internet access, it rises to 34 percent.\n\n### Deepening Microsoft’s approach to digital access\n\nBuilding on what we have learned, Microsoft is advancing a more holistic digital access model that recognizes connectivity as only one part of a broader system. In practice, this means collaboration to deliver not only internet access but also more reliable energy infrastructure, access to water where relevant, devices, digital skills, and cloud and AI tools, all designed and deployed for the communities they serve. By working across organizations and governments to address these foundational needs in parallel, this approach helps ensure that digital access is usable, durable, and capable of supporting real-world outcomes.\n\nA central focus of this work is community-based access models that are financially sustainable, scalable, and aligned with national development priorities. These models bring together local institutions such as schools, health facilities, cooperatives, and community hubs and are implemented in partnership with governments, businesses, nonprofits, and development finance organizations. By integrating infrastructure, enablement, and financing from the outset, these holistic programs can help unlock long-term investment, support responsible growth, and enable communities to fully participate in the digital and AI economy.\n\nDigital access directly complements [Microsoft’s Community First AI Infrastructure approach](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/) by providing the foundation that enables AI to be adopted, used, and trusted by communities everywhere.\n\n### Partnering to deliver impact at scale\n\nProgress at this scale is only possible through strong partnerships rooted in local delivery, community trust, and long-term sustainability. Microsoft’s work to extend connectivity to more than 299 million people has been built alongside partners who understand the realities of last-mile deployment and digital adoption.\n\nIn Africa, Microsoft works with partners such as [Cassava Technologies](https://www.cassavatechnologies.com/) to expand regional digital infrastructure and drive high-quality internet access across South Africa, Malawi, Kenya, and Zambia. Collaborations with local providers like [Tizeti](https://www.tizeti.com/) deliver affordable, reliable connectivity through solar-powered Wi-Fi networks across Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nIn Latin America, Microsoft’s partnership with [Anditel](https://www.anditel.com/) focuses on expanding internet and energy access for rural and agrarian communities in Colombia through locally led models aligned with national priorities. In India, Microsoft works with [AirJaldi](https://airjaldi.com/) to pair affordable connectivity with digital skills training and practical pathways for use, helping communities move beyond basic access toward meaningful adoption.\n\nThese partnerships made reaching the 250 million milestone possible. They also reflect a principle that continues to guide our work. Lasting digital access is built with communities, not for them.\n\n### Expanding the portfolio: Collaboration with Starlink\n\nBuilding on this foundation, Microsoft continues to expand and diversify its portfolio to reach communities where traditional infrastructure alone cannot meet demand.\n\nThrough our collaboration with Starlink, Microsoft is combining low-Earth orbit satellite connectivity with community-based deployment models and local ecosystem partnerships. This is intended to expand the set of tools available to deliver digital access while remaining firmly embedded in a holistic, partnership-driven approach.\n\nKenya offers an early example of this model in practice. Working with Starlink and local internet service provider [Mawingu Networks](https://mawingu.co/), Microsoft is supporting connectivity for 450 community hubs across rural and underserved regions, including farmer cooperatives, aggregation centers, and digital hubs. These deployments combine satellite connectivity with digital skills, tools, and ecosystem coordination to support agricultural productivity, access to markets, and adoption of digital and AI-enabled services.\n\n### Beyond 250 million: Building AI-ready communities\n\nSurpassing the 250 million connectivity milestone is a moment to celebrate. It is also a starting point for what comes next.\n\nThe next chapter of Microsoft’s digital access work is planned to focus on ensuring that access translates into adoption, use, and long-term opportunity. By continuing to partner with governments, development finance institutions, nonprofits, and private-sector partners, and by expanding into energy access, financing mechanisms, and community-first AI solutions, Microsoft is working to ensure that everyone, everywhere, can participate in the digital and AI economy.\n\nTags: [AI](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ai/), [AI diffusion](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ai-diffusion/), [AI economy](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ai-economy/)"
