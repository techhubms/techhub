What began as a research partnership has grown into one of the most consequential collaborations in technology — grounded in mutual trust, deep technical integration, and a long‑term commitment to innovation.\n\nAs conversations around AI investments and partnerships grow and as OAI announces new funding and new partners as they did today, we want to ensure these announcements are understood within the existing construct of our partnership. Nothing about today’s announcements in any way changes the terms of the Microsoft and OpenAI relationship that have been previously shared in [our joint blog in October 2025](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/10/28/the-next-chapter-of-the-microsoft-openai-partnership/).\n\n**The partnership remains strong and central.** Microsoft and OpenAI continue to work closely across research, engineering, and product development, building on years of deep collaboration and shared success.\n\n**Our IP relationship continues unchanged.** Microsoft maintains its exclusive license and access to intellectual property across OpenAI models and products. Collaborations like the partnership between OpenAI and Amazon were always contemplated under our agreements and Microsoft is excited to see what they build together.\n\n**Our commercial and revenue share relationship remains unchanged.** The ongoing revenue share arrangement remains unchanged and has always included sharing revenue from partnerships between OpenAI and other cloud providers.\n\n**Azure remains the exclusive cloud provider of stateless OpenAI APIs.** Microsoft is the exclusive cloud provider for stateless APIs that provide access to OpenAI’s models and IP. These APIs can be purchased from Microsoft or directly from OpenAI. Customers and developers benefit from Azure’s global infrastructure, security, and enterprise-grade capabilities at scale. Any stateless API calls to OpenAI models that result from a collaboration between OpenAI and any third party – including Amazon – would be hosted on Azure.\n\n**OpenAI’s first party products, including Frontier, will continue to be hosted on Azure.**\n\n**AGI definition and processes are unchanged.** The contractual definition of AGI and the process for determining if it has been achieved remains the same.\n\n**The partnership supports OpenAI’s growth.** As OpenAI scales, it continues to have flexibility to commit to additional compute elsewhere, including through large-scale infrastructure initiatives such as the Stargate project.\n\nThe partnership was designed to give Microsoft and OpenAI room to pursue new opportunities independently, while continuing to collaborate, which each company is doing, together and independently.\n\nWe remain committed to our partnership and to the shared mission that brought us together. We continue to work side‑by‑side to deliver powerful AI tools, advance responsible development, and ensure that AI benefits people and organizations everywhere.\n\nTags: [AI](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/tag/ai/)",
