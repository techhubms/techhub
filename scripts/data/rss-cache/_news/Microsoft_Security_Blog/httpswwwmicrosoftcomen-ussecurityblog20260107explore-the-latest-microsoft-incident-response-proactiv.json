  "EnhancedContent": "As cyberthreats become faster, harder to detect, and more sophisticated, organizations must focus on building resilience—strengthening their ability to prevent, withstand, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. Resilience can mean the difference between containing an incident with minimal disruption and becoming the next headline.\n\nFor more than a decade, [Microsoft Incident Response](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-incident-response) has been at the forefront of the world’s most complex cyberattacks, helping organizations investigate, contain, and recover from incidents. That real-world experience also informs our proactive services, which help organizations improve readiness before an incident occurs. To further help organizations before, during, and after a cyber incident, we’re excited to introduce new proactive incident response services designed to help organizations build resilience and minimize disruption.\n\n## Microsoft Incident Response\n\nStrengthen your security with intelligence-driven incident response from Microsoft.\n\n[Explore the portfolio](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-incident-response)\n\n![CISO (chief information security officer) collaborating with practitioners in a security operations center.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CLO22_SecOps_001.jpg)\n\n## **Expanded proactive services to enhance resilience**\n\nDelivered by the same experts who handle real-world crises, Microsoft proactive services equip security teams with insights and skills to be informed, resilient, and ready—because the best response is one you never need to make.\n\n- **Incident response plan development**: We assist organizations in developing their own incident response plan, using lessons from real-world incidents.\n- **Major event support**: We provide dedicated teams during critical events—such as corporate conferences or sporting events—actively monitoring emerging cyberthreats and acting instantly to prevent incidents and interruptions.\n- **Cyber range**: **** Microsoft Incident Response delivers simulations that provide high-fidelity, hands-on experience in a controlled environment. Security teams engage directly with threat actor tactics, using Microsoft security tools to detect, investigate, and contain cyberthreats in real time. This immersive approach builds confidence, muscle memory, and validates playbooks before an actual incident occurs using tools customers already own.\n- **Advisory**: **** We offer one-on-one, customized engagements, offering strategic recommendations, industry-specific consulting, and expert guidance informed by current threat actor activity and the latest incident response engagements. These services provide on-demand access to Microsoft Incident Response and cybersecurity experts, empowering leadership and technical teams to make informed decisions that reduce risk and accelerate resilience.\n- **Mergers and acquisitions compromise assessment**: **** Microsoft Incident Response offers a targeted compromise assessment performed during or around a merger, acquisition, or divestiture to determine whether the organization being acquired—or the environment being integrated—has been previously or is currently compromised by threat actors.\n\n## **Building on a strong proactive foundation**\n\nThese new services build on Microsoft Incident Response’s established proactive offerings, which are trusted by organizations of all sizes and across industries.\n\n- Our popular **compromise assessment** delivers deep forensic investigations to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs), threat actor activity, and vulnerabilities hidden in your environment. This service includes advanced threat hunting and forensic examination, providing actionable recommendations to harden your security posture.\n- **Identity assessment** offers a targeted evaluation of the identity control plane, pinpointing weaknesses in authentication and access policies. By addressing these gaps early, organizations reduce exposure to credential-based attacks and help ensure identity systems remain resilient against evolving cyberthreats.\n- **Identity hardening** works with organizations to deploy policies and configurations that block unauthorized access and strengthen authentication mechanisms. Engineers provide proven containment and recovery strategies to secure the identity control plane.\n- **Tabletop exercises** go beyond theory by immersing leadership, legal, and technical teams in realistic scenarios involving an incident. These sessions expose gaps in defenses and response plans, sharpen decision-making under pressure, and foster alignment on regulatory obligations and executive communications.\n\n## **Make resilience your strongest defense**\n\nIncident response isn’t just about reacting to incidents—it’s giving organizations the confidence and capabilities needed to prevent them. [Microsoft Incident Response](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-incident-response) helps customers move from security uncertainty to clarity and readiness with expert-led preparation, gap detection, defense hardening, and tailored threat insights. By investing in proactive services, you reduce risk, accelerate recovery, and strengthen your security posture before threats strike. Don’t wait for an incident to test your resilience—invest in proactive defense today.\n\n[Learn more about Microsoft Incident Response](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-incident-response)\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, visit our [website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business). Bookmark the [Security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/) to keep up with our expert coverage on security matters.
