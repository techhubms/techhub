  "EnhancedContent": "The insights gained from Cybersecurity Awareness Month, right through to [Microsoft Ignite 2025](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home), demonstrate that security remains a top priority for business leaders. It serves as a strategic lever for organizational growth, fosters trust, and facilitates the advancement of AI innovation. The [Work Trend Index 2025](https://news.microsoft.com/annual-work-trend-index-2025/) indicates that over 80% of leaders are currently utilizing agents or plan to do so within the next 12 to 18 months. While AI introduces risks such as oversharing, data leakage, compliance gaps, and agent sprawl, business and security leaders can address these issues in part by:\n\n1. Preparing for the integration of AI and agents.\n2. Strengthening training so that everyone has the necessary skills.\n3. Fostering a culture that prioritizes cybersecurity.\n\n[Microsoft guide for securing the AI-powered enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/emerging-trends/ai-security-guide)\n\n## Preparing for the integration of AI and intelligent agents\n\nPreparing for AI and agent integration calls for careful strategy, thoughtful business planning, and organization-wide adoption under solid governance, security, and management. [Microsoft’s AI adoption model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/emerging-trends/ai-security-guide) offers a step-by-step guide for businesses embarking on this journey and the guide offers actionable insights and solutions to manage AI risks.\n\n## Strengthening training so that everyone has the necessary skills\n\nTechnology alone isn’t enough. People are your strongest defense—and the foundation of trust. That’s why skilling emerged as a central theme throughout these past months and will continue beyond. [Frontier Firms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born)—those structured around on-demand intelligence and powered by “hybrid” teams of humans plus agents—lead by fostering a culture of continuous learning. Our blog “[Building human-centric security skills for AI](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftlearnblog/building-human-centric-security-skills-for-ai/4137355?wt.mc_id=learnmicrosoftai_securitypaper_blog_wwl_cloud)” offers insights and guidance you can apply in your organization.\n\n- **Lean into your unique human strengths**:****Your team’s judgment, creativity, and experience are irreplaceable. Take time to invest in upskilling and reskilling them, so they can confidently guide and manage AI tools responsibly and securely. Explore [Microsoft Learn for Organizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/organizations?wt.mc_id=learnmicrosoftai_securitypaper_blog_wwl_cloud) for resources to support your learning journey.\n- **Stay curious and agile through continuous learning**:****Building security resilience is an ongoing process. Regularly refresh your AI and security training, offer time and resources for employees to explore new skills, and create a supportive, engaging environment that motivates continuous growth. Find in [AI Skills Navigator](https://aka.ms/ASN_SecurityBlog), our agentic learning space, AI and security training tailored to different roles.\n\nInvesting in skilling doesn’t just reduce risk—it accelerates innovation by giving teams the confidence to explore new AI capabilities securely.\n\n> >\n> Skilling is an ongoing practice that needs to constantly evolve alongside the business and technology landscape. Staying ahead requires an enterprise-wide strategy that aligns ever-changing business priorities with always-on skill-building.\n> >\n> —Jeana Jorgensen, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Learning\n\n## Fostering a culture that prioritizes security\n\nAs AI impacts everyone’s role, make security awareness and responsible AI practices shared priorities. Encourage your team to weave security thinking into their daily routines—creating a safer environment for all. As Vasu Jakkal, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Security highlighted in her blog “[Cybersecurity Awareness Month: Security starts with you](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/01/cybersecurity-awareness-month-security-starts-with-you/),” it is critical that security become part of your organization’s culture and norms.\n\nCheck out our new e-book, [Skilling for Secure AI: How Frontier Firms Lead the Way](https://aka.ms/SkillingForSecureAI_cloud) for practical steps for leaders to upskill their workforce in identity management, data governance, and responsible AI practices.\n\n## From awareness to action\n\nIn the agentic AI era, people continue to be our most valuable resource. It’s essential to empower them with AI and equip them with the skills they need to use AI responsibly and securely. Cybersecurity awareness should go beyond designated months or campaigns; true awareness means taking meaningful action.\n\nHere are three actions you can take today to maximize your AI investments:\n\n1. **Share the [Be Cybersmart Kit](https://aka.ms/becybersmartkit) with your employees**. It includes tips for protecting yourself from fraud and deepfakes, guidance on safe AI usage, and key security best practices.\n2. **Invest in people**: Focus on upskilling initiatives that support your AI transformation, cloud modernization, and security-first strategies.\n3. **Champion a security-first culture**: Ensure cybersecurity is integral to every business discussion and woven into your overall strategy.\n\n## Microsoft guide for securing the AI-powered enterprise\n\n[Download the guide](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/emerging-trends/ai-security-guide)\n\n![A close up of a colorful swirl](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-24-102029.webp)",
