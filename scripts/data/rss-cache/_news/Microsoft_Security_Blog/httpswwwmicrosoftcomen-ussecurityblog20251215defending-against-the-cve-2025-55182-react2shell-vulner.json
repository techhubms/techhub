  "EnhancedContent": "CVE-2025-55182 (also referred to as React2Shell and includes CVE-2025-66478, which was merged into it) is a critical pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting React Server Components, Next.js, and related frameworks. With a CVSS score of 10.0, this vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers through a single malicious HTTP request.\n\nExploitation activity related to this vulnerability was detected as early as December 5, 2025. Most successful exploits originated from red team assessments; however, we also observed real-world exploitation attempts by threat actors delivering multiple subsequent payloads, majority of which are coin miners. Both Windows and Linux environments have been observed to be impacted.\n\nThe React Server Components ecosystem is a collection of packages, frameworks, and bundlers that enable React 19 applications to run parts of their logic on the server rather than the browser. It uses the Flight protocol to communicate between client and server. When a client requests data, the server receives a payload, parses this payload, executes server-side logic, and returns a serialized component tree. The vulnerability exists because affected React Server Components versions fail to validate incoming payloads. This could allow attackers to inject malicious structures that React accepts as valid, leading to prototype pollution and remote code execution.\n\nThis vulnerability presents a significant risk because of the following factors:\n\n- Default configurations are vulnerable, requiring no special setup or developer error.\n- Public proof-of-concept exploits are readily available with near-100% reliability.\n- Exploitation can happen without any user authentication since this is a pre-authentication vulnerability.\n- The vulnerability could be exploited using a single malicious HTTP request.\n\nIn this report, Microsoft Defender researchers share insights from observed attacker activity exploiting this vulnerability. Detailed analyses, detection insights, as well as mitigation recommendations and hunting guidance are covered in the next sections. Further investigation towards providing stronger protection measures is in progress, and this report will be updated when more information becomes available.\n\n## Analyzing CVE-2025-55182 exploitation activity\n\nReact is widely adopted in enterprise environments. In Microsoft Defender telemetry, we see tens of thousands of distinct devices across several thousand organizations running some React or React-based applications. Some of the vulnerable applications are deployed inside containers, and the impact on the underlying host is dependent on the security configurations of the container.\n\nWe identified several hundred machines across a diverse set of organizations compromised using common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed with web application RCE. To exploit CVE-2025-55182, an attacker sends a crafted input to a web application running React Server Components functions in the form of a POST request. This input is then processed as a serialized object and passed to the backend server, where it is deserialized. Due to the default trust among the components, the attacker-provided input is then deserialized and the backend runs attacker-provided code under the NodeJS runtime.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Figure1-attack-chain.webp)Figure 1: Attack diagram depicting activity leading to action on objectives\n\nPost-exploitation, attackers were observed to run arbitrary commands, such as reverse shells to known Cobalt Strike servers. To achieve persistence, attackers added new malicious users, utilized remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools such as MeshAgent, modified *authorized\\_keys* file, and enabled root login. To evade security defenses, the attackers downloaded from attacker-controlled CloudFlare Tunnel endpoints (for example, *\\*.trycloudflare.com*) and used [bind mounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/013/) to hide malicious processes and artifacts from system monitoring tools.\n\nThe malware payloads seen in campaigns investigated by Microsoft Defender vary from remote access trojans (RATs) like VShell and EtherRAT, the SNOWLIGHT memory-based malware downloader that enabled attackers to deploy more payloads to target environments, ShadowPAD, and XMRig cryptominers. The attacks proceeded by enumerating system details and environment variables to enable lateral movement and credential theft.\n\nCredentials that were observed to be targeted included Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) endpoints for Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Tencent Cloud to acquire identity tokens, which could be used to move laterally to other cloud resources. Attackers also deployed secret discovery tools such as TruffleHog and Gitleaks, along with custom scripts to extract several different secrets. Attempts to harvest AI and cloud-native credentials, such as OpenAI API keys, Databricks tokens, and Kubernetes service‑account credentials were also observed. Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) (az) and Azure Developer CLI (azd) were also used to obtain tokens.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Figure-2.webp)Figure 2: Example of reverse shell observed in one of the campaigns\n\n## Mitigation and protection guidance\n\nMicrosoft recommends customers to act on these mitigation recommendations:\n\n**Manual identification guidance**\n\nUntil full in-product coverage is available, you can manually assess exposure on servers or containers:\n\n1. Navigate to your project directory and open the *node\\_modules* folder.\n2. Review installed packages and look for:\n- react-server-dom-webpack\n- react-server-dom-parcel\n- react-server-dom-turbopack\n- next\n3. Validate versions against the known affected range:\n- React: 19.0.0,19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0\n- Next.js: 15.0.0 – 15.0.4, 15.1.0 – 15.1.8, 15.2.0 – 15.2.5, 15.3.0 – 15.3.5, 15.4.0 – 15.4.7, 15.5.0 – 15.5.6, 16.0.0 – 16.0.6, 14.3.0-canary.77 and later canary releases\n4. If any of these packages match the affected versions, remediation is required. Prioritize internet-facing assets first, especially those identified by Defender as externally exposed.\n\n**Mitigation best practices**\n\n1. Patch immediately\n- React and Next.js have released fixes for the impacted packages. Upgrade to one of the following patched versions (or later within the same release line):\n- React: 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1\n- Next.js: 5.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7\n- Because many frameworks and bundlers rely on these packages, make sure your framework-level updates also pull in the corrected dependencies.\n2. Prioritize exposed services\n- Patch all affected systems, starting with internet-facing workloads.\n- Use Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) to surface vulnerable package inventory and to track remediation progress across your estate.\n3. Monitor for exploit activity\n- Review MDVM dashboards and Defender alerts for indicators of attempted exploitation.\n- Correlate endpoint, container, and cloud signals for higher confidence triage.\n- Invoke incident response process to address any related suspicious activity stemming from this vulnerability.\n4. Add WAF protections where appropriate\n- Apply Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF) custom rules for Application Gateway and Application Gateway for Containers to help block exploit patterns while patching is in progress. Microsoft has [published rule guidance and JSON examples](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurenetworksecurityblog/protect-against-react-rsc-cve-2025-55182-with-azure-web-application-firewall-waf/4475291) in the Azure Network Security Blog, with ongoing updates as new attack permutations are identified.\n\n**Recommended customer action checklist**\n\n- Identify affected React Server Components packages in your applications and images.\n- Upgrade to patched versions. Refer to the [React](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components) page for patching guidance.\n- Prioritize internet-facing services for emergency change windows.\n- Enable and monitor Defender alerts tied to React Server Components exploitation attempts.\n- Apply [Azure WAF custom rules](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurenetworksecurityblog/protect-against-react-rsc-cve-2025-55182-with-azure-web-application-firewall-waf/4475291) as a compensating control where feasible.\n- Use MDVM to validate coverage and confirm risk reduction post-update.\n\nCVE-2025-55182 represents a high-impact, low-friction attack path against modern React Server Components deployments. Rapid patching combined with layered Defender monitoring and WAF protections provides the strongest short-term and long-term risk reduction strategy.\n\n## Microsoft Defender XDR detections\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below.
