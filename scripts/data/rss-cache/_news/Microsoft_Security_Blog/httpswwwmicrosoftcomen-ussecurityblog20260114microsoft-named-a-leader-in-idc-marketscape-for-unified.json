  "EnhancedContent": "As organizations rapidly embrace generative and agentic AI, ensuring robust, unified governance has never been more critical. That’s why **Microsoft is honored to be named a Leader in the [2025-2026 IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Unified AI Governance Platforms](https://marketingassets.microsoft.com/gdc/gdcvb3Tx9/original)** (Vendor Assessment (#US53514825, December 2025). We believe this recognition highlights our commitment to making AI innovation safe, responsible, and enterprise-ready—so you can move fast without compromising trust or compliance.\n\n[Read the IDC MarketScape for Unified AI Governance Platforms report](https://marketingassets.microsoft.com/gdc/gdcvb3Tx9/original)\n\n![A graphic showing Microsoft's position in the Leaders section of the IDC report. ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Picture1-1009x1024.webp)**Figure 1**. IDC MarketScape vendor analysis model is designed to provide an overview of the competitive fitness of technology and suppliers in a given market. The research methodology utilizes a rigorous scoring methodology based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria that results in a single graphical illustration of each supplier’s position within a given market. The Capabilities score measures supplier product, go-to-market and business execution in the short term. The Strategy score measures alignment of supplier strategies with customer requirements in a three- to five-year timeframe. Supplier market share is represented by the size of the icons.\n\nThe urgency for a unified AI governance strategy is being driven by stricter regulatory demands, the sheer complexity of managing AI systems across multiple AI platforms and multicloud and hybrid environments, and leadership concerns for risk related to negative brand impact. Centralized, end-to-end governance platforms help organizations reduce compliance bottlenecks, lower operational risks, and turn governance into a strategic driver for responsible AI innovation. In today’s landscape, unified AI governance is not just a compliance obligation—it is critical infrastructure for trust, transparency, and sustainable business transformation.\n\nOur own approach to AI is anchored to [Microsoft’s Responsible AI standard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?msockid=04b5abc717656a530541bfde16f56b4b), backed by a dedicated Office of Responsible AI. Drawing from our internal experience in [building, securing, and governing AI systems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/responsible-ai-transparency-report/?msockid=0c8ef992b9a264ce2067ebe7b81165cd), we translate these learnings directly into our AI management tools and security platform. As a result, customers benefit from features such as transparency notes, fairness analysis, explainability tools, safety guardrails, regulatory compliance assessments, agent identity, data security, vulnerability identification, and protection against cyberthreats like prompt-injection attacks. These tools enable them to develop, secure, and govern AI that aligns with ethical principles and is built to help support compliance with regulatory requirements. By integrating these capabilities, we empower organizations to make ethical decisions and safeguard their business processes throughout the entire AI lifecycle.\n\nMicrosoft’s AI Governance capabilities aim to provide integrated and centralized control for observability, management, and security across IT, developer, and security teams, ensuring integrated governance within their existing tools. [Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/?msockid=27b7b3bc5be566bc06c9a5a05a7a679d) acts as our main control point for model development, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring, featuring a curated model catalog, machine learning oeprations, robust evaluation, and embedded content safety guardrails. [Microsoft Agent 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-agent-365?msockid=27b7b3bc5be566bc06c9a5a05a7a679d), which was not yet available at the time of the IDC publication, provides a centralized control plane for IT, helping teams confidently deploy, manage, and secure their agentic AI published through [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot?msockid=27b7b3bc5be566bc06c9a5a05a7a679d), [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio), and Microsoft Foundry.\n\nDeeply embedded security systems are integral to Microsoft’s AI governance solution. Integrations with [Microsoft Purview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-purview?msockid=27b7b3bc5be566bc06c9a5a05a7a679d) provide real-time data security, compliance, and governance tools, while [Microsoft Entra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra) provides agent identity and controls to manage agent sprawl and prevent unauthorized access to confidential resources.
