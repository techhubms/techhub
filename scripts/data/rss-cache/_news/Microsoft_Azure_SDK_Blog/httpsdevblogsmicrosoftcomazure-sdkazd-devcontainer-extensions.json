These short posts (1-minute reads, we promise) highlight features the team ships that you want to know about. No fluff, just what it is, why it matters, and how to use it.*\n\n## What’s new?\n\nThe `azd` development (dev) container feature now supports an `extensions` option. You can specify a comma-separated list of `azd` extensions in your dev container configuration, and they install automatically when the container builds.\n\nHere’s what it looks like in your `devcontainer.json` file:\n\n```json { \"features\": { \"ghcr.io/azure/azure-dev/azd:latest\": { \"extensions\": \"azd-ext-example,azd-ext-another\" } } } ```\n\nNo more “oh wait, I need to install that extension first” after spinning up your dev container.\n\n## Why it matters\n\nDev containers give you a ready-to-code environment in seconds. But if your project relies on `azd` extensions, you still had to install them manually after the container started. That’s friction – especially when onboarding new team members or switching between projects.\n\nNow your extensions are ready when the container starts. Open the dev container and run `azd up` – everything you need is already in place.\n\n## How to use it\n\n1. Open your `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`\nfile.\n2. Add (or update) the `azd`\nfeature with the `extensions` option:\n\n```json { \"features\": { \"ghcr.io/azure/azure-dev/azd:latest\": { \"extensions\": \"your-extension-name\" } } } ```\n\n1. Rebuild your dev container.\n\nThat’s it. The extensions install during container build.\n\n## Get started\n\nUpdate your dev container configuration and rebuild. To learn more about creating dev containers, see the [VS Code dev container docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container).\n\n## Feedback\n\nHave questions or ideas?
