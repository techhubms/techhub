  "EnhancedContent": "Here’s what shipped in `azd` this February! This post covers release versions [1.23.3](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases/tag/azure-dev-cli_1.23.3), [1.23.4](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases/tag/azure-dev-cli_1.23.4), [1.23.5](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases/tag/azure-dev-cli_1.23.5), and [1.23.6](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases/tag/azure-dev-cli_1.23.6).\n\nTo share your feedback and questions, join the [February release discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/discussions/6854).\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n- JMESPath query support for filtering and transforming JSON output\n- Deploy to Azure App Service deployment slots directly from `azd`\n- Automatically install `azd`\nextensions in dev containers\n- New `--subscription`\nand `--location` flags for `azd provision` and `azd up`\n- Extension version requirements with `requiredAzdVersion`\n- Remote build support for Azure Functions Flex Consumption plans\n\n>\n> **📣 We want to hear from you!**\n> > >\n> Help us shape the future of `azd`\n> by sharing your experience. We’re conducting user research to better understand how you’re using the Azure Developer CLI. [Sign up to participate](https://aka.ms/azd-user-research-signup) and make your voice heard!\n>\n\n## New features\n\n### 🔍 Query and output\n\n`azd` now supports JMESPath queries, giving you the ability to filter and transform JSON output directly in the terminal.\n\n- **JMESPath query support**: The new `--query`\nflag lets you filter and transform JSON output from any `azd` command using [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) expressions—great for scripting and automation. Query support also covers `Message` -type outputs, so filtering works consistently across all commands. For a deep dive, see our 1-min blog post: [JMESPath query support in azd](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azd-jmespath-query-support/). Thanks [@scottaddie](https://github.com/scottaddie) for the contribution! [\\[#6664\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6664) [\\[#6735\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6735)\n\n### 🚀 Deployment and infrastructure\n\nSeveral improvements streamline the deployment experience, from deployment slot support to more flexible provisioning workflows.\n\n- **App Service deployment slot support**: `azd`\nnow deploys directly to Azure App Service deployment slots without extra scripts. For details, see our 1-min blog post: [Deploy to App Service slots with azd](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azd-app-service-slot/). [\\[#6627\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6627)\n- **Subscription and location flags**: New `--subscription`\nand `--location` flags for `azd provision` and `azd up` allow overriding defaults per command without changing global or environment configuration. [\\[#6777\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6777)\n- **Remote build for Functions Flex Consumption**: New `remoteBuild`\nconfiguration option enables remote builds when deploying to Azure Functions Flex Consumption plans, avoiding local build requirements. [\\[#6748\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6748)\n\n### 🔌 Extensions\n\n- **Required azd version for extensions**: Extensions can now specify a `requiredAzdVersion`\nfield, ensuring users run a compatible version of `azd` before the extension loads. [\\[#6747\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6747)\n\n### 🐳 Dev containers\n\n- **Automatically install extensions in dev containers**: The `azd`\ndev container feature now supports an `extensions` option, so you can specify `azd` extensions to install automatically when a dev container is built. For details, see our 1-min blog post: [Automatically install azd extensions in dev containers](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azd-devcontainer-extensions/). Thanks [@stuartleeks](https://github.com/stuartleeks) for the contribution! [\\[#6460\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6460)\n\n### 🤖 AI and automation\n\n- **AI coding agent auto-detection**: `azd`\nnow detects when it’s running inside an AI coding agent and skips interactive prompts automatically, so automated workflows don’t hang. [\\[#6633\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6633)\n\n## 🪲 Bugs fixed\n\n### CLI and terminal\n\n- Fixed arrow keys displaying as escape sequences in the Ghostty terminal emulator. [\\[#6739\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6739)\n- Fixed missing configuration keys not appearing in `azd config options`\n. [\\[#6619\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6619)\n\n### Deployment and infrastructure\n\n- Fixed remote build returning 404 errors when Azure Container Registry is in a different resource group than the target resource. [\\[#6766\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6766)\n- Fixed subscription cache being overwritten when switching between subscriptions. [\\[#6770\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6770)\n- Fixed `azd init`\nto fail fast when required values are missing in non-interactive mode. [\\[#6779\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6779)\n\n### Extensions and configuration\n\n- Fixed duplicate `azd-service-name`\ntag error during provisioning. [\\[#6674\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6674)\n- Fixed extension namespace conflicts when multiple extensions define overlapping namespaces. [\\[#6671\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6671)\n- Fixed environment variable substitution for array and object Bicep parameter types. [\\[#6694\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6694)\n- Fixed `azd env config set`\nto support non-string types (numbers, booleans). [\\[#6789\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6789)\n- Fixed telemetry event bundling issues. [\\[#6698\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6698)\n\n## Other changes\n\n- Improved provisioning error messages with more actionable guidance. [\\[#6690\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6690)\n- Improved error messages when provisioning fails due to region SKU unavailability, including suggestions for alternative regions. [\\[#6771\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6771)\n- Improved error classification for better telemetry and troubleshooting. [\\[#6803\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6803)\n- Improved delegated authentication messaging during interactive login flows. Thanks [@scottaddie](https://github.com/scottaddie) for the contribution! [\\[#6808\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6808)\n- Added soft-delete conflict detection hints when resource creation fails due to previously deleted resources. [\\[#6810\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6810)\n- Refactored container helper for improved maintainability. [\\[#6649\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6649)\n\n## New docs\n\nThe Azure Developer CLI documentation continues to expand:\n\n- **Layered provisioning** (February 12): New guide covering layered provisioning patterns for managing shared and environment-specific infrastructure in `azd`\nprojects.
