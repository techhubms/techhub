  "EnhancedContent": "We’re excited to announce improved Python support for the [Azure Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://aka.ms/azmcp)! Python developers can now install and run Azure MCP Server directly from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/msmcp-azure/) using familiar tools like `uvx` and `pip` . Whether you’re building agentic workflows, automating Azure resources, or experimenting with AI-powered development, getting started with Azure MCP Server in Python has never been easier.\n\n## Why Python support matters\n\nPython is one of the most popular languages in the AI and data science ecosystem. Many developers building AI agents, automation scripts, and intelligent applications rely on Python as their primary language. Until now, using the Azure MCP Server required either Node.js (npm/npx) or .NET (dnx) as a runtime. With the new PyPI package, Python developers can stay in their preferred ecosystem while getting full access to the Azure MCP Server’s 40+ Azure service integrations.\n\n## Get started with Python\n\n### Run directly with uvx (recommended)\n\nThe fastest way to get started is with [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), which runs the Azure MCP Server without requiring a permanent installation:\n\n```bash uvx --from msmcp-azure azmcp server start ```\n\nThis command downloads and runs the latest version on demand, so you always get the newest features and fixes.\n\n### Install with pip\n\nFor integration into an existing Python project or virtual environment:\n\n```bash pip install msmcp-azure ```\n\nYou can also pin a specific version:\n\n```bash pip install msmcp-azure==<version> ```\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for `uvx`\ncommands\n- Python 3.10+ for `pip`\ninstallation\n\n## Configure your MCP client for Python\n\nOnce installed, configure your IDE or MCP client to use the Python-based server. Add the following to your `mcp.json` :\n\n```json { \"mcpServers\": { \"azure-mcp-server\": { \"command\": \"uvx\", \"args\": [ \"--from\", \"msmcp-azure\", \"azmcp\", \"server\", \"start\" ] } } } ```\n\nThis configuration works across Visual Studio (VS) Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Eclipse, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any other MCP-compatible client. For IDE-specific file locations, see the [Azure MCP Server documentation](https://aka.ms/azmcp/docs).\n\n>\n> **Note:** Remember to authenticate to Azure before running the server. See the [Authentication guide](https://github.com/microsoft/mcp/blob/main/docs/Authentication.md) for details.\n>\n\n## When to use uvx vs. pip\n\n| Method | Best for | | --- | --- | | **uvx** (recommended) | Running on demand without installation. Always gets the latest version. Ideal for MCP server usage. | | **pip** | Installing into an existing virtual environment or Python project. Best for integration scenarios. |\n\n## Use the GitHub Copilot SDK with Python\n\nThe new Python package also works seamlessly with the [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk). Here’s a quick example of how to configure an agentic session with Azure MCP tools:\n\n```python import asyncio from copilot import CopilotClient\n\nasync def main(): client = CopilotClient() await client.start()\n\nsession = await client.create_session( session_config={ \"mcp_servers\": { \"azure-mcp\": { \"command\": \"uvx\", \"args\": [\"--from\", \"msmcp-azure\", \"azmcp\", \"server\", \"start\"], \"tools\": [\"*\"] } } } )\n\nresponse = await session.send_message( \"List my Azure Storage containers\" ) print(response.text)\n\nawait client.stop()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(main()) ```\n\n## What you can do with Azure MCP Server\n\nWith this update, Python developers have the same access as Node.js and .NET users to the full set of Azure MCP Server capabilities, including:\n\n- **40+ Azure services**—from Microsoft Foundry and AI Search to Cosmos DB, Storage, Key Vault, and more\n- **IDE integrations**—VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Eclipse, and beyond\n- **Flexible server modes**—`namespace`\n(default), `all` , or `single` tool modes\n- **Read-only mode**—prevent write operations for safer exploration\n- **Docker support**—run as a container in CI/CD pipelines\n\nTry prompts like:\n\n- “List my Azure Storage containers”\n- “Show me my Cosmos DB databases”\n- “What indexes do I have in my Azure AI Search service?”\n- “Generate Azure CLI commands to create a new resource group”\n\n## Get started today\n\n- **PyPI Package:** [msmcp-azure](https://pypi.org/project/msmcp-azure/)\n- **GitHub Repo:** [aka.ms/azmcp](https://aka.ms/azmcp)\n- **Documentation:** [aka.ms/azmcp/docs](https://aka.ms/azmcp/docs)\n- **VS Code Extension:** [aka.ms/azmcp/download/vscode](https://aka.ms/azmcp/download/vscode)\n- **Create an Issue:** [aka.ms/azmcp/issues](https://aka.ms/azmcp/issues)\n\n## Summary\n\nAzure MCP Server now has first-class Python support via PyPI. Install with `uvx` or `pip` and connect your AI agents to over 40 Azure services in seconds. Whether you’re building in VS Code, running in a CI pipeline, or scripting automation, the Python package gives you a native, lightweight path to agentic Azure development.
