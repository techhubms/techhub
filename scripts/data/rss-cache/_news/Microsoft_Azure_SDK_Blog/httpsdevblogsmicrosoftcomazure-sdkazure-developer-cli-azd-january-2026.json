[\\[#6390\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6390)\n- **Environment-specific configuration**: New `azd env config`\ncommands enable environment-specific configuration management, allowing you to set different configurations for different environments (dev, staging, production, etc.). [\\[#6348\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6348)\n- **Enhanced environment management**: New `azd env remove`\ncommand allows deleting local environment configuration files cleanly. [\\[#6511\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6511)\n\n### 🔐 Authentication and security\n\n- **Cross-tenant authentication**: Added support for cross-tenant authentication when using remote environment state in Azure Blob Storage, enabling more flexible multitenant scenarios. [\\[#6441\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6441)\n- **Authentication status**: New `azd auth status`\ncommand displays current authentication status, making it easier to verify credentials and troubleshoot authentication issues. [\\[#6377\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6377)\n\n### 🚀 Performance and infrastructure\n\n- **File-based caching**: Added file-based caching to `azd show`\nfor approximately 60x performance improvement, dramatically speeding up resource inspection operations. [\\[#6418\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6418)\n- **Podman support**: Added Podman support as fallback container runtime when Docker is unavailable, providing more flexibility in containerized environments. [\\[#6436\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6436)\n- **Infrastructure provider auto-detection**: Automatically detects infrastructure provider (Bicep/Terraform) from infra directory files when not explicitly specified, streamlining project setup. [\\[#6461\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6461)\n\n### ✨ Developer experience\n\n- **Extension update notifications**: When customers run extension commands, azd checks if a newer version is available and displays an update warning with upgrade instructions. The check runs in parallel without adding latency, using registry caching with 4-hour TTL (time to live) and a 24-hour warning cooldown per extension. [\\[#6512\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6512)\n- **Property-level change details**: Added property-level change details in `azd provision --preview`\noutput for Bicep deployments, providing more granular visibility into infrastructure changes. [\\[#6262\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6262)\n- **Non-Aspire projects support**: Added support for non-Aspire projects in Visual Studio connected services, expanding IDE integration capabilities. [\\[#5536\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5536)\n\n### 🎁 Other enhancements\n\n- **GitHub CLI update**: Updated GitHub CLI tool version to 2.86.0. [\\[#6579\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6579)\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Deprecated commands removed\n\nAs announced in previous releases, the following deprecated commands are removed:\n\n- **Login commands**: Removed deprecated `azd login`\nand `azd logout` commands in favor of `azd auth login` and `azd auth logout` . Users must update scripts and workflows to use the `azd auth` subcommands. [\\[#6395\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6395)\n\n### Azure Spring Apps\n\n- **Support discontinued**: Azure Spring Apps support is removed from `azd`\n. Projects using Azure Spring Apps need to migrate to alternative hosting solutions like Azure Container Apps or Azure App Service. [\\[#6369\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6369)\n\n## 🪲 Bugs fixed\n\n### Extension and configuration fixes\n\n- **Extension configuration properties**: Fixed extension configuration properties support by adding AdditionalProperties fields to project and service configurations. [\\[#6481\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6481)\n- **Extension command failures and update notifications**: Fixed extension commands failing after update notification is displayed, and fixed update notification cooldown being recorded even when warning isn’t shown. [\\[#6604\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6604)\n- **Extension error messages**: Improved extension error messages by including error suggestion text. [\\[#6588\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6588)\n- **Extension installation**: Fixed `azd ext install --force`\nto properly reinstall extensions when version matches. [\\[#6435\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6435)\n\n### Deployment and infrastructure\n\n- **Bicep CLI path**: Fixed Bicep CLI uninitialized path causing container app deployments to fail. [\\[#6610\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6610)\n- **Resource display names**: Fixed `azd down`\nto dynamically resolve resource display names. [\\[#6452\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6452)\n- **Deployment state handling**: Fixed `azd down`\nto handle deployment state correctly when resources are manually deleted. [\\[#6267\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6267)\n- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment schema**: Fixed AKS deployment schema to allow Helm deployments without project field. [\\[#6444\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6444)\n\n### Authentication and URL handling\n\n- **GitHub URL parsing**: Fixed GitHub URL parsing to check authentication before branch resolution. [\\[#6478\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6478)\n- **Authentication handling**: Improved authentication handling when not using built-in auth methods. [\\[#5954\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5954)\n\n### Error handling\n\n- **Configuration loading**: Fixed panic on middleware construction failure when loading invalid configuration files. [\\[#6517\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6517)\n- **Context cancellation**: Fixed context cancellation issue causing subsequent operations to fail after command steps complete. [\\[#6536\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6536)\n- **Workflow step errors**: Fixed context canceled errors in workflow steps. [\\[#6446\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6446)\n\n### Resource management\n\n- **DocumentDB resources**: Fixed Azure DocumentDB (mongoClusters) resources not being displayed in provisioning output. [\\[#6527\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6527)\n\n## Other changes\n\n- **GitHub CLI update**: Updated GitHub CLI tool version to 2.86.0. [\\[#6579\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6579)\n- **Error telemetry**: Improved error telemetry with specific error type classification. [\\[#6389\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6389)\n\n## New docs\n\nThe Azure Developer CLI documentation continues to expand with updates and improvements:\n\n- **Proxy configuration guide** (January 15): New comprehensive guide for configuring `azd`\nto work with HTTP/HTTPS proxies, including corporate proxy scenarios and troubleshooting tips. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/configure-proxy)\n- **Device code authentication FAQ** (January 26): Added guidance on device code authentication flow for scenarios where browser-based authentication isn’t available. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/faq#how-do-i-authenticate-in-codespaces-if-device-login-has-an-issue)\n- **azd publish command** (January 23): New documentation for the `azd publish`\ncommand, which separates publishing to container registries from deployment.
