Enterprises are expected to support traditional business intelligence, increasingly complex analytics, and a new generation of AI-driven workloads—often on the same data, at the same time, and with far greater expectations for speed and cost efficiency.\n\nMany organizations running Azure Synapse Analytics have already taken the important step toward cloud-based analytics. The question we hear most often now is **what comes next?** How can our organization scale performance without overprovisioning, simplify operations without creating data silos, and improve price performance as data volumes grow from several terabytes to petabytes?\n\nTo help answer this question, Microsoft enlisted Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) to do an independent technical validation comparing price-performance and cost-per-query for both Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse and Azure Synapse dedicated SQL pools across representative analytical workloads.\n\nESG has independently validated what we’ve been hearing from real-world customers: Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse delivers faster query performance and better price performance than Azure Synapse, while dramatically reducing management overhead.\n\n## Proven performance for 1TB and 10TB datasets\n\nAcross both moderate and large-scale workloads, the ESG validation demonstrated advantages for Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse compared to Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools.\n\n### 1TB dataset performance\n\n- Query processing of Fabric Data Warehouse was up to 75% faster than Azure Synapse Dedicated pools when comparing similarly priced capacity units.\n- Fabric Data Warehouse had comparable or better price-per-query than Azure Synapse Dedicated Pools across all tested configurations.\n- Fabric Data Warehouse offers similar or better price performance with significantly reduced overhead than Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools.\n\n![Bar chart comparing average runtime in minutes for 1TB dataset queries using Microsoft Fabric DW and Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools across two configurations.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1024x531.png)*Bar chart comparing average runtime in minutes for 1TB dataset queries using Microsoft Fabric DW and Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools across two configurations*\n\n### 10TB dataset performance\n\n- Query processing time of Fabric Data Warehouse was 50-90% faster than Azure Synapse Dedicated Pools at similar price points.\n- Fabric Data Warehouse’s price per-query was up to 71% better than Azure Synapse Dedicated Pools.\n- Fabric scales efficiently as data volumes grow and delivers consistent performance improvements across capacities tested.\n\n![Bar chart comparing price-performance of Microsoft Fabric DW and Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools using a 10TB data set](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22-1024x563.png)Bar chart comparing price-performance of Microsoft Fabric DW and Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools using a 10TB data set\n\nThe performance and cost advantages validated by ESG are not the result of tuning or one-off optimizations. They are a direct outcome of how Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse is [architected from the ground up](http://aka.ms/FabricDWUnderTheHood).\n\nYou can read more about the results in the published report [aka.ms/FabricDWTechnicalValidation](https://aka.ms/FabricDWTechnicalValidation)\n\n## What this means for Azure Synapse Analytics customers\n\nIf you’re running Azure Synapse today across dedicated SQL pools, Apache Spark, or data pipelines, Azure Synapse remains a stable, fully supported, and production proven platform.\n\nIf you are ready to take the next step, migrating to Fabric represents more than a lateral move. It’s an opportunity to modernize your entire analytics foundation while preserving investments you’ve already made in the Microsoft data ecosystem.\n\nTo support your migration journey, our team has developed comprehensive resources tailored to your specific Synapse workload:\n\nFor users of **dedicated SQL pools**, we’ve built a complete migration kit including a detailed [Migration Guide](http://aka.ms/SynapseToFabric), a [Migration Assistant](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/migrate-with-migration-assistant) that automates and simplifies the transition to Fabric Data Warehouse, helping you unlock OneLake’s architecture and AI-driven capabilities. We also offer documentation on [common deployment patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/analytics/architecture/fabric-deployment-patterns) to help you deploy the right architecture for your environment.\n\nFor **** users of **Spark**, we offer detailed migration resources and tools to streamline your transition to Fabric’s unified Spark experience including a [semi-automated migration script](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-migration/tree/main/data-engineering), a [manual migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/migrate-synapse-overview), and documentation to help you compare the benefits of [Fabric vs. Azure Synapse Spark](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/comparison-between-fabric-and-azure-synapse-spark). We also have some exciting announcements on a new Synapse to Fabric Spark Migration Assistant and a Fabric Assessment Tool coming at FabCon.\n\nFor users of **Azure Synapse Pipelines** users, we have [a PowerShell based migration tool,](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/migrate-pipelines-powershell-upgrade-module-for-azure-data-factory-to-fabric) automated tools available through our [partner](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/product/saas/bitwiseinc1749229781702.fulkrumcloud-adf-synapse) channels and a [Microsoft CAT open-source tool](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-toolbox/tree/main/tools/FabricDataFactoryMigrationAssistant), with more exciting updates coming at FabCon to help you transition to Fabric Data Factory’s enhanced orchestration capabilities.\n\nWe look forward to seeing many of you at [FabCon/SQLCon](http://AKA.MS/FC) from March 16-20, 2026, in Atlanta—our premier event for Microsoft Fabric. We’re offering discount code **MSCATL** for $200 off. It’s an excellent opportunity to learn directly from the product team, attend migration focused sessions, and hear first-hand from customers who have successfully made the transition",
