  "EnhancedContent": "The modern enterprise runs on data-driven decisions. And the modern data warehouse, isn’t just a system of record, it is the foundation for trusted decision-making and AI-powered innovation. With OneLake at its core, Microsoft Fabric unifies data across the enterprise, eliminating fragmentation and enabling true openness. This architecture means that Fabric Data Warehouse isn’t just a standalone service, it’s part of a connected ecosystem where data flows freely, supports diverse workloads, and is always ready for advanced analytics and AI.\n\nToday, we’re excited to share that Microsoft has been named a Leader and an Outperformer in the 2025 GigaOm Radar for Data Warehouses. GigaOm positioned Microsoft in the Innovation/Feature Play quadrant citing “Microsoft is classified as an Outperformer given its forward-looking roadmap and rapid release of new features, its significant investments in research and development, and its industry thought leadership.”\n\nThis dual recognition validates our strategy focused on architectural choices and delivery velocity—both critical in a market where innovation is the only constant.\n\nRead more about this recognition in the ‘[GigaOm Radar for Data Warehouses](https://portal.gigaom.com/reprint/gigaom-radar-for-data-warehouses-v6-microsoft)’ report.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Data-Warehouses-v6-Radar-Image-2-784x1024.webp)Image of a circle showing Microsoft in the bottom left quadrant, positioned as a leader and outperformer\n\n## The modern data warehouse for modern analytics\n\nBuilt on a lakehouse foundation, Fabric Data Warehouse is fully serverless, scales effortlessly up to petabytes of data, and is deeply integrated within the Fabric ecosystem. Together, these capabilities deliver a warehouse that is modern by design, exceptionally fast, and economical.\n\nIn the [report](https://portal.gigaom.com/reprint/gigaom-radar-for-data-warehouses-v6-microsoft), GigaOm recognized Fabric Data Warehouse for its open, real-time, and AI-ready architecture. Fabric defaults to open data formats such as Delta Lake, ensuring interoperability and minimizing vendor lock-in. It also supports near-real-time ingestion and analytics through native streaming integrations that land live data directly into OneLake and the Data Warehouse. In addition, Fabric embeds data science and machine learning directly in the warehouse, enabling model development and execution on governed data via built-in Spark and native connectors thus eliminating data movement while preserving performance and security.\n\n## Continuous innovation and what’s ahead\n\nEarning both Leader and Outperformer designations reflects Fabric’s strength today and its momentum for the future. This recognition is indicative of our ambition to deliver industry-leading experiences in Data Warehousing for our customers. Our 2026 roadmap includes Custom SQL pools for workload management, and new serverless billing options and other significant innovation for faster performance. Explore our roadmap at [aka.ms/Fabric Roadmap](https://aka.ms/fabricroadmap).\n\nIf you’re curious how Fabric DW works under the hood, we recently published documentation on what makes our architecture unique [aka.ms/FabricDWunderTheHood](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/architecture).\n\nWe’re also gathering the Fabric and SQL community at **FABCON/SQLCon 2025**, where we’ll share product roadmap updates, customer case studies, and hands-on technical sessions.

Organizations that modernize their data infrastructure now will seize the competitive advantage for the next decade. We’re committed to ensuring Fabric Data Warehouse remains the platform that makes that transformation possible.",
