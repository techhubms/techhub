Matt Shumer, CEO of HyperWrite and co-founder of OthersideAI, [published a 5,000-word essay titled “Something Big Is Happening”](https://shumer.dev/something-big-is-happening) that has now been viewed over 73 million times. In it, he compares this moment in AI to the period just before the world understood the true scale of COVID-19—that eerie window where a few people saw what was coming, but most hadn’t caught on yet.\n\nHis argument is blunt: the latest generation of AI models—GPT-5.3 Codex, Opus 4.6, and others released in early February—aren’t just better tools. They’re autonomous workers. Shumer describes watching AI systems complete his own technical tasks to a standard that meets or exceeds his own. His exact words: “I am no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job.”\n\nThat’s a striking claim from a sitting tech CEO. And it resonated, hard.\n\n## The reactions: urgency, skepticism, and everything in between\n\nThe response has been a fascinating spectrum. On one end, developers and founders are echoing Shumer’s experience—sharing their own stories of AI agents writing production code, generating data pipelines, and autonomously querying databases in ways that felt like science fiction eighteen months ago. The general sentiment: this is real, this is now, and if you’re not paying attention, you’re going to get caught off guard.\n\nOn the other end, the skeptics have been equally vocal. [Mashable captured this perspective with a piece headlined “The AI industry has a big Chicken Little problem,”](https://mashable.com/article/viral-something-big-is-coming-essay-artificial-intelligence-warning) arguing that the tech community has cried wolf so many times that another round of breathless warnings—even from a credible founder—lands with diminishing impact. Fair point. We’ve all sat through a few too many “everything changes NOW” keynotes.\n\nAnd then there’s the nuanced middle, where I think most data professionals actually live. Shumer himself landed here when he clarified his post wasn’t intended as fearmongering but as a genuine call to prepare. The disruption isn’t hypothetical anymore. The pace is the story.\n\nBut here’s the thing that struck me as someone who works on databases every day: no matter where you fall on that spectrum—believer, skeptic, or somewhere in between—there’s one reality that’s hard to argue with.\n\nAI is generating, consuming, and depending on data at an unprecedented scale. If AI is the engine, data is the fuel. And the database layer is where the rubber meets the road.\n\n## The question every data professional should be asking\n\nAI agents don’t just think. They read, write, query, and reason over data in real time. Every autonomous AI workflow—whether it’s code generation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic search, or automated decision-making—eventually bottlenecks at the database if the data platform wasn’t built for this moment.\n\nConsider what Shumer’s world requires from a data layer:\n\n- Vector and semantic search running alongside transactional queries—not in a bolted-on side system, but natively in the engine.\n- Real-time data freshness—AI agents making decisions on stale data is worse than no AI at all.\n- Enterprise-grade security and governance—because when autonomous agents are accessing your data at scale, “who can see what” becomes a much harder and much more critical question.\n- Performance at scale—not just for human analysts running a few dashboards, but for hundreds or thousands of concurrent AI-driven operations.\n\nThat’s the post-Shumer question for every data professional: Is your data platform built for a world where AI is a first-class consumer of your data?\n\n## How Microsoft SQL is built for this moment\n\nI work on the Microsoft SQL team, so I’ll be transparent about my perspective—but I also think our position is genuinely unique, and worth understanding regardless of where you land on the AI hype spectrum.\n\nWhat we’ve built is one consistent SQL engine that spans three deployment models, each optimized for different scenarios but all sharing the same T-SQL foundation, the same security model, and increasingly, the same AI-native capabilities:\n\n[SQL Server 2025](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/what-s-new-in-sql-server-2025) is for organizations that need to run on-premises, in hybrid environments, or in sovereign contexts where data can’t leave a specific boundary. It now ships with built-in vector search, similarity search, and RAG-ready capabilities—AI primitives inside the engine itself, not requiring a separate vector database. Your existing SQL Server skills and investments carry forward directly.\n\n**Azure SQL Database** is our cloud-native PaaS offering for teams building AI-powered applications at global scale. [Azure SQL Database’s Hyperscale](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tier-hyperscale) performance, built-in intelligent tuning, and the ability to serve as the transactional backbone for AI applications that need low-latency, high-concurrency access to structured data.\n\n**SQL database in Microsoft Fabric** is where things get especially interesting in the context of Shumer’s essay. It’s a fully SaaS-native SQL database that is “translytical” by design—meaning it handles real-time operational workloads and analytical workloads in a single place, with zero ETL. Data is automatically mirrored to OneLake in real time, which means your AI and machine learning workloads, your data engineering pipelines, and your Power BI reports all get fresh data without you building and maintaining a single pipeline. In Shumer’s world—where AI agents need instant access to current data—that architecture isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s foundational.\n\n## AI that helps you work with data, not replace you\n\nOne of the most important things we’re investing in is Copilot-powered SQL development. Today, you can use natural language to author, debug, and optimize T-SQL queries directly in VS Code and within the Fabric portal. This isn’t about replacing data professionals—it’s about amplifying them. The expertise to design the right schema, ask the right question, and govern the right access policies isn’t going away. If anything, in a world where AI agents are autonomously accessing data, that expertise becomes more valuable, not less.\n\nWe’re also building AI capabilities directly into the SQL engine itself:\n\n- Vector and similarity search lets you build semantic search and RAG applications without leaving your SQL environment.\n- Real-time mirroring to OneLake in Fabric means AI workloads always operate on current data.\n- Unified governance and security—row-level security, always-encrypted, Microsoft Purview integration—ensures that as AI agents scale up their data access, your security posture scales with them.\n- One T-SQL everywhere means your skills and code are portable across SQL Server, Azure SQL, and Fabric. No retraining. No re-platforming. Your investment compounds.\n\n## The balanced view: opportunity, not apocalypse\n\nI’ll be honest—I don’t think every job disappears tomorrow. The skeptics have a point that the AI industry has a pattern of over-promising on timelines. But the skeptics who dismiss the direction of change are making a different kind of mistake. The pace is accelerating. The capabilities are real. And the organizations that are building their data platforms with AI as a first-class citizen—not an afterthought—are the ones that will be ready regardless of whether the timeline is twelve months or thirty-six.\n\nThe role of the data professional is evolving, not vanishing. We’re moving from writing queries to designing AI-ready data architectures. From managing backups to governing autonomous data access. From building dashboards to ensuring the trustworthiness and quality of the data that AI systems depend on to make real decisions.\n\nThat evolution is what we’re building for on the Microsoft SQL team. Every capability we ship—across SQL Server, Azure SQL, and SQL database in Fabric—is designed to put data professionals at the center of the AI era, not on the sidelines.\n\n## Something big IS happening. Is your data platform ready?\n\nMatt Shumer’s essay forced a conversation that the industry needed to have—even if you disagree with his framing or his timeline. The question isn’t whether AI will transform how we work with data. It’s whether your data platform is ready when it does.\n\nWe think ours is. And we’d love to show you.\n\nHere’s how to go deeper:\n\n- Join us at [SQLCon 2026 + FabCon](https://sqlcon.us/)—March 16–20 in Atlanta. Over 150 sessions on AI + SQL + Fabric, hands-on workshops, and the kind of community conversations that actually move your career forward.\n- Try [SQL database in Fabric](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-sql-database-in-fabric-is-now-generally-available-ga/)—it’s GA now and you can get started today.\n- Read our [2025 Year in Review](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/2025-year-in-review-whats-new-across-sql-server-azure-sql-and-sql-database-in-fabric) to see the full scope of what we shipped last year across the SQL family.\n\nSomething big is happening. Let’s build for it—together."
