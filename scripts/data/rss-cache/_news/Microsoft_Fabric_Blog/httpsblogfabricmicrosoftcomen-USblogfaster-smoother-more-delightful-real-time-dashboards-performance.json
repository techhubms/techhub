We have released a set of improvements, all aiming to make Real-Time Dashboards faster, smoother, and more responsive, based directly on what our customers and community told us.\n\nWe listen to your feedback and take action!\n\n## What’s Improved\n\nThanks to a series of performance optimizations across the dashboard experience, we’ve achieved a significant double‑digit reduction in full dashboard load time, along with major improvements in common interactions:\n\n- **Much faster initial dashboard load**—in some scenarios, up to **6× faster**\n- **Large dataset visualizations load dramatically quicker**, reducing wait time and friction\n- **Charts render more efficiently** (including up to **10× faster** pie charts)\n- **Smoother, more responsive UI**, with freezes and visual jumps eliminated\n\nThese gains add up to a noticeably snappier experience—especially when working with live, high‑volume data.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nPerformance isn’t just about benchmarks—it’s about flow, confidence, and trust. Faster dashboards mean:\n\n- Quicker insights from live data\n- Less interruption when exploring or refreshing tiles\n- A more polished, reliable experience you can depend on\n\n## Try it Yourself\n\nThe best way to feel the difference is to experience it firsthand.\n\n**[Get started with the Real-Time Dashboards quick start](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create?tabs=create-manual%2Ckql-database)**\n\nSpin up your first Real-Time Dashboard in minutes and see how fast live data exploration can be.\n\nAs always, keep the feedback coming—we’re listening.",
