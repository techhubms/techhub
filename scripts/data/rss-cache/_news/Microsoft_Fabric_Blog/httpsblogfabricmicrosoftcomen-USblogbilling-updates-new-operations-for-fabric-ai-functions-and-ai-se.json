  "EnhancedContent": "We’re introducing billing reporting updates that make it easier to track AI-related usage in Microsoft Fabric.\n\n## New AI Functions operation\n\nUntil now, Fabric AI functions usage was reported under other operations, such as [Spark-related operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/fabric-operations#spark), or [Dataflows Gen2-related operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/fabric-operations#dataflows-gen2), depending on where the functions were used.\n\nTo provide more transparency, Fabric AI functions will have a dedicated operation called **AI Functions**, which will enable you to see their consumption clearly, whether you call them from a Notebook or other Fabric items, such as Dataflows Gen2.\n\nThis operation will also include Azure OpenAI Service calls [with REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/ai-services/how-to-use-openai-via-rest-api), [Python SDK, and Synapse ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/ai-services/how-to-use-openai-sdk-synapse).\n\n## New AI Services operation\n\nWithin [Azure AI Services in Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/ai-services/ai-services-overview) (previously named Azure Cognitive Services), Text Analytics and Azure AI Translator will have a dedicated operation called **AI Services**.\n\n## Billing and rollout details\n\nBoth operations will be billed under the **Copilot and AI Capacity Usage CU** billing meter. Starting March 17, 2025, you’ll begin seeing these operations reflected in your Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app.\n\nThe following table outlines how the new operations map to Fabric items and Azure billing meter:\n\n| **Operation** | **Description** | **Item** | **Azure billing meter** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | AI Functions | Compute cost associated with using Fabric AI functions and Azure OpenAI Service | Notebook | Copilot and AI Capacity Usage CU | | AI Functions | Compute cost associated with using Fabric AI functions | Dataflow Gen2 | Copilot and AI Capacity Usage CU | | AI Services | Compute cost associated with using Azure AI Services in Fabric (Text Analytics and Azure AI Translator) | Notebook | Copilot and AI Capacity Usage CU |\n\nThese updates separate Fabric AI functions and Azure AI Services consumption from your broader Spark workloads and other Fabric item workloads, making AI costs easier to understand, allocate, and manage.\n\n**These are reporting changes only; the underlying consumption rates are unchanged.**\n\n## Next steps\n\nFor the complete, up-to-date list of Microsoft Fabric operations and billing meters, refer to the [Fabric operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/fabric-operations) documentation.\n\nTo learn more about AI functions, visit the [AI functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/ai-functions/overview) documentation.\n\nBased on your feedback, these updates are designed to make AI Functions consumption clearer and easier to understand. If you have any additional feedback, please feel free to post on [Fabric ideas](https://aka.ms/FabricBlog/ideas).",
