[Input sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-manage-eventstream-sources?pivots=enhanced-capabilities#supported-sources)\n2. [Streams](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/create-default-derived-streams#concepts) (default and derived)\n3. Operators (using [No-Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/process-events-using-event-processor-editor?pivots=enhanced-capabilities#transform-event-data-by-using-operators) or [SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/process-events-using-sql-code-editor))\n4. [Destinations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-manage-eventstream-destinations?pivots=enhanced-capabilities#supported-destinations)\n\nEach component maps to one or more of the four Eventstream [operation types](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/monitor-capacity-consumption#operation-types) (billing meters). These operation types define how Eventstream activity is represented in the [Fabric Capacity Metrics app](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app) and how they contribute to Fabric consumption.\n\nThe following reference table outlines how Eventstream components correspond to each operation type. Note that certain components may map to one or more operation types:\n\n| **Eventstream Component** | **Operation Type** | **Description of Operation Type** | **Operation unit of measure** | **Fabric consumption rate** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | **Eventstream Per Hour** | Flat charge | Per hour | 0.222 capacity unit (CU) hours | | Streams (default and derived) | **Eventstream Data Traffic Per GB** | Data ingress and egress volume in default and derived streams<br>(includes 24-hour retention) | Per gigabyte | 0.342 CU hours | | Operators and some input sources | **Eventstream Processor Per Hour** | Computing resources that the processor consumes | Per hour | Starts at 0.778 CU hours and autoscales 2 per throughput | | Input sources leveraging connector | **Eventstream Connectors Per vCore Hour** | Computing resources that the connectors consume | Per hour | 0.611 CU hours per vCore |\n\nTable listing Eventstream pricing components with their operation types, descriptions, units, and consumption rates, including hourly charges, data traffic per GB, processor usage, and connector vCore costs.\n\n### Breakdown of each component with associated operation type:\n\n![Flow diagram: Input Source → Default Stream → Operator → Derived Stream → Destination.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-12.png) Flow diagram: Input Source → Default Stream → Operator → Derived Stream → Destination.\n\n### Input Source\n\nInput source(s) represents where your data comes from in an Eventstream. You can connect to different types of sources, and pricing is based on how they operate.\n\nMost Eventstream sources fall under ‘connectors’, meaning they incur the cost of [Connector vCore per hour meter](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/monitor-capacity-consumption#Note-3) (e.g., Azure SQL DB, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, etc.).\n\nOther sources do not incur the connector cost and instead incur the [Eventstream Processor Per Hour meter](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/monitor-capacity-consumption#Note-2) charge (e.g. [Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-source-azure-event-hubs?pivots=enhanced-capabilities), [Azure IoT Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-source-azure-iot-hub?pivots=enhanced-capabilities)).\n\nBilling is determined by how each source brings data into Fabric.\n\n### Default and Derived Streams\n\nThere are two types of streams in an Eventstream topology. [Default Stream](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/create-default-derived-streams#create-a-default-stream) is present in all Eventstreams, and additionally, you can create a [Derived Stream](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/create-default-derived-streams#create-a-derived-stream).\n\nA derived stream refers to a logical stream of data which is created by applying transformations to the default stream after adding operators such as filtering and aggregations. Derived streams can be accessed independently from default streams for additional consumption or analysis through the Real-Time Hub.\n\nFor billing purposes, the [Eventstream Data Traffic per GB](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/monitor-capacity-consumption#operation-types) meter is calculated based on the volume of data entering (ingress) and exiting (egress) each stream within your Eventstream topology, as illustrated below:\n\n![Flow diagram with two branches: Input Source → Default Stream → Transform Operator → Destination; and Input Source → Default Stream → Filter Operator → Derived Stream → Destination. Shows ingress/egress labels and data sizes (1 GB, 1 MB).](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-13.png)Flow diagram with two branches: Input Source → Default Stream → Transform Operator → Destination; and Input Source → Default Stream → Filter Operator → Derived Stream → Destination. Shows ingress/egress labels and data sizes (1 GB, 1 MB).\n\n### Operators\n\nOperators (configured through no-code options or SQL) enable the application of processing logic within your Eventstream, including filtering, enrichment, and routing. Billing is determined by the number of processing routes defined in the Eventstream, representing the paths through which data flows from sources, through processing steps, to their respective outputs:\n\n![Flow diagram with three processing routes from Default Stream: Processing route 1: Filter → Manage Fields → Destination 1 (push), Processing route 2: Filter → Derived Stream, Processing route 3: Aggregate → Destination 3 (push).](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-16.png)Flow diagram with three processing routes from Default Stream: Processing route 1: Filter → Manage Fields → Destination 1 (push), Processing route 2: Filter → Derived Stream, Processing route 3: Aggregate → Destination 3 (push).\n\nThe [Eventstream Processor Per Hour meter](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/monitor-capacity-consumption#Note-2) is determined by the number of processing routes defined within your Eventstream.\n\nSeparately, the [throughput setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/configure-settings#event-throughput-setting) serves as a lever to manage how the system scales. Eventstream automatically adjusts compute resources to maintain low latency, and billing reflects the compute that is actually consumed. By configuring throughput, you establish an upper limit on system scaling, which can also support cost management.\n\n### Destinations\n\nIn Fabric Eventstreams, destinations fall into two categories:\n\n- Push destinations perform processing and send data, they are charged per the [Eventstream Processor Per Hour meter](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/monitor-capacity-consumption#Note-2), these include:\n- Lakehouse\n- Eventhouse (with transformation applied)\n- Activator\n\n- Pull destinations fetch data from your Eventstream (rather than Eventstream pushing the data), these destinations do not incur a processing cost on the Eventstream side, these include:\n- Eventhouse (Direct ingestion)\n- Custom endpoint\n\n## Pricing Walkthrough: Example Scenarios\n\nWe will now examine several examples to calculate CU consumption based on the Eventstream components involved.\n\n### Example 1: Custom endpoint to Eventhouse (direct ingestion, no processing)\n\n![Flow diagram: Source (Custom endpoint) → Default Stream → Destination (Eventhouse Direct Ingestion), with ingress and egress labeled as 1 GB per day.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-17.png)Flow diagram: Source (Custom endpoint) → Default Stream → Destination (Eventhouse Direct Ingestion), with ingress and egress labeled as 1 GB per day.\n\nThe set-up:\n\n- Source: Custom endpoint\n- Destination: Eventhouse (pull: direct ingestion)\n- Data volume: 1 GB per day (or ≈ 0.04 GB per hour)\n- Processing: Passthrough\n- Eventstream uptime: Continuous, 24 hours/day\n\nFor this set-up, the meter calculation would be as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Operation in Capacity Metrics App** | **Description** | **Operation unit of measure** | **Fabric consumption rate** | **Calculation** | | Eventstream Per Hour | Flat charge | Per hour | 0.222 CU hour | 0.22 per hour | | Eventstream Data Traffic per GB | Data ingress & egress volume in default and derived streams<br>(Includes 24-hour retention) | Per GB | 0.342 CU hour | 0.08 GB (.04 GB ingress+.04 GB egress) of data X .342 = 0.03 per hour | | Eventstream Processor Per Hour | Computing resources consumed by the processor | Per hour | Starts at 0.778 CU hour and autoscale per throughput | 0 X .778 = 0 per hour | | Eventstream Connectors Per vCore Hour | Computing resources consumed by the connectors | Per hour | 0.611 CU hour per vCore | 0 X .611 = 0 per hour | | | | | **** | SUM = 0.25 CU per hour |\n\nTable showing Eventstream capacity metrics with operation types, descriptions, units, consumption rates, and example calculations for hourly charges, data traffic per GB, processor usage, and connector vCore costs, ending with a total of 0.25 CU per hour.\n\nThis Eventstream topology consumes 0.25 CU per hour.\n\nRecommended SKU for this Eventstream alone: F2 (87% unused)\n\n### Example 2: Content based routing with 1 connector source, processing logic, and 2 destinations.\n\n![Flow diagram: Source (Connector) → Default Stream → two branches: Operator 1 (Filter) → Destination 1 (push), Operator 2 (Manage Fields) → Destination 2 (push). Includes ingress 1 GB/day and egress 1 GB per branch.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-18.png)Flow diagram: Source (Connector) → Default Stream → two branches: Operator 1 (Filter) → Destination 1 (push), Operator 2 (Manage Fields) → Destination 2 (push). Includes ingress 1 GB/day and egress 1 GB per branch.\n\nThe set-up:\n\n- Source: 1 connector source (for example Azure SQL CDC)\n- Destination: 2 destinations (Eventhouse tables with pre-processing)\n- Data volume: 1 GB per day (or ≈ 0.04 GB per hour)\n- Processing: Filtering and routing data\n- Eventstream uptime: Continuous, 24 hours/day\n\nFor this set-up, the meter calculation would be as follows:\n\n| | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Operation in Capacity Metrics App** | **Description** | **Operation unit of measure** | **Fabric consumption rate** | **Calculation** | | Eventstream Per Hour | Flat charge | Per hour | 0.222 CU hour | 0.22 per hour | | Eventstream Data Traffic per GB | Data ingress & egress volume in default and derived streams<br>(Includes 24-hour retention) | Per GB | 0.342 CU hour | 0.12 GB (.04 GB ingress + (2 x .04 GB egress)) x .342 = 0.04 per hour | | Eventstream Processor Per Hour | Computing resources consumed by the processor | Per hour | Starts at 0.778 CU hour and autoscale per throughput | 2 X .77 = 1.55 per hour | | Eventstream Connectors Per vCore Hour | Computing resources consumed by the connectors | Per hour | 0.611 CU hour per vCore | 1 X .611 = 0.61 per hour | | | | | **** | SUM = 2.42 CU per hour |\n\nTable showing Eventstream capacity metrics with operation types, descriptions, units, consumption rates, and example calculations. Includes hourly charges, data traffic per GB, processor costs, connector vCore costs, and a total of 2.42 CU per hour.\n\nThis Eventstream topology consumes 2.42 CU per hour.\n\nRecommended SKU for this Eventstream alone: F4\n\n### Example 3: Aggregation processing with scaling traffic (comparing 1 GB/hour vs. 10 GB/hour).\n\nThis example shows how the same processing logic results in different processing charges based on the amount of data. As traffic increases, Eventstream scales compute, and the Eventstream Processor Per Hour cost grows accordingly.\n\nThe set-up (common across except for traffic levels):\n\n- Source: 1 connector source\n- Destination: Data Activator\n- Data volume: varies by scenario\n- Example 3A: 1 GB/hour\n- Example 3B: 10 GB/hour\n- Processing: 1 aggregation operator\n- Eventstream uptime: Continuous, 24 hours/day\n\n### Example 3A: 1 GB per hour\n\n| | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Operation in Capacity Metrics App** | **Description** | **Operation unit of measure** | **Fabric consumption rate** | **Calculation** | | Eventstream Per Hour | Flat charge | Per hour | 0.222 CU hour | 0.22 per hour | | Eventstream Data Traffic per GB | Data ingress & egress volume in default and derived streams<br>(Includes 24-hour retention) | Per GB | 0.342 CU hour | **2 GB (1 in + 1 out) × 0.342 = 0.68 per hour** | | Eventstream Processor Per Hour | Computing resources consumed by the processor | Per hour | Starts at 0.778 CU hour and autoscale per throughput | 1 × 0.778 = 0.77 CU per hour | | Eventstream Connectors Per vCore Hour | Computing resources consumed by the connectors | Per hour | 0.611 CU hour per vCore | 1 × 0.611 = 0.61 per hour | | | | | **** | SUM = 2.28 CU per hour |\n\nTable showing Eventstream capacity metrics with operation types, descriptions, units, consumption rates, and example calculations. Includes hourly Eventstream charge, data traffic per GB, processor cost, connector vCore cost, and a total of 2.28 CU per hour.\n\nRecommended SKU for Example 3A: F4\n\n### Example 3B: 10 GB per hour\n\n| | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Operation in Capacity Metrics App** | **Description** | **Operation unit of measure** | **Fabric consumption rate** | **Calculation** | | Eventstream Per Hour | Flat charge | Per hour | 0.222 CU hour | 0.22 per hour | | Eventstream Data Traffic per GB | Data ingress & egress volume in default and derived streams<br>(Includes 24-hour retention) | Per GB | 0.342 CU hour | **20 GB (10 in + 10 out) × 0.342 = 6.84 per hour** | | Eventstream Processor Per Hour | Computing resources consumed by the processor | Per hour | Starts at 0.778 CU hour and autoscale per throughput | 1 × (0.778 x 3\\*) = 2.33 CU per hour<br>\\*1 base rate (2.33 CU hours) | | Eventstream Connectors Per vCore Hour | Computing resources consumed by the connectors | Per hour | 0.611 CU hour per vCore | 1 × 0.611 = 0.61 per hour | | | | | **** | SUM = 10.00 CU per hour |\n\nTable showing Eventstream capacity metrics with operation types, descriptions, units, consumption rates, and example calculations. Includes hourly Eventstream charge, data traffic for 20 GB per hour, processor autoscale cost, connector vCore cost, and a total of 10.00 CU per hour.\n\nRecommended SKU for Example 3B: F16\n\n##  To Summarize:\n\nThe cost of operating Eventstream is determined by several factors:\n\n- Type and number of input sources\n- Type and number of destinations\n- Compute required for processing\n- Data volume (ingress and egress) from streams\n- Eventstream uptime\n\nWhile this blog post helps calculate CU consumption, we recommend running your Eventstream in a realistic, steady-state configuration for a period of time—ideally 24 hours—to observe actual consumption patterns.\n\nThe [Microsoft Fabric Capacity Estimator](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric/capacity-estimator) can also be used to assist in cost planning, as it estimates the capacity requirements of an Eventstream based on your input parameters. It is important to consider any additional Fabric workloads, such as Eventhouse, Lakehouse, or Notebooks, since all services draw from the same capacity pool.\n\n## We’d Love Your Feedback!\n\nIf you found this blog post helpful, please give it a thumbs up and share your feedback with us.\n\nQuestions?
