  "EnhancedContent": "Enterprises have never had more ways to store and analyze data. As data spreads across clouds, formats, and analytics engines, security policies tend to fragment along the same lines: each system brings its own model, its own controls, and its own blind spots. The result is a patchwork of inconsistent enforcement, duplicated effort, and higher risk. Yet in the age of AI, organizations need to move faster than ever to stay relevant.\n\n## Define once, enforce everywhere: A new security foundation\n\nIn our whitepaper, *[The future of data security is interoperability](https://aka.ms/OneLake-Security-Whitepaper)*, we make the case for a different data foundation: interoperable security that’s defined once and enforced everywhere your data is used. Using OneLake security as the lens, it walks through the core concepts and architectural choices behind centralized policy definition with distributed, engine-level enforcement, and explores how fine-grained access controls and enterprise governance fit into a multi-engine world.\n\n## Extending fine-grained access control across platforms and engines\n\nFinally, the paper paints a forward-looking view of how high-level governance policies can work in harmony with data access policies. But governance and data access is not limited to a single software vendor in today’s world. Instead, most enterprises leverage multiple competing solutions and expect the same security promises across them all. We present our view of interoperable security as the solution to this problem, giving customers the peace of mind they require without compromising on their data architecture.\n\n## Learn more\n\nYou can download the [whitepaper for free here.](https://aka.ms/OneLake-Security-Whitepaper)\n\nOr, learn more about [OneLake security in our documentation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/security/get-started-onelake-security)",
