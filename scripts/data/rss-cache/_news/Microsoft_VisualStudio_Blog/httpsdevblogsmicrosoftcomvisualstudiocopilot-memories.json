It’s all too easy for best practices and those tiny but critical team details to slip through the cracks, resulting in inconsistencies, confusion, and wasted time. But now, there’s a smarter way to ensure everyone’s always on the same page!\n\n## How Copilot memories make teamwork effortless\n\nIntroducing Copilot memories, a new feature that empowers every developer and team to capture, remember, and share their coding preferences and important project guidelines, automatically!\n\n### Intelligent detection just for you and your team\n\nCopilot memories continuously learns how you and your team likes to work. It intelligently detects unique preferences within your projects as you prompt. No more manual reminders or digging through old messages. Copilot keeps track of what matters most, so you don’t have to.\n\n### Confirmation nudges you can trust\n\nWorried about Copilot making changes without you knowing? Don’t be! Whenever Copilot is ready to save a new memory or update an existing one, you’ll receive a clear confirmation nudge. You’re always in control. Simply review, accept, or adjust as needed before preferences are updated.\n\n### Smart categorization, right where you need it\n\nCopilot memories doesn’t just remember information. It also helps you organize it exactly where you expect to find it. Each memory gives you the option to save preferences in your personal user preference file %USERPROFILE%/copilot-instructions.md or in the version-controlled repo-level instructions in the /.github/copilot-instructions.md. Copilot intelligently merges the results into your existing files or creates new ones.\n\n### Benefits for every developer and team\n\nWith Copilot memories, your projects automatically become more consistent and easier to onboard to. New team members can instantly see “how we do things here,” and seasoned pros save time by letting Copilot handle the details. It’s project-aware and makes documentation part of your natural workflow.\n\n## Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!
