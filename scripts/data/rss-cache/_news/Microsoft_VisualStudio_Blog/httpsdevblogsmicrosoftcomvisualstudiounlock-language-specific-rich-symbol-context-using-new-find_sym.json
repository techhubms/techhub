In large codebases, developers have relied on manual searches and incremental edits across multiple files to accomplish these tasks.\n\nModern development workflows depend on fast and accurate code navigation to avoid these pitfalls. When developers refactor existing code, explore unfamiliar areas of a large codebase, or make targeted changes, they naturally rely on IDE language service features such as Find All References, Go to Definition, and Go to Implementation to understand how code is structured and connected.\n\nAgent mode now has access to these same language-aware capabilities through the new **find\\_symbol** tool. This goes beyond traditional text or file search traditionally available in agent mode by enabling symbol-level reasoning powered by enterprise-grade language services.\n\n### [![Find symbol tool selected in VS Copilot Chat](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAncAAAJUAQMAAABNPJK5AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAARUlEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCXAbpAAAHNoBJ4AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/02/find-symbol-tool.webp)\n\n### What is find\\_symbol?\n\n**Find\\_symbol** exposes rich, language-specific symbol information to Copilot Agent Mode, allowing the agent to reason about symbols (including functions, classes, interfaces, and variables).\n\nSpecifically, this tool allows Copilot agent mode to:\n\n- View all references of a given symbol across the entire codebase\n- Understand symbol metadata such as type, declaration, implementation, and scope\n\nThe find\\_symbol tool is available today in the [latest Visual Studio 2026 Insiders version 18.4](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/insiders/). Supported languages include: C++, C#, Razor, TypeScript, and any other language for which you have a supported Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension installed.\n\nFor best results, write clear prompts and use AI models that support tool-calling. Learn more at [AI model comparison – GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison)\n\n### Example scenarios\n\nAll examples below were showcased using [bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/), an open-source C++ physics simulation engine.\n\n*Adding additional functionality to existing code*\n\nAs applications evolve, you often need to enhance existing functions without breaking current behavior. This can include adding logging or performance metrics.\n\nThese tools help the agent quickly identify all relevant references, ensuring complete and accurate updates for feature additions.\n\n[![Find symbol references found 4 references to growtable](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA10AAAMsAQMAAACVy1p4AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAbElEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVP7WsIoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAN1nLAAEZl01qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/02/find-symbol-references.webp)\n\n*API Refactoring*\n\nRefactoring an API, such as hardening it, requires deep understanding of how the API is consumed across a codebase. With symbol-level insight, the agent can discover all usages, distinguish between call paths, and propose safe refactors with minimal breakage.\n\n### [![find symbol able to find 18 references to a hash table and reoslve accesses](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA1AAAAG0AQMAAAAGn1TPAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAARElEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwJ8BtjwAAfWeAkkAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/02/find-symbol-example-2.webp)\n\n### Tell us what you think\n\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve.
