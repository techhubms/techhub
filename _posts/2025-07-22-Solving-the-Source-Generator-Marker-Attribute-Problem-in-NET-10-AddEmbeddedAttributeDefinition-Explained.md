# Solving the Source Generator 'Marker Attribute' Problem in .NET 10: AddEmbeddedAttributeDefinition() Explained

_**By Andrew Lock**_

---

## Introduction

This post examines the recent addition of the `AddEmbeddedAttributeDefinition()` API introduced in version 4.14 of the Roslyn compiler, shipping with the .NET 10 SDK. The API presents a simpler solution to handling “marker attributes” frequently employed in source generators—solving a pain point contributors have faced for years. The post covers:

- The background and existing solutions to the marker attribute problem.
- How the new API streamlines this process.
- Practical examples and recommended use cases.
- Trade-offs between the old and new approaches for source generator authors.

> _Note: This article is based on the features available in .NET 10 preview 5._

## Background: Marker Attributes in Source Generators

Incremental source generators have been present in .NET for several years, and developers often use “marker attributes” to trigger generator behaviors. For example, in `.NET 6`, the `[LoggerMessage]` attribute from the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` library can trigger code generation:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public partial class TestController {
    // Adding the attribute generates code for LogHelloWorld
    [LoggerMessage(0, LogLevel.Information, "Writing hello world response to {Person}")]
    partial void LogHelloWorld(Person person);
}
```

Similarly, Andrew Lock's `NetEscapades.EnumGenerators` package uses a `[EnumExtensions]` attribute to generate extension methods for enums:

```csharp
[EnumExtensions] // Add this to generate `ColorExtensions`
public enum Color {
    Red = 0,
    Blue = 1,
}
```

The central concern: where do these attributes originate, and how are they made available in the user's compilation without causing conflicts or warnings?

## Traditional Approach: RegisterPostInitializationOutput

A commonly-used Roslyn API, `RegisterPostInitializationOutput()`, allows attributes to be added to a user’s compilation during source generation:

```csharp
[Generator]
public class HelloWorldGenerator : IIncrementalGenerator {
    public void Initialize(IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext context) {
        context.RegisterPostInitializationOutput(i => {
            i.AddSource("MyExampleAttribute.g.cs", @"
                namespace HelloWorld {
                    internal class MyExampleAttribute: global::System.Attribute {}
                }"
            );
        });
        // ...generator implementation
    }
}
```

While this works for most scenarios, issues arise, especially when:

- The generator is used in multiple projects of a solution.
- One project references another that also uses the generator.
- `[InternalsVisibleTo]` is present in the referenced project.

In these cases, duplicate definitions of the same internal attribute may produce `CS0436` warnings due to type conflicts across assemblies. For example:

```bash
warning CS0436: The type 'MyExampleAttribute' in 'HelloWorldGenerator\MyExampleAttribute.g.cs' conflicts with the imported type 'MyExampleAttribute'...
```

## Well-Established Solution: Shared DLLs for Attributes

To circumvent these type conflicts, a typical pattern is to include shared attribute definitions in a separate DLL within a NuGet package. This way, all projects reference the same attribute type, avoiding type collision. For example:

- The `LoggerMessage` generator uses attributes found in `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions.dll`.
- `NetEscapades.EnumGenerators` includes a `NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.Attributes.dll` apart from the generator DLL itself.

This avoids generating code in every project and centralizes marker attributes:

![NuGet package contents showing both DLLs](https://github.com/andrewlock/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators/blob/main/src/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators/NetEscapades.EnumGenerators.csproj)

However, managing a separate attributes DLL introduces extra complexity in packaging and MSBuild configuration.

## Compiler’s Solution: The [Embedded] Attribute

Internally, Roslyn uses `[Embedded]` to mark compiler-generated types and attributes, ensuring they're only visible within the current compilation. This avoids the cross-assembly type conflict even when attributes are synthesized multiple times (such as supporting new features on older runtimes).

Roslyn's `EmbeddedAttribute` definition:

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis {
    internal sealed partial class EmbeddedAttribute : global::System.Attribute { }
}
```

Key constraints:

1. Must be `internal`, not public.
2. Must be `sealed` and non-static.
3. Must have a parameterless constructor (internal or public).
4. Must inherit `System.Attribute`.
5. Must allow usage on any type declaration (class, struct, interface, enum, delegate).

Until .NET 10, this compiler-internal trick wasn’t possible for libraries.

## New in .NET 10: AddEmbeddedAttributeDefinition()

With Roslyn 4.14 and .NET 10, the new `AddEmbeddedAttributeDefinition()` API lets source generators embed the correct `[Embedded]` attribute during compilation, fixing the `[InternalsVisibleTo]` leakage issue elegantly. Here’s how you use it:

```csharp
[Generator]
public class HelloWorldGenerator : IIncrementalGenerator {
    public void Initialize(IncrementalGeneratorInitializationContext context) {
        context.AddEmbeddedAttributeDefinition(); // Adds the [Embedded] definition
        context.RegisterPostInitializationOutput(i => {
            i.AddSource("MyExampleAttribute.g.cs", @"
                namespace HelloWorld {
                    [global::Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.EmbeddedAttribute]
                    internal class MyExampleAttribute: global::System.Attribute {}
                }"
            );
        });
        // ...generator implementation
    }
}
```

Using this two-line approach avoids `CS0436` warnings from duplicate type definitions. The use of the full namespace ensures correctness, even in edge cases.

## Which Approach Should You Use?

### When to Use AddEmbeddedAttributeDefinition()

- If **all consumers** are using .NET 10 SDK (Roslyn 4.14) or later.
- For **new source generators** targeting only recent SDKs, it simplifies development.
- Reduces package complexity (no need for separate attributes DLL).

**Caveats:**

- All users must have at least version 9.0.300 or .NET 10 preview 4; Visual Studio 17.14 minimum.
- Not backwards-compatible for older SDKs.

### When to Use the Shared DLL Approach

- If you support older SDKs or existing packages already use shared attribute DLLs.
- When you need to include more than just attributes (e.g., helper types, enums exposed in public APIs).
- Less risk of breaking changes for current consumers.

> Example: If your code-gen needs to expose a public enum or type (like `TransformType`), you can’t embed it with `[Embedded]` and have it usable across project boundaries; put it in the shared DLL instead.

## Summary

The new `AddEmbeddedAttributeDefinition()` API in .NET 10 is a welcome improvement for source generator authors, fixing the marker attribute leakage problem in a streamlined way—provided you can require the newest SDK for users. For backwards compatibility or packages with public types beyond simple attributes, shared DLLs remain advantageous.
