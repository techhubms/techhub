Randy Pagels explains why developers should manage AI prompts like code—using Git, code reviews, and clear documentation for continuous improvement.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Treat Your AI Prompts Like Code

**Author:** Randy Pagels  
**Posted on Oct 17, 2025**

Managing AI prompt files (such as `.prompt.md` and `copilot-instructions.md`) as part of your codebase ensures they are easily tracked, collaboratively refined, and kept in sync across your team. This approach improves both prompt quality and developer productivity.

## Why Version Control for Prompts?

- Prompts are not static; they evolve as requirements change or as the team learns what works best.
- Storing prompts in Git allows for full history and accountability—every change is tracked alongside source code.
- Reviewing prompt changes ensures consistency and quality, just like code reviews for logic changes.

## Best Practices for Prompt Management

### 1. Version Your Prompt Files

- Keep `.prompt.md` and `copilot-instructions.md` at the root of your repository.
- Treat changes to these files as seriously as you would source code—use descriptive commit messages documenting improvements or bugfixes (e.g., "Refine unit test prompt for better error handling").

### 2. Use Pull Requests for Editing Prompts

- Refine and review prompts through pull requests (PRs) to enable peer review and discussion.
- Utilize tools like Copilot Chat to summarize or assist in reviewing prompt changes (e.g., `# Summarize the changes in this .prompt.md update`).

### 3. Document the Why Behind Changes

- In PR descriptions, explain the reason for each prompt edit—such as shifting a refactoring prompt's focus from JavaScript to TypeScript.

### 4. Iterate Based on Feedback

- Encourage team discussions to review and improve prompts continuously.
- Ask Copilot or teammates to suggest refinements or flag inconsistencies. Example: `# Check this .prompt.md for clarity and duplication`

## Watch Out for Prompt Drift

- If you have multiple repositories, pro-actively align standards for prompts to prevent divergence.
- Regularly review prompt libraries for consistency.

## Key Takeaway

Prompts are a fundamental part of your software development workflow. By treating them like code—versioning, reviewing, and documenting changes—you build a reliable, evolving resource for your team.
