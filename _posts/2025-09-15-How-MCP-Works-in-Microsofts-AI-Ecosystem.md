Dellenny dives deep into Microsoft’s use of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), showing how this open standard powers AI agent integration in Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Dynamics 365, and beyond.<!--excerpt_end-->

# How MCP Works in Microsoft’s AI Ecosystem

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

MCP is an open standard (originated by Anthropic) aimed at standardizing how AI models, agents, and applications interact with external tools, memory and data sources, and APIs. Rather than custom integrations for each tool or database, MCP offers a consistent interface for these connections.

### Key Features

- **Client-server model**: AI/agent apps act as MCP clients; tools/APIs are exposed via MCP servers.
- **Standard schemas**: For tools (inputs/outputs), memory/context, and data sources.
- **Multiple transports**: HTTP, SSE, WebSocket for real-time/streaming.
- **SDKs/Libraries**: For building MCP servers or clients.

This structure enables reusable, composable tool and memory servers usable by any MCP-compliant agent.

## Microsoft’s Adoption of MCP

### Copilot Studio

- Allows connection to existing knowledge servers/APIs via MCP servers.
- Tools exposed through MCP become instantly available to AI agents.
- Security and governance features (Virtual Networks, DLP policies) are integral.

### Azure AI Foundry / Azure AI Agent Service

- Agents in Azure AI Foundry connect with MCP servers for reusable tool access across cloud-based AI solutions.

### Microsoft SDKs and Tools

- Microsoft, in partnership with Anthropic, released an official **C# SDK** for MCP.
- Frameworks like Semantic Kernel offer built-in MCP support, simplifying agent/application development.

### Dynamics 365 & Business Applications

- Dynamics 365 Sales exposes MCP servers for AI-driven CRM data interaction.
- Bridges conversational AI with enterprise business processes.

### Interoperability & Standardization

- MCP aligns with Microsoft’s "open-by-design" strategy, supporting interoperability across vendors.

## MCP Architecture & Flow

- **MCP Client/Host**: The AI model/agent app sending requests.
- **MCP Server**: Exposes tools/data sources via structured endpoints.
- **Transport Layer**: Handles communication (HTTP, SSE, WebSocket).
- **Schemas/Tool Definitions**: For client tool discovery/use.
- **Memory/Context APIs**: For persistent data and conversation history.
- **Security/Governance**: Authentication, authorization, auditing, permissions.

**Example flow:**

1. Agent receives user input (needs external data/action).
2. Discovers connected MCP server.
3. Invokes a tool via MCP.
4. MCP server processes and replies with structured output.
5. Output integrated into agent’s response.

## Benefits of Adopting MCP

- **Reusability**: Create once, use across agents.
- **Scalability/Maintenance**: Reduced custom integrations.
- **Interoperability**: Tools usable by multiple agents/vendors.
- **Faster development**: Lower integration overhead.
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI agents retain memory and data context.
- **Governance**: Policy and audit features are built in.

## Challenges & Considerations

- **Security risks** of open tool exposure.
- **Performance/latency** from external integrations.
- **Versioning/discoverability** of tools.
- **Operational overhead** for MCP server management.
- **Trust** in server safety and reliability.

## Alignment with Microsoft’s AI Strategy

- Enabling an **agentic web**: Shared tools, memory, and workflows among agents.
- Improved **multi-turn conversation/context** with persistent data sources.
- ESG compliance and governance support for enterprise adoption.
- Promoting **open standards** via partnerships (Anthropic, SDKs).
- Streamlined integration for Dynamics, Office, and other business apps.

## Practical Example

A sales agent in Copilot Studio connects to a Dynamics 365 MCP server, accessing CRM tools via MCP (e.g., listing leads or sending emails), with context (active lead or action history) maintained for user interactions.
