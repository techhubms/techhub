# Ways to Use GitHub Copilot for Documentation & Clarity

*By Randy Pagels, posted on Jun 27, 2025*

Great code isn't just about functionality—it's about clarity and maintainability. In this guide, Randy Pagels demonstrates multiple ways developers can use GitHub Copilot to simplify creating comprehensive documentation, README files, and inline comments, ultimately improving a project's readability and developer experience.

## Why Documentation and Clarity Matter

Writing clear, maintainable code helps teams onboard faster, debug efficiently, and communicate intent. Copilot provides several AI-driven options for generating documentation automatically, so developers can focus more on building and less on commenting.

### Pro Tip

Let Copilot generate docstrings, explain code, and improve readability—so you can focus on coding, not commenting!

---

## 1. Instant Docs with /doc (Fastest Method using Slash Commands)

**What it does:**

- Auto-generates documentation for a selected method or entire file using GitHub Copilot’s `/doc` feature.

**How to use it:**

1. Right-click on a method or class.
2. Select **Copilot → Generate Docs**.
3. Review the generated output, edit as needed for accuracy.

**Best for:**

- Quick, no-fuss documentation for methods, classes, or entire files. Results may need minimal edits for precision.

---

## 2. Simple Prompt for XML Docs

**What it does:**

- Produces XML-style documentation (common in .NET/C#) that details function purpose, parameters, and return values.

**Prompt example (to use in Copilot Chat):**
> "Document this function, including its purpose, parameters, and return value."

**Best for:**

- Generating structured XML docs when concise technical summaries are required.

---

## 3. Role-Based Prompt for API Documentation

**What it does:**

- Creates in-depth API documentation: request parameters, response formats, usage examples, and inline step explanations.

**Prompt example:**
> "You are a technical writer. Write detailed documentation for this API endpoint, explaining its request parameters, response format, and usage examples. Also, add inline comments explaining each step."

**Best for:**

- Documenting API endpoints with clarity, providing context for other developers and consumers.

---

## 4. Step-by-Step Breakdown (Chain-of-Thought)

**What it does:**

- Explains the logic behind a function step-by-step and inserts inline comments for readability.

**Prompt example:**
> "Explain the logic of this function step-by-step, then add inline comments for clarity."

**Best for:**

- Complex or intricate logic that benefits from clear, logical breakdowns and commentary.

---

## 5. Meta Prompting for Smarter Documentation

**What it does:**

- Uses refined, structured prompts so Copilot produces more detailed, helpful documentation with usage examples for future reference.

**Prompt example:**
> "Generate a detailed docstring for this function, including parameters, return values, and a short usage example."

**Best for:**

- Creating thorough, professional docstrings that guide future developers.

---

## Conclusion

From quick docstrings to comprehensive API docs, GitHub Copilot can automate much of the documentation process, freeing developers to focus on high-value coding tasks. By experimenting with these prompts and features, teams can ensure their codebases remain understandable and maintainable for years to come.
