# Ways to Use GitHub Copilot for Documentation & Clarity

*Posted by Randy Pagels on Jun 27, 2025*

Great code is only as valuable as its clarity and documentation. In this post, you'll learn how to harness GitHub Copilot for generating helpful docstrings, creating API documentation, breaking down complex logic, and streamlining the process of documenting code for yourself and your team.

## 1. Instant Docs with Slash Commands

- **Feature:** Generate documentation for a method or file instantly using Copilot’s `/doc` command.
- **How to use:**
  - Right-click on the method or class
  - Select Copilot → *Generate Docs*
  - Review and edit the output as needed
- **Best for:** Quick documentation; may need edits for accuracy.

## 2. XML-Style Documentation via Prompting

- **Feature:** Ask Copilot for XML-style documentation of methods/functions for clarity on function purpose, parameters, and return values.
- **Sample Prompt:**
  > "Document this function, including its purpose, parameters, and return value."
- **Best for:** Structured documentation with minimal setup.

## 3. Detailed API Docs with Role-Based Prompts

- **Feature:** Guide Copilot to create in-depth API docs, including request/response details and inline code comments.
- **Sample Prompt:**
  > "You are a technical writer. Write detailed documentation for this API endpoint, explaining its request parameters, response format, and usage examples. Also, add inline comments explaining each step."
- **Best for:** Well-documented APIs for developer use.

## 4. Step-by-Step Function Logic Explanation

- **Feature:** Copilot explains function logic step-by-step and adds inline comments for clarity.
- **Sample Prompt:**
  > "Explain the logic of this function step-by-step, then add inline comments for clarity."
- **Best for:** Understanding and explaining complex code sections.

## 5. Meta Prompting for Smarter Docs

- **Feature:** Use structured prompts guiding Copilot to create detailed docstrings with parameter info and usage examples.
- **Sample Prompt:**
  > "Generate a detailed docstring for this function, including parameters, return values, and a short usage example."
- **Best for:** Professional, reusable documentation.
