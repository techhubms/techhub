# Building Resilient Applications: Availability & Resilience Patterns in AWS and Azure

Downtime isn’t just inconvenient—it can impact customers, revenue, and reputation. Building resilient applications is essential in modern cloud deployments. Dellenny's post provides a comparative overview of critical patterns—failover, health monitoring, retries, and circuit breakers—as implemented in both AWS and Azure. This knowledge helps architects and developers design systems that gracefully handle failures and stay online.

## 1. Failover Pattern

**Definition:** Automatic redirection of traffic or services to standby systems when primary instances fail, ensuring continuity.

- **In Azure:**
  - **Traffic Manager:** DNS-level routing to the healthiest regional endpoint.
  - **Azure SQL Database:** Active geo-replication with automatic failover.
  - **Azure Load Balancer:** Zone-redundant failover support within regions.

## 2. Health Endpoint Monitoring

**Definition:** Exposing application and infrastructure health information so platforms can trigger recovery.

- **In Azure:**
  - **Azure Monitor and Application Insights:** Health checks, alerting, and analytics.
  - **Azure Front Door:** Active health probes and intelligent routing.
  - **Azure App Service:** Built-in health checks for autoscale and replacement.

## 3. Retry Pattern with Exponential Backoff

**Definition:** Mitigates transient failures by retrying after delays, progressively increasing the wait time, helping avoid system overloads during outages.

- **In Azure:**
  - **Azure SDKs:** Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff.
  - **Azure Durable Functions:** Supports activity retry policies.
  - **Azure Logic Apps:** Configurable retry and timeout policies on connectors.

## 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Definition:** Prevents continued execution of failing operations by tripping a "circuit breaker" when failures exceed a threshold.

- **In Azure:**
  - **Polly for .NET:** Implement circuit-breaking logic in code.
  - **Azure API Management:** Combine with Azure Functions/custom backoff for control.
  - **Traffic Manager:** Disable endpoints that exceed failure thresholds.

## Best Practices

- Plan for failure—resilience is not automatic.
- Adopt patterns like failover, health monitoring, retries, and circuit breakers as architecture fundamentals.
- Pair resilience patterns with proper monitoring and auto-recovery tools.
- Adapt these patterns to your solution size and business needs—start small, but build on robust principles.

By leveraging Azure’s cloud-native capabilities in conjunction with these proven patterns, you deliver better reliability, reinforce customer trust, and maintain critical service levels even in challenging conditions.
