# Automate Repetitive Code with GitHub Copilot

*Posted by Randy Pagels on Jul 04, 2025*

Stop wasting time on boilerplate and repetitive code! This guide explores how GitHub Copilot can help developers automate routine coding tasks—making your workflow faster and letting you focus on the creative aspects of programming.

## Let Copilot Handle Repetitive Patterns

Tired of typing the same function structures or loop logic? GitHub Copilot can identify what you’re trying to do and complete repetitive blocks for you. Here’s how to use it effectively:

### Steps to Automate Repetitive Code

1. **Type the Beginning:** Start with the first lines of a function, loop, or repetitive pattern.
2. **Let Copilot Suggest:** Pause and watch as Copilot predicts and fills in the remainder, often completing entire sections based on context.
3. **Use Natural Language Comments:** Guide Copilot using comments. For example:
    - **C# or JavaScript:**

      ```js
      // Generate a function to fetch user data and handle errors
      ```

    - **Python:**

      ```python
      # Generate a function to query users by role and handle missing data
      ```

4. **Apply Suggestions:** Press Tab, Ctrl + Enter (Windows/Linux), or Cmd + Enter (Mac) to accept or refine the completion.

### Example Workflow

- Instead of manually rewriting similar API fetch calls, type the first pattern and let Copilot handle the copies and adjustments for you.

## Why Use Copilot for Repetition?

- **Less Typing:** Reduces manual labor on boilerplate.
- **Fewer Mistakes:** Minimizes copy-paste errors.
- **Faster Development:** Lets you focus on unique, valuable code instead of routine repetition.

## Quick Takeaway

“The best code is the code you don’t have to write.” Let GitHub Copilot handle repetitive code so you can spend more time solving interesting problems. Try it out and share your time-saving stories!
