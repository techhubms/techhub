# The Silent Technical Debt: Why Manual Remediation Is Costing You More Than You Think

**Author: Bob Shaker**

Manual remediation of software vulnerabilities has become a significant source of technical debt for modern development teams. While technical debt has long referred to legacy code and outdated architecture, remediation debt—involving manual fixes of vulnerabilities in open source components—extracts a much larger cost from organizations.

## The True Cost of Manual Remediation

- **Remediation debt** is the cumulative burden of having to manually fix vulnerabilities in an application’s open source dependencies.
- According to ActiveState’s 2025 Vulnerability Management and Intelligent Remediation Report:
  - Each critical open source vulnerability takes developers an average of **12 engineering hours** to remediate.
  - 65% of such fixes require updating at least **five transitive dependencies** (dependencies of dependencies), often causing cascading compatibility issues and multi-day engineering efforts.
- This remediation workflow distracts developers from their core work, creating an “innovation tax.” The survey found that **20% of engineering capacity** is lost to unplanned work with vulnerability remediation as the leading factor.

## Hidden Risks and Strategic Consequences

- The direct costs in developer time are significant, but the strategic impact is even greater. Teams bounce between firefighting vulnerabilities and product innovation, leading to job dissatisfaction and talent retention issues.
- The traditional response model—detect, alert, and assign remediation—the report notes, results in a dangerous time lag for security:
  - **Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)** for critical vulnerabilities averages **98 days** with manual processes, leaving organizations exposed for months while attackers exploit new vulnerabilities within hours.

## Toward Intelligent Remediation

- The author advocates for a new direction: **intelligent remediation**—platforms and automation that not only identify issues but also build, test, and deliver patched components directly.
- By automating and integrating remediation into the DevSecOps toolchain, organizations can:
  - Eliminate much of the manual burden from developers
  - Reduce the risk window for attacks
  - Free up engineering resources for innovation
  - Improve satisfaction and retention among engineering teams

## Key Takeaways

- Manual remediation is unsustainable, costly, and slow in today’s environment.
- Intelligent remediation offers direct solutions, automating the patching workflow and supporting secure, efficient development.
- Organizations that shift away from remediation debt can better utilize their engineering talent and build security into their process from the start.
