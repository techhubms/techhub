# GitHub Copilot Premium Requests

**Author:** Rob Bos  
**Posted:** 17 Jun 2025

GitHub is introducing a major update regarding the billing structure for Copilot users: Premium Requests will now be enforced, meaning you'll need to consider the cost of the AI-powered actions you take. This change makes users more aware of resource consumption and monetary responsibility, ending a period of "free" access to significant generative AI computing.

## What are Premium Requests?

Starting June 18th, requests sent to models in GitHub Copilot other than the default GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 will count as "Premium Requests." You'll find official documentation here: [GitHub Premium Requests docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests).

Each request against these non-default models has a defined 'multiplier' cost:

- Standard requests (e.g., Chat with non-default model) = 1 premium request per turn (each question/answer)
- Using high-end models (like GPT-4.5) can incur up to 50x the premium request cost
- Cheaper models (like Gemini 2.0 Flash) incur lower multipliers (0.25x)

For a video overview, see: [Premium Requests Video](https://github-copilot.xebia.ms/detail?videoId=43)

## What Types of Actions Trigger Premium Requests?

Main features that consume Premium Requests:

- **Chatting with a non-default model:** 1 premium request per turn
- **Each step in the Coding Agent:** 1 per step (multiple steps possible per conversation)
- **Code Review in a Pull Request:** 1 premium request
- **Agent Mode in editor:** 1 premium request per user-initiated action
- **Copilot Coding Agent:** arbitrarily uses premium requests per needs
- **Copilot Spaces and Extensions:** Also consume premium requests, but the exact count can vary (unclear if it's split between local and remote extensions).

You can find specifics about these actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/understanding-and-managing-copilot-usage/understanding-and-managing-requests-in-copilot).

### Plans and Their Limits

| Plan                | Premium requests per month  | Copilot Chat in IDEs        | Code completion           |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Copilot Free        | 50                         | 50 messages                 | 2000 completions          |
| Copilot Pro         | 300                        | Unlimited (base model)      | Unlimited                 |
| Copilot Pro+        | 1500                       | Unlimited (base model)      | Unlimited                 |
| Copilot Business    | 300 per user               | Unlimited (base model)      | Unlimited                 |
| Copilot Enterprise  | 1000 per user              | Unlimited (base model)      | Unlimited                 |

- **Exceeding limits:** After exceeding your monthly allotment, excess usage costs {{CONTENT}}.04 per premium request; e.g., using a model with a 50x multiplier would cost $2.00 per request.
- **Free plans:** Even using Chat on the base model counts as a premium request.

## Controlling Your Expenditure

To safeguard against overspending, GitHub allows you to set a monthly [budget for premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-your-billing/preventing-overspending) in your user or organization settings. By default, this is set to {{CONTENT}}.00, blocking additional requests once the budget is hit. You can adjust it to your preference.

This budget setting is now surfaced within the new Coding Agent session panel as well:

## Monitoring Your Usage

Editors such as Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, and Visual Studio now show model multipliers and Copilot usage progress bars so you can track consumption in real time:

- **Model multipliers:**

- **Account overview in VS Code:**

- **Premium request usage in Visual Studio:**

To view your detailed Copilot and Premium Request consumption:

- Navigate to [User → Settings → Billing](https://github.com/settings/billing)

## Analyzing Usage as an Organization

For companies and large organizations:

- Download a CSV export of Copilot usage from Billing and Licenses → Usage in your GitHub Enterprise settings.
- Use the [GitHub Copilot Premium Requests Usage Analyzer](https://github.com/devops-actions/github-copilot-premium-reqs-usage), a single-page app (open source, built with GitHub Spark and Copilot Coding Agent), to visualize this data.

Screenshots of the analyzer in action:
