This post, authored by .NET Foundation News and Blog, introduces JSON Everything—a modular, standards-compliant .NET library that unifies various JSON technologies for modern application development.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Introduction

Working with JSON is a common task for modern .NET developers, but managing the array of different JSON standards—such as Schema validation, Patch operations, Path queries, and more—can lead to a fragmented and complex workflow. JSON Everything addresses this challenge by providing a unified, high-performance, open-source toolkit built entirely for .NET.

## Key Features

JSON Everything is a collection of modular libraries that implement a wide range of JSON-related technologies:

- **JSON Schema Validation:** Supports schema drafts 6, 7, 2019-09, and 2020-12, allowing developers to validate JSON documents with up-to-date standards.
- **JSON Patch:** Apply partial modifications to JSON structures efficiently.
- **JSON Pointer:** Navigate and reach specific elements within a JSON document easily.
- **JSON Path:** Filter and select nodes according to path expressions, similar to XPath for XML.
- **JSON Logic:** Execute conditional logic and business rules using a domain-specific language expressed in JSON.
- **Mutation and Transformation Utilities:** Modify and convert JSON data, supporting advanced workflow and data transformation scenarios.

Each module is designed for modular adoption—developers can integrate only the pieces required for their specific project, keeping dependencies minimal and maintainable.

## Use Cases

JSON Everything's unified approach is suitable for:

- Validating request payloads in web APIs
- Transforming or configuring files during deployment
- Building complex rule engines in business logic
- Empowering developer tools that interact with JSON data

## Ecosystem and Community

- **Actively Maintained:** Created and maintained by Greg Dennis, with ongoing updates and improvements.
- **Open Source:** Released under an open-source license, accepting contributions from the community.
- **Available on NuGet:** Easy installation and version management through the official NuGet package.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** The documentation site details each module, usage patterns, and integration guides.
- **GitHub Repository:** Source code, issues, and contribution guidelines are available for developers at [github.com/json-everything/json-everything](https://github.com/json-everything/json-everything).

## Getting Started

Developers interested in leveraging JSON Everything in their .NET projects can begin by:

1. Exploring the documentation at [docs.json-everything.net](https://docs.json-everything.net).
2. Installing the relevant NuGet packages.
3. Reviewing code samples and best practices from the documentation and GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

For .NET application developers working with JSON in any capacity—from validation to transformation and rules processing—JSON Everything streamlines complexity and delivers a standards-compliant, scalable JSON toolkit. Its modular design, active community, and comprehensive feature set make it a valuable addition to any modern .NET project.
