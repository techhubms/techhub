# How To Pick The Right Constructor When Using ActivatorUtilities In .NET

If you’ve worked with reflection in .NET, you’ve probably used `Activator` to create objects. With .NET 6, [`ActivatorUtilities`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.dependencyinjection.activatorutilities?view=net-6.0) was introduced to make class instantiation easier, especially for types with dependencies. Constructor dependency injection is standard in .NET, leading to many types needing constructor parameters. While `Activator` suits simple cases, `ActivatorUtilities` aligns better with today’s .NET development.

This article explores, with practical code, how to guide `ActivatorUtilities` to use a specific constructor when a type has multiple constructors.

## Registering a Type and the Dependencies

Consider the following `Person` class with three constructors:

```csharp
public class Person(string name, int age = 0) {
    public Person(string name) : this(name, 0) {
        Console.WriteLine("Person(string)");
    }

    public Person(object name) : this(name.ToString()!, 41) {
        Console.WriteLine("Person(object)");
    }

    public string Name { get; } = name;
    public int Age { get; } = age;
}
```

**Constructors:**

1. Primary constructor: takes a string `name` and optional `age`.
2. Constructor with a `string` dependency.
3. Constructor with an `object` dependency.

Now, set up a new `ServiceCollection` and register dependencies (make sure `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` NuGet package is installed):

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var collection = new ServiceCollection();
var value = "Khalid";

collection.AddTransient<Person>();           // Registers Person
collection.AddSingleton<object>(value);      // Registers object instance
collection.AddSingleton<string>(value);      // Registers string instance

var serviceProvider = collection.BuildServiceProvider();
var person = ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<Person>(serviceProvider);

Console.WriteLine($"{person.Name} is {person.Age} years old.");
```

Which constructor gets called? Given the dependencies are satisfied, let’s check the result:

```text
Khalid is 0 years old.
```

The primary constructor gets called by default.

## Choosing a Different Constructor with ActivatorUtilitiesConstructor Attribute

Want to use a different constructor? The `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` package provides the `ActivatorUtilitiesConstructorAttribute`. Apply it to your preferred constructor, for example, the one accepting `object`:

```csharp
public class Person(string name, int age = 0)
{
    public Person(string name) : this(name, 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Person(string)");
    }

    [ActivatorUtilitiesConstructor]
    public Person(object name) : this(name.ToString()!, 41)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Person(object)");
    }

    public string Name { get; } = name;
    public int Age { get; } = age;
}
```

Rerunning the previous code now outputs:

```text
Person(object)
Khalid is 41 years old.
```

You didn't change any executing logic—just decorated a constructor with an attribute. This allows you to have as many constructors as needed while specifying which one `ActivatorUtilities` will use.
