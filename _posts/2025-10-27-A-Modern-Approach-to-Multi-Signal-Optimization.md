# A Modern Approach to Multi-Signal Optimization

*By Nikhil Kurup*

Modern cloud operations face an overwhelming volume of telemetry data, often making incident response and optimization difficult. This article introduces concrete strategies for managing telemetry chaos through metric classification and correlation, leading to improved DevOps outcomes and business value.

## The Challenge: Signal Overload in Cloud Operations

Teams are inundated with a variety of signals: application throughput, pod CPU and memory usage, deployment events, and user-level latency. Treating all these signals as equally important leads to confusion and slows down both troubleshooting and automation.

Incident response time (MTTR) suffers when engineers toggle between tools like Grafana, Datadog, and raw logs, trying to find meaning in unstructured signals. This inefficiency often results in costly missteps, such as over-scaling infrastructure, which contributes to significant cloud waste.

## Building Order: The Signal Hierarchy Framework

A deliberate strategy starts with **classifying signals** into three main types:

- **Outcome Metrics:** Key business and user indicators such as p99 latency, error rates, and cost per transaction. These define what matters most to the application.
- **Primary Metrics:** External or causal signals like API request rates, deployment events, and configuration changes that drive system behavior.
- **Secondary Metrics:** Internal metrics, including pod CPU/memory, disk usage, or network I/O, which show how the infrastructure responds.

**Example:**

- A spike in p99 latency (outcome) might coincide with a recent deployment (primary) and a rise in pod CPU usage (secondary).

## Correlation in Practice: Turning Signals into Action

With a structured classification, it's possible to correlate incidents efficiently:

1. **Ingest classified signals** from Prometheus, K8s API, and CI/CD systems.
2. **Prioritize outcome metrics** to address user-facing issues first.
3. **Link primary and secondary signals** to identify root causes quickly.

*Example incident workflow:*

- p99 latency spike classified as outcome
- Deployment event from ArgoCD classified as primary
- Pod CPU high classified as secondary
- System proposes a corrective action: `kubectl rollout undo` instead of scaling up unnecessarily

Conflicting signals (e.g., high latency but no infrastructure stress) prompt deeper investigation, avoiding false conclusions.

## Proactive Metric Modeling

Applying the signal hierarchy proactively enables:

- **Faster hypothesis formation** by focusing on pre-validated, high-impact metrics
- **Prediction of imminent issues** via continuous anomaly detection in key signals
- **Cost savings** by reducing unnecessary telemetry collection and storage

*Result:* Up to 60% of production workloads can be optimized for significant cost reductions, and downtime can drop by as much as 78%.

## Business Impact

A holistic, classification-driven multi-signal optimization approach helps engineering teams:

- Cut cloud waste and monitoring costs
- Achieve faster and more accurate incident response
- Focus more on innovation than fire-fighting
- Drive measurable gains in performance, reliability, and bottom-line results

## Conclusion

The right strategy for modern cloud-native DevOps isn't just using more tools or dashboards. It's systematically creating order from chaos through metric classification and signal correlation, leading to effective automation and smarter business decisions.
