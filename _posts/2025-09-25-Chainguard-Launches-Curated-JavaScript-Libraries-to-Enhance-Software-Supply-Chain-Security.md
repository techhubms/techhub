# Chainguard Launches Curated JavaScript Libraries to Enhance Software Supply Chain Security

**Author: Mike Vizard**

Chainguard has introduced a new curated repository for JavaScript libraries, aiming to strengthen the security of software supply chains. The solution comes as a direct response to persistent threats in the open source ecosystem, such as the recent Shai-Halud NPM cyberattack.

## Key Features and Approach

- **SLSA Framework Built**: Libraries are curated and built from source using the Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) framework, originally developed by Google, which provides a set of controls for artifact provenance and reproducibility.
- **Broad Integration**: Libraries are delivered as containers or virtual machines and integrate with popular artifact managers like JFrog Artifactory and Sonatype Nexus.
- **Continuous Malware Vetting**: Chainguard continually updates and refreshes its libraries to remove newly discovered malware, striving to provide enterprise-ready, safe dependencies for JavaScript, Java, and Python applications.

## Context and Industry Implications

Open source software supply chains have faced increasing attacks, with adversaries targeting NPM repositories to inject dormant malware into widely used libraries. These threats can evade standard scanning tools, making downstream applications vulnerable in production environments.

Chainguard's service addresses the resource gap with official NPM maintainers, offering enterprises a more trusted source for JavaScript dependencies. As regulations tighten, and application insecurity continues to accelerate with the rise of AI-driven development, adopting best DevSecOps practices — such as using curated, verified dependencies — becomes more critical.

## Challenges in the Ecosystem

- **Limited Resources for Open Source Curation**: NPM and similar repositories lack the manpower and technical means for comprehensive manual vetting and curation of the vast number of libraries.
- **Advanced Malware Evasion**: Attackers increasingly embed sophisticated malware in libraries, often going undetected by standard security scanners.
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Organizations face growing accountability for vulnerabilities in their shipped software, prompting adoption of secure dependencies and DevSecOps methodologies.

## Integration and Usage

The Chainguard Libraries for JavaScript are intended for seamless integration into existing CI/CD and artifact management workflows, helping DevOps and security teams reduce exposure to supply chain risks.
