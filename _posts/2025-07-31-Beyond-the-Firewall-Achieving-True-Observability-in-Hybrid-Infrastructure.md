In this article, Gerardo Dada outlines why true observability is vital in today's hybrid infrastructures. He examines tools and practices enabling DevOps teams to monitor complex environments.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

### Author: Gerardo Dada

With hybrid infrastructure and internet-based dependencies now standard parts of IT landscapes, achieving effective observability requires going beyond simply monitoring on-premises resources. Gerardo Dada discusses how a 'true' observability approach means not just tracking what occurs within data centers or internal networks, but also understanding performance and issues across all interconnected systems, including third-party services, cloud environments, and the broader internet.

### Key Points

- **Shift to Hybrid Infrastructure:** Most organizations today use a mix of on-premises and cloud resources, making conventional monitoring insufficient.
- **Internet Dependencies:** The growing reliance on SaaS, cloud platforms, and external APIs means that performance bottlenecks or failures might occur outside organizational firewalls, requiring visibility across network boundaries.
- **Observability Tools:** Dada highlights the importance of leveraging modern observability solutions:
    - **Internet Performance Monitoring (IPM):** Tracks the performance and reliability of internet connections and dependencies.
    - **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** Captures actual user experiences from browsers or apps.
    - **Synthetic Monitoring:** Uses automated scripts to simulate user interactions and proactively detect issues.
- **DevSecOps Integration:** Advanced observability is crucial not just for reliability, but also for security and compliance across distributed infrastructures.
- **Vendor Ecosystem:** The article references leading observability vendors and platforms such as Cisco, Chronosphere, Observe, Google, Splunk, ServiceNow, Logz.io, and CodeSee, reflecting the diverse tool landscape available to modern DevOps teams.

### Practical Implications

- **Proactive Issue Detection:** With extended observability coverage, teams can spot and address issues that might be invisible to traditional monitoring, especially those occurring in transit across the internet.
- **Unified Monitoring:** A holistic approach helps break down silos, allowing IT and DevOps teams to uncover root causes and optimize end-to-end performance.
- **Security and Compliance:** Integrated observability supports DevSecOps goals by detecting anomalies and supporting incident response and regulatory requirements.

### Conclusion

Modern DevOps demands observability beyond organizational boundaries. Embracing tools and practices that monitor all aspects of hybrid and internet-dependent systems helps teams achieve greater reliability, performance, and security.
