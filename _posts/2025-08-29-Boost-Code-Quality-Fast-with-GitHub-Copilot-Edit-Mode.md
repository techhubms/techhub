# Use Edit Mode for Quick, Targeted Improvements

*Posted by Randy Pagels on Aug 29, 2025*

Sometimes you don’t need a whole new feature—you just want your existing code to be cleaner, easier to read, or follow a consistent style. That’s where **GitHub Copilot Edit Mode** makes a difference. Instead of refactoring code manually, you can highlight the section you want to improve and instruct Copilot with a comment.

## When to Use Edit Mode

- **Polish your code** by improving readability
- **Simplify complex logic** in difficult functions
- **Standardize code style** (e.g., convert callbacks to async/await)
- **Add error handling** quickly with generated try/catch blocks

## How to Use Edit Mode

1. **Highlight the code block** you want to change.
2. **Add a natural-language comment** describing your intent, e.g.:
    - `# Rewrite this function to be easier to read without changing its behavior`
    - `// Update this function to use async/await instead of promises`
    - `// Add try/catch blocks to handle potential runtime errors`
3. **Let Copilot suggest the edit**, review changes, and accept or refine as needed.

## For Larger, Consistent Updates

Use **Agent Mode** to:

- Apply the same refactoring or style rules across multiple files or services.
- Goal example: *Review all service files and update them to follow the same error-handling pattern.*
- This enables repo-wide consistency with less manual effort.

## Extra Prompt Ideas

- `# Refactor this loop into a more concise version`
- `# Add XML or JSDoc comments to describe parameters and return values`
- `# Replace deprecated methods with supported alternatives`

## Quick Takeaway

Edit Mode acts as a focused code assistant, applying your instructions to precisely selected portions—no large-scale rewrites unless you use Agent Mode. For improving code quality and reliability without slowing down, Copilot Edit Mode and Agent Mode can streamline your workflow.
