# Be Careful Using GitHub PAT With Repo Scope

Did you know that a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `repo` scope can grant more permissions than you'd expect? In this post, Home on reveals how such tokens may impact organization security and suggests best practices for handling them.

## What is a GitHub PAT?

A classic GitHub PAT is used to authenticate against GitHub as your user account. Depending on the token's scope, it can be used to read or write repository content and perform various other actions. Generating a classic PAT is done via your [developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=classic).

## Unexpected Organization Permissions with Repo Scope

During a migration from GitHub Enterprise Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud, using the [GitHub Enterprise Importer (GEI)](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer), the author discovered an unexpected permission escalation. Although their PAT only had the `repo` scope, they could still create teams at the organization level—something that should require `admin:org`.

Reviewing the PAT scope, there were no apparent admin privileges:

Assuming it was a bug, the author reached out to GitHub support, only to learn this is intentional and documented in the [scope documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes):

It turns out that some organization-level resources are, by design, accessible through the `repo` scope, even if that isn't obvious from the UI or documentation.

## Security Implications and Recommendations

This situation highlights why scope selection is critical. Relying on the `repo` scope alone could inadvertently allow modifications to organization-level settings or resources.

**Best practices:**

- Always review the [scope documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) before issuing tokens.
- Only use the least permissive scopes needed for your tooling.
- For organization resource modifications, use the `admin:org` scope explicitly, not just `repo`.
- Be aware that some GitHub API behaviors and permissions may not be obvious from the UI.

## Conclusion

As Home on describes, “Next time you give a person or tool your 'just' `repo` scope token, keep in mind that it can be used to modify organization-level resources like teams, projects, etc.” While this approach may support some integrations, it can reduce security and predictability. Using the right scopes ensures better access control.

For further security and DevOps insights, consider reviewing your existing tokens and updating permissions where necessary.
