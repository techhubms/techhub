# Can Vibe Coding Work on an Enterprise Level?

**Author:** Armelle Dawson

## Introduction

The emergence of vibe coding—where AI generates an application based on user intent with minimal manual intervention—has generated considerable debate in both developer and business communities. Armelle Dawson delves into how this approach could impact enterprise development, highlighting key advantages, security risks, and the governance frameworks necessary for success.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding enables users to describe the app or tool they need, and an AI system generates the code almost instantly. Unlike traditional development, this approach promises:

- Rapid prototyping for developers
- Empowerment of business users to create lightweight apps without deep IT involvement
- Streamlined workflows and automation of manual processes

Popularized by tech figures like Andrej Karpathy, vibe coding leverages large language models (LLMs) and advanced AI coding platforms such as Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit.

## Enterprise Risks and Security Challenges

While the potential for productivity gains is high, Armelle Dawson emphasizes several risks in enterprise contexts:

- **Code Quality & Reliability:** AI-generated code may contain unseen bugs or vulnerabilities that go undetected without rigorous review.
- **Security Risks (e.g., Slopsquatting):** Malicious code or packages (like the hypothetical 'xyz' package) could be introduced by AI, bypassing normal security checks and exposing sensitive systems to attack.
- **Lack of Traditional Oversight:** True vibe coding discourages manual code review, raising enterprise concerns.
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Business users may unintentionally introduce security or compliance issues due to a lack of deeper development expertise.

## Case Example: Vibe Coding on a Construction Site

A practical scenario involves a site supervisor creating a digital sign-in application using natural language prompts. While this could enhance efficiency, security and compliance requirements (such as verifying certifications and notifying project managers of expiries) demand well-governed, auditable AI processes and centralized data management.

## The Governance Imperative

Successful enterprise adoption of vibe coding depends on:

- **Robust AI Governance:** Clear policies on code quality, deployment approval, and risk mitigation must be in place.
- **Centralized Operations Platform:** To dissolve information silos and support auditability, enterprise AI development must be underpinned by a unified data and operations environment.
- **Ongoing Security Oversight:** Processes for dependency checking, monitoring package integrity, and ensuring regulatory compliance are essential.

## Productivity Potential vs. Gray Work

Dawson highlights survey findings showing that information silos cause significant productivity drains (“Gray Work”) in many organizations. Vibe coding could help reduce such inefficiencies—if accompanied by strong governance and centralized processes.

## Conclusion

Vibe coding introduces exciting possibilities for rapid application development and broader organizational productivity. However, its use in enterprises requires careful consideration of security, code reliability, and robust governance. With the right safeguards, AI-generated development could become a valuable asset—for both business users and technical teams.
