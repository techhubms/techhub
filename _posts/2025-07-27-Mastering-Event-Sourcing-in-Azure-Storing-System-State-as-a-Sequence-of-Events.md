# Mastering Event Sourcing in Azure: Storing System State as a Sequence of Events

Author: Dellenny

In today's cloud-native and microservices-driven environment, traditional state management approaches often fall short when it comes to auditability, scalability, and resilience. Event Sourcing—a pattern that stores every change to application state as an immutable event—addresses these concerns and can be efficiently realized with Microsoft Azure’s extensive suite of services.

## What is Event Sourcing?

Event Sourcing captures state changes as a series of events. Instead of overwriting data with each change, you record a new event (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `EmailChanged`). By replaying all events in order, the current state of the application can be reconstructed at any point in time.

**Example:**

- Rather than storing a user's current email address directly, emit a `UserRegistered` event at account creation and subsequent `EmailChanged` events as updates occur. Determining the latest email requires replaying those events.

## Why Use Event Sourcing in Azure?

Azure offers a range of cloud-native building blocks to simplify and scale event sourcing:

- **Azure Event Hubs** / **Service Bus**: Capture and stream event data between services.
- **Azure Cosmos DB** / **Blob Storage** / **Table Storage**: Persist event logs or snapshots cost-efficiently.
- **Azure Functions**: Process events, handle side effects, and update projections.
- **Azure Event Grid**: Notify other components of event occurrence.

These services work together to form a distributed, scalable event sourcing system with minimal infrastructure overhead.

## Architectural Overview

1. **Command Input**: Applications or users issue commands (e.g., `PlaceOrder`).
2. **Command Handler**: Validates, authorizes, and processes commands.
3. **Event Creation**: Commands converted into events (`OrderPlaced`).
4. **Event Store**: Events saved to a store (Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, or an append-only log).
5. **Projections (Read Models)**: Azure Functions/WebJobs consume events and maintain materialized views for querying.
6. **Query Layer**: Clients read from the projections for efficient access.

## Implementing Event Sourcing in Azure

### 1. Storing Events

Choose a storage solution that fits your scenarios:

- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Low latency, globally distributed, JSON-friendly.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Low-cost, good for archiving.
- **Azure Table Storage**: Simple and cost-effective.

Each event typically records:

```json
{
  "eventId": "guid",
  "eventType": "OrderPlaced",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-27T12:00:00Z",
  "aggregateId": "order-123",
  "data": {
    "userId": "user-456",
    "items": ["item-1", "item-2"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Event Publishing

Use **Event Hubs** or **Service Bus Topics** to broadcast events, allowing asynchronous handling and system decoupling.

### 3. Projections / Read Models

Azure Functions can subscribe to new events and update read models for fast, optimized queries. Example C# Azure Function:

```csharp
[FunctionName("OrderProjection")]
public static async Task Run(
  [CosmosDBTrigger("events", "orderEvents", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDB")] IReadOnlyList<Document> input,
  ILogger log)
{
    foreach (var doc in input) {
        var eventData = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<OrderPlacedEvent>(doc.ToString());
        // Update the Orders projection accordingly
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Event Sourcing

- **Auditability**: Every action is permanently recorded, improving traceability.
- **State Rebuild**: System state can be reconstructed from the event history.
- **Flexibility**: Build multiple read projections from the same event stream.
- **Scalability**: Serverless and managed storage scale with your needs.
- **Temporal Queries**: Analyze historical state changes for insights.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Event Versioning**: Handle evolving event schemas gracefully (e.g., `UserRegisteredV1`, `UserRegisteredV2`).
- **Replay Complexity**: Reconstructing state from many events can be slow—consider periodic snapshots.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Read models may lag behind the latest writes.
- **Log Growth**: Event logs grow indefinitely—archiving strategies are important.

## Best Practices

- Use snapshots for efficient state rebuilds.
- Always version your events explicitly.
- Capture and log event metadata (timestamps, correlation IDs).
- Apply the **CQRS** principle: separate command handling from query models.
- Monitor solution health with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
