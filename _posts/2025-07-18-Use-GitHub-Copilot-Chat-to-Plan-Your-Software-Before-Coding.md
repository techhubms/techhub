Randy Pagels discusses how developers can use GitHub Copilot Chat as a planning assistant to outline software logic and structure features before implementing any code.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Use GitHub Copilot Chat to Plan Before You Code

**Author:** Randy Pagels  
**Posted:** July 18, 2025

### Introduction

Facing a blank screen when starting a new feature or project is common for many developers. While GitHub Copilot is often leveraged for generating or completing code, it is also highly effective as a conversation partner to help plan and structure your logic even before you write the first function.

---

### ProTip: Start with a Conversation

Instead of jumping straight into implementation, engage GitHub Copilot Chat in mapping out your intended logic, edge cases, and solution structure. This added planning stage helps:

- Clarify your thought process
- Surface hidden assumptions
- Avoid later rework
- Generate better-organized codebases

**Example Prompt:**

```
Help me outline the steps to build a login flow that checks credentials, tracks failed attempts, and redirects users based on roles.
```

**Result:**
Copilot will respond with a logical breakdown, highlighting:

- Major tasks and steps
- Important edge cases (e.g., failed logins, user role checks)
- A clean structure for feature implementation

**Follow-Up Prompt:**

```
Now turn that into a JavaScript function with placeholders for the missing logic.
```

This iterative style enables you to refine your plan with Copilot’s help before you start coding in earnest.

### Benefits of This Approach

By using GitHub Copilot Chat in the planning and architectural phases, developers gain a number of benefits:

- **Improved clarity:** Helps set clear goals for the code to be written.
- **Exposure of assumptions:** Forces you to think about what you might be taking for granted.
- **Reduction of rework:** Well-structured plans lead to fewer rewrites later.
- **Better structure:** Building solutions upon solid outlines rather than ad-hoc coding.

It’s like having a reliable planning buddy ready whenever you need one.

### Quick Takeaway

GitHub Copilot is much more than a code generator. It serves as a thought partner that helps you talk through problems and build solutions around your plans. Engaging in this dialog leads to more robust and structured development.

**Discussion Prompt:**
What’s the most surprising thing GitHub Copilot helped you figure out before you started coding? Do you have a favorite planning prompt? Share it with the community to help others make the most of Copilot as a planning tool.
