# DORA 2025: AI’s Impact on DevOps — Speed, Trust, and the Platform Effect

**Author:** Alan Shimel

## Overview

The 2025 DORA Report, released by Google Cloud’s DORA research team, investigates the increasing influence of AI on software development and DevOps pipelines. Building on more than a decade of industry-shaping analysis, this report highlights how AI adoption is nearly universal across teams but brings new organizational tensions, especially around trust and stability.

## Key Insights

### 1. AI Adoption Outpaces Trust

- 90% of respondents report using AI tools in software delivery.
- Despite widespread adoption, about a third of engineers admit they don’t fully trust AI-generated code.
- This mirrors early skepticism around CI/CD adoption—usage becomes table stakes long before confidence matures.

### 2. Productivity Gains, But Stability Concerns

- DORA’s 2025 data confirms AI can significantly increase development throughput—teams using AI report faster progress.
- However, these same teams experience greater instability, indicating that workflow speed alone does not guarantee safer or more reliable releases.
- The analogy: “AI is rocket fuel. But without a guidance system, you’re just accelerating toward the cliff.”

### 3. Platforms Define AI’s Real Value

- Internal developer platforms are now present in 90% of organizations, with most having dedicated platform teams.
- High-quality platforms dramatically boost the returns of AI adoption, while weak platforms limit or even undermine those benefits.
- Mature platform engineering is now shown, with data, to be foundational for effective AI scaling.

### 4. Value Stream Management (VSM) Is Essential

- AI often drives “local optimizations” (e.g., faster code, speedier test suites).
- Without robust value stream management tying these gains to business value, overall organizational performance may not improve.
- DORA’s research underscores the need to align AI productivity wins with team and product outcomes via VSM.

### 5. User Focus as a Performance Lever

- Teams that implement AI without user-centered practices risk harming performance.
- High-impact AI deployments occur when user needs drive implementation, echoing DevOps’ core principle of business value delivery.

## What Should DevOps Leaders Do?

Shimel distills the findings into actionable recommendations:

- **Invest in strong internal platforms.** Don’t introduce AI on fragile foundations.
- **Strengthen value stream management.** Ensure that productivity improvements contribute to business goals, not just activity.
- **Define and communicate trust boundaries.** Make it clear when AI output is acceptable without review and when manual checks are required.
- **Prepare safety nets.** As development speed rises, robust rollback and recovery mechanisms become more necessary.
- **Maintain user focus.** Keep end-user requirements at the center of all AI and process improvements.

## Conclusion

Alan Shimel closes by framing the 2025 DORA findings as a call for pragmatic leadership in an AI-saturated era. While AI tools can supercharge velocity, they can only improve outcomes where strong platforms, disciplined practices, and a culture of user-centricity exist. For organizations lagging in foundational DevOps practices, AI won’t be a magic fix.

> "If you’ve got your fundamentals in place — platforms, pipelines, VSM and a relentless focus on users — AI can give you a serious edge. But if you’re hoping AI will fix broken culture or bad process, I’ve got news for you. I’ve seen this movie before, and it doesn’t end well."
