# Top 10 Copilot Tips

*Posted on Jun 27, 2025 by Randy Pagels*

Unlock Copilot's potential with these down-to-earth strategies to boost your coding workflow:

## 1. Start with a Comment

Use plain-English (or your spoken language) comments to describe what you want. For example:

```csharp
// build a function that...

# check if file exists...
```

This helps Copilot understand your context and generate more relevant code.

## 2. Prompt for Style

Let Copilot know your preferred coding style, such as:

```python
// as a one-liner
// use async/await
```

## 3. Cycle Through Suggestions

Don’t settle for Copilot’s first suggestion. Use `Alt + ]` or `Alt + [` (or `Ctrl + ]` / `Ctrl + [` on Mac) to browse alternate completions.

## 4. Be Specific

The more detail you provide, the better:

- “// sort list” is okay.
- “// sort users by signup date descending, handle empty case” is even better.

## 5. Refactor with Copilot Chat

Highlight code in VS Code and prompt Copilot Chat for rewrites, simplification, or feature additions. You can accept, reject, or tweak its changes.

## 6. Leverage Docs and Types

Copilot uses your docstrings and type hints/JSDoc for context. Keeping these updated leads to more accurate suggestions.

## 7. Quickly Write Tests

Ask Copilot to help with testing:

```python
# test for edge cases

// create tests for validation
```

Copilot suggests realistic, scenario-based tests.

## 8. Use Copilot in PRs and Code Reviews

Summarize diffs, auto-generate review comments, and get explanations for code changes directly in VS Code or on GitHub.com.

## 9. Review Everything

Copilot is helpful, but not perfect. Edit and review its suggestions—don’t trust blindly.

## 10. Share Your Pro Tips

Contribute feedback and new ideas to GitHub Copilot. The more users share real-world feedback, the better Copilot gets.

## 11. Use Workspace Context

Open related files in your workspace—Copilot reads these to offer suggestions in line with your project’s patterns and conventions.
