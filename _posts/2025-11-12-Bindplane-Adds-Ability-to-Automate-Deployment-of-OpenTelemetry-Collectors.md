# Bindplane Adds Ability to Automate Deployment of OpenTelemetry Collectors

*By Mike Vizard*

Bindplane has introduced advanced capabilities for orchestrating and automating the deployment of fleets of open source OpenTelemetry collectors. This enhancement is designed to simplify the management of large-scale telemetry collection for DevOps teams, allowing them to reuse validated telemetry pipelines and improve overall observability across distributed applications.

## Key Capabilities

- **Blueprints:** Enable reuse of validated telemetry pipelines for specific use cases, reducing redundant configuration and deployment effort.
- **Fleets:** Allow assignment of configuration files to multiple collectors, automating rollout and updates across distributed environments.
- **Automated Updates:** DevOps teams can now push version updates to all collectors in a fleet, eliminating the need for manual reconfiguration.

## Business and Technical Impact

With observability and IT monitoring converging, these new Bindplane features address the persistent challenge of efficiently instrumenting and monitoring complex, distributed environments. Blueprints and Fleets respond directly to top customer requests and are positioned to make telemetry data more accessible and actionable for IT and development teams.

The article notes that as instrumentation tools become easier and more affordable to deploy, organizations are able to collect telemetry data from a wider range of applications. However, scaling these systems still requires considerable DevOps expertise.

## Challenges and Future Directions

- **Data Silo Reconciliation:** Different IT teams often operate from separate sets of telemetry data, complicating incident response and root cause analysis.
- **AI in Observability:** Future observability platforms may incorporate large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence to further automate and streamline root cause analysis, but current focus remains on large-scale data collection and pipeline management.

## Conclusion

Bindplane’s updates represent a step forward in helping DevOps and IT operations teams tackle the scale and complexity of modern observability. By automating and standardizing collector deployment with Blueprints and Fleets, teams can focus more on deriving value from telemetry data and less on the plumbing.
