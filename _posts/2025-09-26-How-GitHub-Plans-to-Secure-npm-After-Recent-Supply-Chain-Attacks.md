# How GitHub Plans to Secure npm After Recent Supply Chain Attacks

Recent supply chain attacks, particularly the Shai-Hulud worm infiltration in September 2025, have exposed vulnerabilities in open source package registries like npm. In response, GitHub is rolling out a comprehensive set of security measures designed to protect the software ecosystem and prevent the misuse of developer credentials.

## The Shai-Hulud Worm Impact

- The attack spread via compromised maintainer accounts and post-install scripts, exfiltrating API tokens and other secrets.
- Over 500 npm packages were compromised, highlighting flaws in traditional authentication and the risks of long-lived credentials.
- GitHub reacted by removing affected packages and enhancing detection capabilities, but the incident demonstrated the need for systemic change.

## New Security Roadmap for npm

- **Mandatory Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Local publishing now requires 2FA, eliminating previous bypass methods.
- **Granular Tokens:** API publishing tokens will expire after seven days, tightening credential exposure windows.
- **Trusted Publishing:** npm and other registries will use CI/CD-based attestation, where workflows issue signed tokens to prove package origin. This replaces secret management with automation inherent to trusted pipelines.
- **Deprecation of Weak Authentication:**
  - Legacy tokens are being retired.
  - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) will be replaced by more secure FIDO/WebAuthn keys.
  - Token-based publishing is disabled by default for new packages.

## The Rise of Trusted Publishing

- First introduced with PyPI in 2023 and later adopted by RubyGems, crates.io, npm, and NuGet.
- In CI/CD pipelines (such as GitHub Actions), the identity of the workflow is verified and used to authenticate publishing events without exposing static tokens.
- This model shifts responsibility from developers managing secrets to automated workflows with provable lineage, dramatically reducing the attack surface for malware or account takeovers.

## How Maintainers Can Prepare

- **Switch to trusted publishing:** Move projects to registry-supported trusted publishing modes as soon as possible.
- **Enable 2FA across accounts and organizations:** Make it mandatory for all publishing actions.
- **Adopt hardware-based authentication:** Use WebAuthn or FIDO keys for verifiable 2FA.
- **Regularly audit and prune credentials:** Remove unused tokens from all repositories and build environments.

## Broader Industry Implications

- The speed of adoption for these measures is accelerating due to increasing threats.
- The OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group is now recommending trusted publishing as an industry best practice.
- While these measures may break some existing workflows or feel less convenient, the risk of widespread malware in major package registries means robustness must take priority over ease.

## Conclusion

The Shai-Hulud attack is a wake-up call for the open source community. GitHub’s push towards 2FA, expiring tokens, and especially trusted publishing represents a necessary evolution in DevOps and supply chain practices. These improvements ask all maintainers and contributors to take proactive steps—now—to strengthen the entire ecosystem.
