# Microsoft Defender Advanced Protection Tips for Windows 11

Author: Dellenny

Windows 11 ships with Microsoft Defender Antivirus, providing comprehensive security without needing third-party software. While default settings offer decent protection, you can significantly improve security by enabling advanced features. Here’s how to get the most out of Defender:

## 1. Keep Microsoft Defender Updated

- Defender regularly receives security intelligence updates from Microsoft.
- Ensure **Settings > Windows Update > Advanced options > Receive updates for other Microsoft products** is enabled.
- Run a **Quick Scan** after major updates for peace of mind.

## 2. Turn On Controlled Folder Access

- Protect essential files from ransomware by enabling **Controlled Folder Access**:
  - Go to **Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Ransomware protection**.
  - Enable **Controlled folder access**.
  - Add key folders (Documents, Pictures, OneDrive) to the protected list.

## 3. Use Tamper Protection

- Prevent malware from disabling or changing security settings:
  - Navigate to **Windows Security > Virus & threat protection settings**.
  - Switch on **Tamper Protection**.

## 4. Enable Exploit Protection

- Harden system defenses:
  - Go to **Windows Security > App & browser control > Exploit protection settings**.
  - Stick with default system-wide settings, and consider enabling **ASLR** and **DEP** for extra protection.

## 5. Use SmartScreen for Safer Browsing

- Block phishing sites and unsafe downloads:
  - Go to **Windows Security > App & browser control**.
  - Enable **Check apps and files** and **SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge**.
  - Enable **Potentially unwanted app blocking**.

## 6. Enable Network Protection

- Block connections to dangerous websites across all apps, not just your browser:
  - Open PowerShell (Administrator) and run: `Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled`

## 7. Run Microsoft Defender Offline Scan

- Remove persistent malware:
  - Go to **Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Scan options**.
  - Select **Microsoft Defender Offline scan**.
  - Your PC will reboot and run a deep scan before Windows starts.

## 8. Use Windows Security Notifications Wisely

- Stay informed about threats:
  - Go to **Windows Security > Manage notifications**.
  - Keep essential notifications enabled; turn off nonessential ones if preferred.

## 9. Complement with BitLocker & Backup

- Strengthen security further:
  - Use **BitLocker drive encryption**.
  - Maintain reliable backups (File History, OneDrive, or external drives).

## 10. Regularly Review Security Health

- Monitor overall device health:
  - Open **Windows Security > Device performance & health**.
  - Check for issues and address recommendations promptly.

By enabling these advanced Microsoft Defender features, you can transform your Windows 11 system into a secure environment. Remember to keep your protection up-to-date and maintain safe online practices.
