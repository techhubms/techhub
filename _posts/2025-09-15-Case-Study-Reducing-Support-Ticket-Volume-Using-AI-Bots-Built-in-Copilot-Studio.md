# Case Study: Reducing Support Ticket Volume Using AI Bots Built in Copilot Studio

**Author:** Dellenny

## Introduction

In the digital era, customer support operations often struggle with repetitive queries and high ticket volumes. This case study demonstrates how a mid-sized SaaS provider dramatically reduced support ticket volume using AI-powered bots developed in Microsoft Copilot Studio.

## The Challenge

- High volume of repetitive tickets (~60% related to password resets, account access, FAQs)
- Increased wait times for customers
- Rising operational costs with scaling support staff
- Declining customer satisfaction scores

## The Solution: Copilot Studio AI Bots

The provider introduced AI bots built in Copilot Studio to address common support issues. Key bot functions included:

- Automating answers to frequently asked questions
- Delivering step-by-step troubleshooting guides
- Performing routine tasks (password resets, account recovery)
- Seamlessly escalating complex cases to human agents

Bots were integrated into the existing support portal and communication channels, providing users with immediate assistance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection & Analysis**
   - Exported historical tickets from helpdesk systems (Zendesk, Freshdesk, ServiceNow)
   - Used analytics tools (Power BI, Excel, Copilot Studio analytics) to identify repetitive issues
2. **Bot Design**
   - Created bots in Copilot Studio
   - Defined conversation flows for high-frequency queries
   - Applied prompt engineering for natural dialogue
   - Added conditional logic for troubleshooting (e.g., login failures)
3. **Integration**
   - Connected Copilot Studio to the customer portal through APIs
   - Enabled support across Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and third-party chat platforms
   - Configured Single Sign-On (SSO) for secure processing
4. **Testing & Training**
   - Ran simulations using real support questions
   - Used Copilot Studioâ€™s test environment to refine bot answers
   - Enhanced NLP with synonyms and varied phrasing
5. **Launch & Monitoring**
   - Deployed bots on production support channels
   - Monitored performance via Copilot Studio dashboards:
       - Ticket deflection rates
       - CSAT scores
       - Escalation frequency
   - Updated flows for new FAQs and edge cases

## Results

- **40% reduction** in monthly support ticket volume in three months
- **Instant responses** for common issues, lowering customer wait times by over 70%
- **Greater agent efficiency**, allowing focus on complex queries
- **25% increase** in customer satisfaction survey scores
- **Reduced operational costs**, minimizing the need for additional staff

## Key Takeaways

- **Automation boosts efficiency:** AI bots free agents from routine work
- **Seamless escalation is crucial:** Bots hand off to humans for complex cases
- **Continuous training improves results:** Regular updates enhance accuracy
- **Integration across channels increases adoption:** Embedded bots drive customer usage

## Conclusion

AI bots created with Microsoft Copilot Studio enabled this SaaS provider to balance efficient, automated support for simple issues with human expertise for complex cases. The result was a marked reduction in ticket volume, improved agent productivity, and higher customer satisfaction. This approach showcases how Microsoft AI services, when strategically implemented, can transform support operations in modern organizations.
