# System Initiative Introduces Autonomous AI Agents for Infrastructure Automation

**Author:** Mike Vizard

System Initiative has announced a major update to its infrastructure automation platform with the addition of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents. The new AI agents leverage digital twins of IT environments, enabling DevOps teams to safely propose, validate, and execute changes in their infrastructure.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Autonomous AI Agents:** The platform now uses AI agents that can interact with digital representations (digital twins) of all IT infrastructure elements. This helps teams understand complex relationships and dependencies between resources.
- **Natural Language Prompts:** DevOps engineers can describe desired outcomes using natural language, and the AI agent determines the optimal steps to achieve that outcome. The plan is then reviewed and approved by the DevOps team before execution.
- **Rapid Automation:** Tasks that previously required weeks of manual effort can now be handled by the AI agent in minutes, boosting team efficiency and reducing the likelihood of human error.
- **Safe Change Management:** Custom guardrails and built-in policy checks ensure security and compliance for every change made. The platform allows for the creation of real-time digital twins, offering a comprehensive view and control over the infrastructure.
- **Integration into Existing Workflows:** The addition of AI agents is designed not to disrupt existing processes, integrating seamlessly into DevOps teams’ current workflows.

## Benefits to DevOps Teams

- **Optimized Workflows:** AI agents can reveal hidden relationships between resources, suggest validated changes, and optimize overall infrastructure management.
- **Reduced Misconfigurations:** Automation aims to minimize infrastructure misconfigurations, reducing risks such as vulnerabilities or compliance issues.
- **Increased Research Time:** Automating routine tasks allows DevOps professionals to focus on researching and optimizing environments for more complex and demanding applications.

## Considerations and Challenges

While the system aims to reduce manual errors, there is still a need for DevOps engineers to review and approve all changes proposed by AI agents. The article acknowledges that trust and readiness to adopt this level of automation in DevOps are still evolving topics.

## Conclusion

System Initiative’s update reflects ongoing industry efforts to leverage AI for safer, more efficient infrastructure management, making use of innovative concepts like digital twins and knowledge graphs. The move signals a significant shift towards autonomous, policy-driven IT operations.
