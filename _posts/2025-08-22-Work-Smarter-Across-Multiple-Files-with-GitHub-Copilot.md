# Work Smarter Across Multiple Files with GitHub Copilot

*By Randy Pagels*

When software features and bugs span across multiple files—like controllers, models, tests, and services—it can be challenging to trace connections and ensure everything stays in sync. GitHub Copilot’s multi-file context can understand your whole project, making suggestions that consider how files work together.

## Why Multi-File Context Matters

Working on complex features often requires understanding and changing code in several files at once. Copilot’s project-wide analysis helps you:

- See how data flows between files
- Maintain consistency in related code
- Quickly find, update, and review cross-file logic

## How to Use Copilot for Cross-File Tasks

### Copilot Chat: Cross-File Help

Use chat prompts to ask about data flow or logic connections that span files. For example:

```
# How does data flow from the API route in routes/user.js to the database model in models/user.js?
```

Copilot will read both files and explain their relationship.

### Edit Mode: Refactor Across Files

Highlight code and request edits that require awareness of other files. For example:

```
# Update this method so it stays consistent with changes in services/userService.js
```

Copilot will review the relevant files and keep your changes in sync.

### Agent Mode: High-Level Understanding

Let Copilot summarize complex, cross-cutting logic. Try:

*Summarize how authentication works across this repo, including middleware, routes, and tests.*

Copilot Agent Mode will provide an overview covering multiple files and layers.

## Prompts to Explore

- Show me where this function is called across the project
- Summarize all tests that validate the login process
- Find inconsistencies between this API response and its usage in the frontend

By asking Copilot these kinds of questions, you reduce the manual work of searching, copy-pasting, and tracking project relationships.
