# Unlock Cloud Savings for Linux VMs with the Azure Hybrid Benefit

**Author: Thomas Maurer**

Organizations looking to modernize their infrastructure without overspending can take advantage of the Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux. This offering from Microsoft Azure helps IT leaders make the most of existing Red Hat and SUSE Linux subscriptions while migrating workloads to the cloud, ensuring significant cost savings and operational agility.

## What is Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux?

Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux is a program that enables organizations to use their existing Red Hat and SUSE Linux enterprise subscriptions on Azure. Rather than purchasing new licenses within Azure, businesses can transfer ('bring your own subscription' – BYOS) and apply it to Linux virtual machines, which simplifies migration while reducing costs.

## Key Benefits

- **Cost Savings**: Avoid paying twice for Linux subscriptions — reuse Red Hat or SUSE subscriptions you already own.
- **Modernization**: Migrating critical workloads to the cloud streamlines infrastructure and unlocks enterprise-grade Azure capabilities.
- **Flexibility**: Choose between BYOS or Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) models to fit organizational needs and cash flow.
- **Zero Downtime**: Workloads can be migrated to Azure seamlessly with no service interruptions.

## How Does It Work?

- **Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS):** Use your current Red Hat or SUSE subscription in Azure.
- **PAYG:** If flexibility is preferred, licensing can be managed through Azure, and costs are based on usage.
- **Payment Model Choice:** Organizations select BYOS for maximum value from existing agreements or PAYG for scalable needs.

## Getting Started and Estimating Savings

To estimate savings, use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/). Enter your VM specs, select the desired subscription/licensing model, and view potential savings in real time. Pairing Azure Reserved Instances with Hybrid Benefit can yield up to 76% in cost reductions.

## Migration Path

Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux is designed for straightforward, interruption-free migrations. Organizations can move Red Hat and SUSE workloads to Azure with minimal operational disruption. Microsoft documentation provides comprehensive, step-by-step activation and migration best practices.

## Conclusion

The Azure Hybrid Benefit for Linux equips organizations to reduce cloud costs, modernize infrastructure, and migrate without downtime. With flexible licensing and robust technical documentation, moving enterprise Linux workloads to Azure is economically and operationally practical.
