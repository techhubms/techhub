Dellenny presents a practical guide to using GitHub Copilot as an AI-powered assistant for migrating legacy software, focusing on efficient code refactoring and modernization workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

# How to Migrate Legacy Applications Using GitHub Copilot

Migrating legacy applications to modern platforms is a complex challenge for many development teams. Legacy systems often contain outdated frameworks, unsupported dependencies, and hidden business logic, making refactoring risky and labor-intensive.

## The Role of GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot acts as an AI pair programmer, helping to:

- Accelerate repetitive refactoring tasks
- Suggest modern equivalents for deprecated code
- Provide scaffolding for newer frameworks and modules

While Copilot cannot fully automate migrations, it significantly reduces manual effort and boosts developer productivity.

## Steps for Migration

### 1. Assess and Plan

- **Inventory your current stack**: Identify programming languages, frameworks, and third-party libraries in use.
- **Define your target stack**: Example goals include migrating from Python 2 to Python 3, or .NET Framework to .NET 8.
- **Audit dependencies**: Flag deprecated libraries that need replacement.
- **Testing strategy**: Add unit/integration tests to capture existing behavior.

### 2. Set Up GitHub Copilot

- Install Copilot in your IDE (Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs)
- Use Copilot Chat for migration-specific queries (e.g., "rewrite this function for Python 3 compatibility")
- Configure Copilot for focused suggestions on smaller files/modules

### 3. Incremental Refactoring with Copilot

- **Syntax upgrades**: Copilot can recommend modern syntax (e.g., converting Python 2 `print` statements to Python 3 `print()`)
- **API updates**: Get assistance transitioning from legacy APIs (e.g., older database drivers) to modern equivalents
- **Boilerplate generation**: Let Copilot scaffold new services, classes, or test cases

#### _Example: Python 2 to Python 3_

```python
def greet(name):
    print "Hello, " + name
```

With Copilot:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> None:
    print("Hello, " + name)
```

### 4. Bridging Old and New Components

- Use adapters to allow new modules to interface with legacy components
- Ask Copilot to help draft these adapters

### 5. Validate with Automated Tests

- Copilot can aid in authoring unit tests for legacy code
- Incrementally verify functionality as you modernize modules

### 6. Continuous Integration and Deployment

- Set up CI pipelines to automatically run tests with each migration step
- Deploy updated modules alongside legacy components until the migration is complete

## Best Practices for Copilot in Migration Workflows

- **Review Copilot’s code**: Always verify suggestions, especially for edge cases
- **Work incrementally**: Focus on refactoring one file or module at a time
- **Keep humans in charge**: Use Copilot as an assistant, not an automatic decision-maker
- **Leverage Copilot Chat**: Ask for clarifications on Copilot’s suggestions

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot streamlines the migration process by reducing repetitive work and helping developers focus on strategic tasks. While it won’t replace human expertise, it acts as a skilled assistant, making legacy application modernization more efficient and less daunting.
