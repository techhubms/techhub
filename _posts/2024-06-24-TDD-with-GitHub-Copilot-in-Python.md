In this article, Jesse Swart shares insights into trying out Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, leveraging GitHub Copilot as an assistant. <!--excerpt_end--> Jesse, though experienced with Python coding, had not practiced TDD in Python before. To test Copilot's capabilities in aiding TDD, Jesse decided to build a personal finance administration system, a topic with which they already had some familiarity.

The article outlines Jesse’s motivation for combining TDD with Copilot, highlighting the desire to see if AI can assist with software engineering practices such as writing tests before code. Starting from a project idea sourced from common example lists, Jesse applies Copilot’s auto-suggestion capabilities to scaffold both the required tests and implementation logic.

Throughout the experiment, the author reflects on the workflow, assesses Copilot’s utility for bootstrapping TDD processes, and considers how the AI tool contributes to productivity and project structuring. Jesse's experience demonstrates both the potential of Copilot to support disciplined development practices and the importance of maintaining clear project goals and understanding the domain, exemplified by the choice of a personal finance application.
