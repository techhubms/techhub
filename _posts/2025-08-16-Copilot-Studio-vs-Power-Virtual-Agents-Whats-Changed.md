# Copilot Studio vs. Power Virtual Agents: What’s Changed?

By Dellenny

## 1. Rebranding & Evolution

As of November 15, 2023, Microsoft transitioned Power Virtual Agents (PVA) into Microsoft Copilot Studio. This update is more than a rebranding—it marks an evolution from a standalone chatbot tool to an integrated conversational AI studio, offering expanded generative AI features, multi-channel deployment, and deeper integration with Microsoft 365 and Azure.

## 2. Expanded Capabilities & AI Advancements

- **Generative AI & NLU:** Copilot Studio introduces GPT-based models and improved natural language understanding, enabling the creation or modification of conversational topics through plain language.
- **Plugin & Data Integration:** The platform supports integration with Azure, Microsoft 365, APIs, and third-party sources via custom or pre-built plugins.
- **Workflow & Agent Orchestration:** Central management for multi-step agent workflows extends the capabilities far beyond PVA’s former topic-based bots.

## 3. Broader Deployment & Reach

Agents built in Copilot Studio can now be deployed on:

- Websites
- Mobile apps
- Teams
- Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat
- Other custom applications

This reach goes well past PVA’s previous limitations.

## 4. Licensing & User Impact

Existing PVA customers face no disruption; their bots continue to run under the Copilot Studio interface. The old PVA license is replaced by Copilot Studio licensing, with flexible, capacity-based or pay-as-you-go options that include the enhanced generative AI features.

## 5. Cutting-Edge Automation: “Computer Use”

Launched in April 2025, the “computer use” feature allows Copilot Studio agents to interact directly with websites and desktop apps—automating clicks, text inputs, and dynamic UI adaptation, even where no API is available.

## 6. Customer Stories & Use Cases

Organizations like the Miami Dolphins, Kobe City (Japan), and Rabobank leveraged PVA, while Pets at Home, Holland America Line, Virgin Money, Nsure.com, and ABN AMRO are seeing success with Copilot Studio’s cross-channel, AI-driven agent creation.

## Summary Table: PVA vs. Copilot Studio

| Feature / Capability         | Power Virtual Agents (PVA)        | Copilot Studio                                   |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Branding & Platform         | Power Platform standalone chatbot  | Integrated conversational AI studio              |
| Conversational Logic        | Trigger phrases, topics, templates | Generative AI + NLU-enabled topic generation     |
| Integration                 | Basic connectors                   | Deep plugin/data integration                     |
| Deployment Channels         | Limited (Teams/web)                | Web, mobile, Teams, MS 365, custom apps          |
| Licensing                   | PVA-specific                       | Copilot Studio w/ pay-as-you-go & capacity packs |
| Enhanced Automation         | None                               | “Computer use” for UI-level automation           |
| Continuity for Users        | N/A                                | Smooth transition; old bots persist              |

## What This Means

- **Existing PVA users:** Bots transition smoothly; expanded functionality and broader deployment.
- **New users:** Gain access to rich integration, modern low-code creation, AI-powered orchestration, and powerful automation tools.
- **Overall:** Copilot Studio fuses PVA’s accessibility with generative AI, integration breadth, and next-gen automation, supporting internal, customer-facing, or complex scenario use cases.
