# Atlassian Rovo Dev: AI Coding Agent Now Generally Available

**Author: Mike Vizard**

## Overview

Atlassian has released Rovo Dev, a new artificial intelligence (AI) agent now generally available for developers. Designed to streamline software development workflows, Rovo Dev can write, review, and plan code, and is bundled with Bitbucket CI/CD, Compass (software component catalog), and the DX engineering metrics platform in a unified Software Collection.

## Key Features and Integrations

- **AI-Powered Coding**: Rovo Dev can generate new code and assist in code review tasks, using criteria defined by DevOps teams.
- **DevOps Integration**: Direct integration with Bitbucket allows automated code review and workflow management, while Compass and DX offer capabilities for software component tracking and engineering metrics analysis.
- **Jira Workflow**: Upcoming integrations will allow Jira project tasks to be assigned directly to Rovo Dev, automating the completion of coding tasks.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Developers can interact with Rovo Dev from the terminal for seamless workflow integration.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Utilizes AI frameworks and the Teamwork Graph, enabling orchestration between multiple AI agents (e.g., via Anthropic’s MCP protocol).

## Impact on DevOps and Software Development

- **Productivity Gains**: Automates tedious tasks, increasing developer satisfaction and throughput without requiring a team’s headcount to grow.
- **Software Orchestration**: Supports coordination among agents for more complex workflows, highlighting new needs in orchestrating multiple AI tools and managing code pipelines.
- **Modernizing Legacy Code**: Assists in updating and managing legacy applications using AI-driven processes.
- **Review Process**: Human oversight remains essential—developers are encouraged to review AI-generated code before production deployment.

## Considerations

- Each DevOps team should evaluate how much to rely on AI agents for automation.
- The orchestration and management of multiple agents become key challenges as agent use grows.
