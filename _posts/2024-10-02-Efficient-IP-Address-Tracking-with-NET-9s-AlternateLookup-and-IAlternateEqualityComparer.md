# Efficient IP Address Tracking with .NET 9's AlternateLookup and IAlternateEqualityComparer

## Introduction

In this post, Steve Gordon introduces key enhancements to collections in .NET 9 and C# 13 that enable low-allocation code paths. The focus is on using a custom `IAlternateEqualityComparer` and the new `AlternateLookup` capability on `Dictionary` for efficiently tracking IP address information, using the bytes of IP addresses as keys.

## Use Case

Steve's primary use case for these techniques was to track the number of requests originating from non-GitHub IP addresses during the handling of GitHub webhooks. The objective was to store a small, performant, and memory-efficient amount of state, keyed by the IP address. This article simplifies the scenario to focus on the practical aspects of the new `AlternateLookup` feature in C# 13 and .NET 9.

## Basic Approach

Whenever the application encounters an IP address not known to be from GitHub, it should add the IP to a dictionary if it is new, or retrieve the existing state if it is already present.

### Dictionary Initialization

The data is stored as follows:

```csharp
var dictionary = new Dictionary<ReadOnlyMemory<byte>, string>(ReadOnlyMemoryComparer.Default);
```

- **Key Type:** `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` (representing the IP address bytes)
- **Value Type:** `string` (could be a more complex type in real scenarios)
- **Comparer:** A custom comparer, described below

### Preparing the Key (Low-Allocation Technique)

To avoid unnecessary memory allocations when checking remote IP addresses, Steve uses a `Span<byte>` allocated on the stack:

```csharp
var ipAddress = IPAddress.Parse("172.100.50.50");
var size = ipAddress.AddressFamily == System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily.InterNetwork ? 4 : 16;
Span<byte> key = stackalloc byte[size];
if (!ipAddress.TryWriteBytes(key, out var bytesWritten)) { /* Should never happen */ }
key = key[..bytesWritten];
```

This technique avoids heap allocations by using `stackalloc` for temporary buffers and populates them via `IPAddress.TryWriteBytes`.

## The Need for AlternateLookup

Before .NET 9, it wasn't possible to directly use a `Span<byte>` as a lookup key in a `Dictionary` keyed by a different structure, such as `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`. .NET 9 introduces the `AlternateLookup` feature to allow for such scenarios.

### Custom IAlternateEqualityComparer Implementation

To take advantage of `AlternateLookup`, you must implement an `IAlternateEqualityComparer<TAlternate, TKey>`. Steve shares the full implementation:

```csharp
internal sealed class ReadOnlyMemoryComparer : IEqualityComparer<ReadOnlyMemory<byte>>, IAlternateEqualityComparer<ReadOnlySpan<byte>, ReadOnlyMemory<byte>> {
    public static IEqualityComparer<ReadOnlyMemory<byte>> Default { get; } = new ReadOnlyMemoryComparer();

    public ReadOnlyMemory<byte> Create(ReadOnlySpan<byte> alternate) => alternate.ToArray();

    public bool Equals(ReadOnlySpan<byte> alternate, ReadOnlyMemory<byte> other) => alternate.SequenceEqual(other.Span);

    public bool Equals(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> x, ReadOnlyMemory<byte> y) => x.Span.SequenceEqual(y.Span);

    public int GetHashCode(ReadOnlySpan<byte> alternate) {
        HashCode hc = default;
        hc.AddBytes(alternate);
        return hc.ToHashCode();
    }

    public int GetHashCode(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> obj) => GetHashCode(obj.Span);
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Implements both `IEqualityComparer<ReadOnlyMemory<byte>>` and `IAlternateEqualityComparer<ReadOnlySpan<byte>, ReadOnlyMemory<byte>>`.
- Methods for equality and hashing support both `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` and `ReadOnlySpan<byte>`.
- The `Create` method converts a span to an array for safe dictionary storage (with a minimal heap allocation).
- Caches the comparer instance via a static property.

## Using the AlternateLookup Feature

With the custom comparer in place, you can now create an alternate-lookup view of the dictionary:

```csharp
var alternateLookup = dictionary.GetAlternateLookup<ReadOnlySpan<byte>>();
```

This enables span-based access to the dictionary for both reads and writes:

```csharp
alternateLookup[buffer] = "Hello, world!"; // Adds or updates entry
var exists = alternateLookup.ContainsKey(buffer); // Checks for existence
```

## Performance Considerations

- Stack-allocated buffers and span-based access reduce memory allocations and can improve lookup performance.
- While this pattern could be replicated using `IPAddress` as the key, using byte arrays avoids holding onto larger objects and can provide better performance, though measuring this can be complex.

## Conclusion and Further Application

The `AlternateLookup` feature in .NET 9 collections enables new patterns for high-performance, low-allocation code, especially when working with non-string keys like bytes or chars. Although this article covers a basic introduction, similar techniques can be applied to other data types (e.g., string keys using spans instead of allocations).
