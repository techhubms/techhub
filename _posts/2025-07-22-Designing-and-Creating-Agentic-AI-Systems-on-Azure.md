# Designing and Creating Agentic AI in Azure

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly, and agentic AI‚Äîautonomous systems capable of planning and executing tasks‚Äîhas become a major focus. Microsoft Azure offers a robust set of services for building these next-generation agents. This guide explores what agentic AI is and provides a step-by-step approach to architecting, implementing, and deploying such systems using Azure services.

## üß† What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems operate with autonomy and can:

- Understand and decompose goals
- Plan and execute tasks
- Invoke external services or APIs
- Adapt to environmental changes
- Learn from feedback

Unlike traditional AI that reacts to prompts, agentic AI takes initiative, orchestrates tools, and manages complex workflows.

## üîß Key Azure Tools for Agentic AI

| Service                 | Role                                            |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Azure OpenAI           | Natural language understanding (GPT models)      |
| Azure Functions        | Serverless code execution                        |
| Azure Logic Apps       | Workflow orchestration                          |
| Azure Cognitive Search | External knowledge/document retrieval           |
| Azure Cosmos DB        | Agent memory/state storage                      |
| Azure Machine Learning | Custom model training/evaluation                |
| Azure AI Studio        | Prompt engineering and orchestration            |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture of Agentic AI on Azure

**Sample Workflow:**

1. **User Input** ‚Üí Azure OpenAI (GPT)
2. **Planning Module**
   - Task breakdown (Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought)
3. **Tool Selection**
   - Call Azure Functions/Logic Apps for execution
4. **Result Evaluation**
   - Interpret results and decide next steps
5. **Final Output**

**Core Components:**

- **Prompt Orchestrator**: Define agent behavior in Azure AI Studio.
- **Memory Management**: Use Cosmos DB or Blob Storage for conversation and state storage.
- **Tool Calling**: Integrate Azure Functions for actionable steps‚Äîsending emails, querying databases, etc.
- **Reasoning Loop**: Implement recursive execution using GPT's function-calling API (ReAct, AutoGPT, BabyAGI patterns).

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide: Building Agentic AI

1. **Set Up Azure OpenAI**
   - Deploy GPT-4/GPT-4-turbo in Azure Portal
   - Enable function calling features

2. **Define Agent Prompts**
   - Example: System prompt for a task-solving agent (via Azure AI Studio or prompt engineering tools).

   ```yaml
   System Prompt: You are a task-solving agent. When a user provides a goal, break it into steps. Use tools as needed, reasoning step-by-step.
   User: I want to organize a meeting with my team next week.
   ```

3. **Enable Function Calling**
   - Define a JSON schema for tools the agent can use (e.g., schedule_meeting for Outlook integration).

   ```json
   {
     "name": "schedule_meeting",
     "description": "Schedules a meeting using Outlook calendar",
     "parameters": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "date": { "type": "string" },
         "time": { "type": "string" },
         "attendees": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
       },
       "required": ["date", "time", "attendees"]
     }
   }
   ```

   - Bind schema to an Azure Function integrated with Microsoft Graph API.

4. **Create Function and Logic Apps**
   - Use Azure Functions for custom logic (e.g., scheduling a meeting):

   ```python
   # Example Azure Function to schedule a meeting
   import requests
   def main(req):
       data = req.get_json()
       # Call Microsoft Graph API to schedule a meeting
       return {
           "status": "success",
           "details": f"Meeting scheduled for {data['date']} at {data['time']}"
       }
   ```

5. **Implement Reasoning Loop**
   - Let GPT model plan, execute tools, and update agent state, iterating as needed.
   - Orchestrate complex chains via Logic Apps or custom Python code.

6. **Add Long-Term Memory**
   - Use Cosmos DB to persist goals, actions, and context.
   - Enable retrieval with semantic search if needed.

## ü§ñ Example: Enterprise Assistant

Build a corporate assistant capable of:

- Answering internal company questions
- Scheduling meetings
- Summarizing emails
- Generating reports

**Architecture Overview:**

- Azure OpenAI (GPT-4-turbo)
- Azure Cognitive Search (knowledge retrieval)
- Azure Functions (execution)
- Azure Logic App (workflow)
- Cosmos DB (memory management)

## üß© Best Practices

- **Input Validation**: Double-check function inputs before execution.
- **Feedback Loops**: Prompt users for confirmation (‚ÄúDid this work?‚Äù).
- **Observability**: Use Azure Monitor for logs, tracing, and cost tracking.
- **Security**: Implement RBAC and secure all APIs.
- **Prompt Evaluation**: Utilize promptflow or Azure ML pipelines to continuously test prompts.

For hands-on implementation, follow each step to implement robust, autonomous agents leveraging the breadth of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI ecosystem.
