# Tabnine Launches AI Agents for Automated DevOps Workflows

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Tabnine, a well-known provider of AI-powered coding assistance, has introduced Tabnine Agentic, a new generation of AI agents that bring automation to a wide range of DevOps workflows, including code refactoring, debugging, and documentation.

## What Is Tabnine Agentic?

Tabnine Agentic leverages the company’s Context Engine to understand and reason across code repositories, development tools, and organizational policies. This enables the agents to execute multi-step development tasks, such as:

- Refactoring large codebases
- Debugging across multiple tools
- Creating code documentation automatically

Unlike traditional AI code-suggestion tools, Tabnine Agentic provides autonomous agents capable of handling entire workflows instead of just suggesting small code snippets.

## How Does It Work?

The Context Engine adapts to new codebases and policies without the need for retraining or redeployment. It achieves this flexibility through:

- **Vector, graph, and agentic retrieval techniques** for understanding the evolving context of code
- Decoupling from specific LLMs (Large Language Models), allowing teams to use their LLM of choice or connect Tabnine’s Context Engine to a preferred model
- A straightforward, flat monthly fee pricing structure with optional per-use LLM-access charges

## Governance, Compliance, and Cost Control

Tabnine Agentic offers centralized controls for governance, letting organizations enforce permissions, usage quotas, and compliance-oriented audit trails. Teams can:

- Define policies for how agents operate across the SDLC
- Apply limits by team or business unit to manage costs
- Audit agent activity for security or regulatory purposes

## Addressing Challenges with AI Automation

With AI tooling writing more code than ever, DevOps teams face growing challenges around cost, code quality, and technical debt. Tabnine's approach allows organizations to keep control over how agents operate, preventing uncontrolled code growth and protecting sensitive data handled within automated workflows.

## Key Takeaways

- **Autonomous DevOps workflows:** Tabnine’s AI agents automate complex, multi-step tasks like refactoring, debugging, and documentation.
- **Governance:** Centralized controls to enforce compliance and manage usage
- **Flexible AI architecture:** Integrates with a variety of LLMs for maximum adaptability
- **Cost management:** Predictable pricing models and quota controls
- **Technical debt mitigation:** Provides oversight to manage AI-generated code growth

For DevOps engineers and technical decision-makers, this represents an important step towards bringing structure and accountability to automated, AI-driven development environments.
