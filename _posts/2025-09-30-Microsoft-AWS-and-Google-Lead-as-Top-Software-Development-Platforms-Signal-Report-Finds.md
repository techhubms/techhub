# Report: Microsoft, AWS and Google Atop Software Development Platform Heap

**By Mike Vizard**

The Futurum Group's most recent Signal report has identified Microsoft, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google as the top three software development platform providers for 2025. Based on an in-depth 100-point analysis—including criteria like business value, product innovation, technology capabilities, strategic vision, go-to-market execution, and ecosystem alignment—the report highlights that all three achieved 'Elite' status with results over 90 points each.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Microsoft's Leadership:** Microsoft stands out as the only platform to score over 90 points in all five evaluation categories. Their enduring commitment to developers, emphasis on innovation, and strong ecosystem positions Microsoft at the forefront.
- **Increasing Competition:** AWS and Google are increasingly competitive, especially through rapid innovation and strong AI integration into their DevOps and development lifecycles.
- **Other Contenders:** Oracle, IBM, Red Hat, GitHub, Atlassian, and Salesforce also scored above 80, indicating a fiercely competitive market.
- **DevOps and Workflow Integration:** The report discusses how these platforms are deeply embedded into organizations' DevOps workflows. Once adopted, development platforms tend to be long-term decisions, with vendors investing heavily to retain their base.
- **AI Impact:** The rise of AI is disrupting traditional software development patterns, making ongoing innovation and integration of advanced technologies even more critical for platform leaders.

## Detailed Findings

- Microsoft, AWS, and Google are noted for their breadth of features, depth, and speed of innovation.
- The report suggests platform selection varies across organizations, with many large enterprises using multiple platforms for different application needs.
- Microsoft's decades-long focus on developers sets it apart, particularly with tools supporting both Windows and Linux development.
- The report anticipates ongoing fierce competition as other software platform vendors seek to close the gap with the top three.

## Competitive Landscape

- **Microsoft:** Highest scores due to consistent investment in developer tools, innovation, and ecosystem reach.
- **AWS & Google:** Noted for closing gaps through cloud-native features, AI-powered development tools, and growing ecosystems.
- **Challenger Platforms:** Companies like Oracle, IBM, Red Hat, and GitHub remain strong contenders, especially for organizations with complex or hybrid requirements.

## Implications for Organizations

Organizations rarely switch software development platforms lightly. Once a platform is deeply integrated into DevOps workflows, vendor changes are infrequent and often challenging. The report stresses that platform providers will continue to prioritize comprehensive feature sets and robust ecosystem support to limit churn.
