# Craft Prompts That Get Better Results

*Posted on May 23, 2025 by Randy Pagels*

When your prompts for GitHub Copilot don’t deliver what you expect, it’s time to step up your prompt-writing game. This guide covers the essentials of making your requests as clear and effective as possible—think of guiding Copilot like mentoring a junior developer.

## Why Prompt Clarity Matters

Large language models respond best to instructions that are unambiguous and well-structured. Instead of short, vague comments, give Copilot specific goals, context, and constraints. It’s not about sounding smart—it’s about being precise.

## Practical Formula for Strong Prompts

**[Goal] + [Tech/Context] + [Constraints or Style]**

This formula can help shape your prompts for maximum clarity.

### Examples

- **Task + Context**
  - `# Write a Python function that parses a CSV and returns rows where age > 30`
    - Direct and focused.

- **Step-by-Step Structure**
  - `# Step-by-step: 1. Read a CSV file 2. Filter rows by a column value 3. Return filtered list`
    - Breaking the problem into steps often yields cleaner code.

- **Style or Approach Guidance**
  - `// Write a TypeScript function that uses map/filter instead of a for loop`
    - Guides Copilot toward your preferred coding style or technique.

- **Persona-Based Prompt**
  - `// Act like a senior front-end engineer writing a reusable button component in React with TypeScript and Tailwind`
    - Setting a role helps Copilot align with real-world conventions.

- **Context-Framing Prompt**
  - `# This YAML defines a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on every push to the main branch using Node.js 18`
    - Summarizing the file’s purpose helps Copilot generate the right boilerplate.

## Debugging Your Prompts

If Copilot’s output isn’t right, try rewording your comment or add steps one at a time. The more specific and structured your instructions, the better Copilot performs.

## Quick Takeaway

When Copilot isn’t hitting the mark, structure and context will unlock better results. Treat your prompt as a set of clear instructions for a new teammate, and you’ll see more relevant, high-quality code suggestions.
