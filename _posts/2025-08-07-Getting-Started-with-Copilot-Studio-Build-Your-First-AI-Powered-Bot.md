# Getting Started with Copilot Studio: Build Your First AI-Powered Bot

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become accessible for practical, real-world applications. With Microsoft Copilot Studio, anyone can create intelligent bots (copilots) through a simple, low-code approach—no advanced coding required.

## What is Copilot Studio?

Copilot Studio is Microsoft’s low-code platform designed to help users build, customize, and deploy AI-powered bots. It integrates:

- **Power Virtual Agents:** Conversation design for bots
- **Azure OpenAI Service:** Natural language understanding (NLP)
- **Power Automate:** Automations and integrations for data and workflows

It’s deeply connected to the Power Platform, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and supports a variety of data sources via connectors.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft 365 or Power Platform account with Copilot Studio access
- Basic understanding of chatbots and conversational flow
- (Optional) Access to Microsoft Dataverse or APIs for integration

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Access Copilot Studio

- Go to [copilotstudio.microsoft.com](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)
- Sign in with your Microsoft account
- Select your preferred environment (such as development or testing)

### 2. Create a New Copilot

- Click **Create → Start from blank**
- Name your bot (e.g., "IT Support Bot")
- Select a language and environment
- Click **Create** to open the authoring canvas

### 3. Define Topics

Topics determine what your bot can address.

- Click **Topics** in the left pane
- **+ New topic** for issues like "Reset Password"
- Add trigger phrases (e.g., “I forgot my password”, “Help me reset my password”)
- Use the visual editor to map out conversation flows, messages, prompts, conditions, and actionable steps (like calling a Power Automate flow)

### 4. Test Your Bot

- Use the **Test Copilot** panel to try out different user phrases
- Refine the conversation as needed based on responses

### 5. Integrate and Extend

To add richer functionality—like sending an email or accessing third-party APIs:

- Use **Call an action** to integrate Power Automate flows
- Configure data input and output as part of the topic’s flow
- Integrate with Outlook, SharePoint, Dataverse, or external applications

### 6. Publish and Share

- Click **Publish** when your bot is ready
- Connect to multiple channels, such as Microsoft Teams, your website (embed code), Facebook Messenger, or custom apps

### Bonus: Generative AI Capabilities

Enhance your copilot by enabling generative answers:

- Go to **Settings → Generative AI**
- Enable generative answers and attach internal/external documents or SharePoint links
- Your bot can now handle questions beyond preset topics, leveraging uploaded data

### Next Steps

After deploying, consider these further enhancements:

- Review **analytics** for performance insights
- Use **multi-turn conversations** for complex requirements
- Add **authentication** for secure interactions
- Collaborate with your team to iterate and scale
