description: "This article reports on SonarSource's findings regarding code generated by leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4. It explores the dual nature of LLM-generated code: while functional and versatile, it often contains critical security vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, and poor maintainability. The report emphasizes the need for DevOps teams to rigorously review code produced by AI tools, highlighting the importance of understanding each model's inherent biases, code smells, and the long-term technical debt they introduce. Challenges with debugging and trust in LLM-generated code are also discussed."

# SonarSource Highlights Security Risks and Code Quality Issues in LLM-Generated Code

**Author:** Mike Vizard

SonarSource has released a comprehensive analysis of code produced by various large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 and 3.7, Meta’s Llama-3.2-vision:90b, and OpenCoder-8B. The study evaluated more than 4,400 Java programming assignments using the company's proprietary analysis framework.

## Key Findings

- **High Functionality, High Risk:** LLMs like Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to a 95.57% success rate on HumanEval, reflecting their advanced ability to generate executable, correct code for a range of problems.
- **Frequent Security Flaws:** Despite their capabilities, all models consistently produced code with significant vulnerabilities, such as hard-coded credentials and path traversal issues. For example, more than 70% of vulnerabilities in Llama-3.2-vision:90b output were rated 'blocker' severity; GPT-4o showed 62.5%, and Claude Sonnet 4 nearly 60% with similar severity.
- **Trade-offs Between Accuracy and Risk:** Improved functional benchmarks (e.g., performance gains in Claude Sonnet 4 over its predecessor) often led to increased rates of severe security bugs—up 93% in some cases.
- **Poor Maintainability:** Over 90% of identified issues were 'code smells'—indicators of poor structure, redundancy, or low maintainability, contributing to long-term technical debt.
- **Model Personality and Bias:** Each LLM exhibited a distinct 'coding personality.' Developers are urged to understand and account for the biases and verbosity tendencies embedded in each model.

## DevOps and Security Implications

Prasenjit Sarkar of SonarSource stressed the need for DevOps teams to thoroughly review LLM-generated code and to recognize both the strengths and weaknesses inherent in these AI tools. He notes that messy or verbose code is not only difficult to debug and fix, but may also require separate AI agents to assist in reviewing and maintaining code quality.

## Trust and Productivity

While LLM coding tools can boost developer productivity, the article cautions that these short-term gains may lead to hidden costs in future security incidents or maintenance challenges. It remains uncertain to what extent DevOps teams trust and widely adopt these AI-based coding solutions.

## Recommendations

- Always review, test, and secure code output from LLMs before deployment.
- Educate teams about risks of hard-coded secrets and code smells in generated code.
- Balance productivity benefits with long-term quality and security considerations.
