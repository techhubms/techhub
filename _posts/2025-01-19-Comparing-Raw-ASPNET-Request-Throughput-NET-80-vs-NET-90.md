# Comparing Raw ASP.NET Request Throughput: .NET 8.0 vs .NET 9.0

## Introduction

Whenever a new .NET release comes out, I run comparison tests using simple load testing tools to see how the new version stacks up against previous releases. In this post, I focus on .NET 9.0 compared to .NET 8.0. I share not only benchmark numbers, but also anecdotes from running .NET 9.0 in production apps over the past couple months.

## Test Approach

For these tests, I use extremely simple ASP.NET JSON endpoints—both Minimal APIs and ASP.NET Controllers—and hit them with heavy local web load tests. The goal isn't to conduct scientific benchmarks, but to get a practical sense of performance changes across versions on the same hardware.

Benefits of this approach:

- See throughput for high-load ASP.NET servers and .NET clients.
- Compare .NET versions year-over-year on the same machine.

The code and test setup are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/RickStrahl/HighPerformanceAspNet). The main endpoint simply responds with a small JSON payload for both GET and POST requests. For load testing, I use my own [West Wind WebSurge](https://websurge.west-wind.com/), which simplifies setup. Example request and session files are included.

For these runs, everything is local on a high-end laptop (I9, 13th gen, 32 GB RAM, fast NVMe drive). The focus: compare raw throughput under best-case conditions.

## .NET 9.0: First Impressions

Subjectively, .NET 9.0 feels snappier than 8.0:

- Startup speed is noticeably improved for web and desktop apps.
- Overall responsiveness is a bit better.
- Memory usage is significantly reduced.

However, the actual numbers show a mixed bag: .NET 9.0 is roughly on par with 8.0 in throughput, sometimes slightly slower, but with much lower memory consumption.

## Test Setup Details

**Hardware:**

- MSI GE68HX laptop
- Intel I9, 13th gen
- 32 GB RAM, 7,000 MB/sec NVMe drive

**Environment Prep:**

- Windows Defender disabled (to remove interference)
- Docker not running (for network consistency)
- Use plain HTTP (`http://`) instead of HTTPS for maximum throughput (~10-15% performance hit avoided)
- Fresh app startups, warm-up runs before measuring

.NET web apps are run using published release builds and Kestrel directly:

```powershell
 dotnet publish HighPerformanceAspNet.csproj -o ../Publish -c Release
 ../publish/HighPerformanceAspNet --urls http://dev.west-wind.com:5200
```

Note: Using HTTP allows up to 13% more requests/second compared to HTTPS in local tests.

## Test Scenarios & Code

### Minimal API Example

```csharp
app.MapGet("/hello", () => new { name = "Rick", message = "Hello World" });
app.MapPost("/hello", (RequestMessage model) => new { name = model.Name, message = model.Message });
```

### Controller Example

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class ClassicController : ControllerBase {
    [HttpGet("hello")]
    public object Hello() => new { name = "Rick", message = "Hello World" };

    [HttpPost("hello")]
    public object Hello(RequestMessage model) => new { name = model.Name, message = model.Message };
}
```

These methods implement the most basic logic to focus purely on routing, serialization, and response throughput—not on realistic business logic or data access.

## Benchmark Results

**All numbers represent requests per second (RPS).**

### WebSurge UI Results

| Framework      | .NET 9.0 | .NET 8.0 | .NET 7.0 |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Minimal APIs  | 164,250  | 168,250  | 160,250  |
| Controllers   | 151,750  | 160,750  | 150,500  |

### WebSurge CLI Results

| Framework      | .NET 9.0 | .NET 8.0 | .NET 7.0 |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Minimal APIs  | 180,000  | 189,000  | 161,200  |
| Controllers   | 173,500  | 183,250  | 150,500  |

**Observation:** .NET 9.0 is slightly slower than .NET 8.0 in these micro-benchmark scenarios, despite subjective feelings. However, memory usage is markedly lower in .NET 9.0.

### Resource Usage: .NET 9.0 vs .NET 8.0

Memory consumption for .NET 9.0 is significantly reduced—more than 10x less in some test runs. In real internal apps, the reduction is 2x-3x, which is still substantial.

You can check process memory via PowerShell:

```powershell
get-process -Name "HighPerformanceAspNet" | Select-Object Name, Id, @{Name="WorkingSet (MB)";Expression={---

### Garbage Collection Adaptation Mode

.NET 9.0 introduced a default resource-saving garbage collection mode (`<GarbageCollectionAdaptationMode>1</GarbageCollectionAdaptationMode>`), trading off slight performance for lower memory. Setting this flag to `0` (`<GarbageCollectionAdaptationMode>0</GarbageCollectionAdaptationMode>`) returns to the greedier GC approach, boosting throughput slightly at the cost of higher memory use.

Switching this setting:

- Raises throughput by ~2.5%, matching .NET 8.0 levels.
- Memory usage increases, showing a clear trade-off that developers can tune dynamically.

## UI vs. CLI Clients

Interestingly, the CLI (command-line interface) version of WebSurge is about 10% more efficient than the desktop UI version. Even minimal UI updates add measurable overhead.

Similarly, running WebSurge on .NET 9.0 boosts client performance by about 8% over .NET 8.0. The improvement seems more pronounced on desktop than server, possibly due to framework improvements in UI, text encoding, and HTTP libraries.

## Network vs. Local Tests

All above results are from same-machine tests, which yield highest throughput due to near-zero networking overhead. Even on a 10Gbps network, distributed client/server tests can't match local results—network stack or Windows client throttling may cap maximum throughput.

In real-world, when database access or complex logic is added, throughput drops by over 10x due to contention and resource limits.

## Summary & Takeaways

- **Performance:** .NET 9.0 server throughput is nearly on par with 8.0 but not notably faster. .NET 9.0 is a bit slower out of the box (with default resource-saving GC), but configuration can mitigate the difference.
- **Resource Usage:** Major reduction in memory footprint in .NET 9.0 (2-10x, scenario dependent). Benefits both server and especially desktop/CLI clients like WebSurge.
- **Developer Experience:** Updates are largely seamless; most apps require no code changes.
- **Practical Advice:** Test your own apps, especially with different garbage collection modes, to find your optimal balance between performance and resource savings.
- **General Outlook:** .NET has reached a point of high, stable performance. Future gains may be incremental, but reduction in resource usage is a very real benefit, especially at scale.
