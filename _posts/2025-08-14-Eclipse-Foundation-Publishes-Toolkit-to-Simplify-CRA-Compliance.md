# Eclipse Foundation Publishes Toolkit to Simplify CRA Compliance

**Author:** Mike Vizard

The Eclipse Foundation has introduced the Open Source Compliance: Comprehensive Techniques and Essential Tools (OCCTET) project, aimed at helping organizations—especially smaller ones—meet the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) requirements by September 2026.

## Key Points

- **Purpose**: OCCTET offers open-source tools to help organizations comply with the mandatory cybersecurity requirements for all digital products under the EU CRA.
- **Toolkit Features**:
  - CRA compliance checklist
  - Conformity assessment specifications
  - Automated evaluation methods and tools
  - Federated database for assessments of open source software components
  - Inventories of automatic dependency analysis tools
  - Documentation and evidence generation tools
- **Collaboration**: The toolkit is a product of the Open Regulatory Compliance (ORC) Working Group, now with over 50 members, including major organizations like Microsoft, GitHub, Red Hat, and more.
- **Goal**: Simplify the compliance process for smaller organizations while serving as a starting framework for larger firms requiring more comprehensive solutions.

## Industry Context

The EU CRA sets a high bar for cybersecurity and regulatory compliance across Europe. The OCCTET initiative responds to a growing need for practical, scalable compliance workflows as regulatory pressures increase. Achieving CRA compliance may also help organizations align with other global regulatory frameworks.

## Forward-Looking Considerations

- **Adoption**: Organizations should assess the degree to which CRA requirements apply to them and leverage available tools for efficient compliance.
- **Outlook**: The increasing regulatory landscape demands that even smaller organizations adopt systematic approaches to compliance and cybersecurity.
- **Industry Support**: With support from Microsoft, GitHub, and other industry leaders, OCCTET aims to raise the security baseline across the open-source and software development communities.
