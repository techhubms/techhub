# Supercharge Your Debugging with Remote Tools for Microsoft Edge

**Author:** Dellenny

Remote Tools for Microsoft Edge provide developers with a powerful suite for remote inspection and debugging across diverse platforms, from smartphones to embedded and XR devices.

## What Are Remote Tools for Microsoft Edge?

Remote Tools let you connect to Edge running on another device—such as Windows PCs, Xbox, HoloLens, IoT devices, or VMs—and inspect or debug web content using your local Edge DevTools. This allows real-time remote debugging without switching environments.

**Capabilities include:**

- Inspecting and debugging websites on remote/embedded devices
- Accessing DevTools for headless Edge instances
- Performance tuning and layout troubleshooting
- Simulating remote network conditions

## Practical Use Cases

- **Mobile Web Debugging:** Connect desktop DevTools to Edge on Windows tablets or mobiles
- **Virtual Environments:** Debug Edge running inside VMs or containers from your host OS
- **IoT & Embedded:** Troubleshoot kiosk systems, automotive dashboards, or smart displays
- **Headless Automation:** Inspect automated test environments on headless devices

## Key Features

### Remote DevTools Protocol (RDP)

Edge implements the Chromium Remote Debugging Protocol so you can connect DevTools over local networks or the internet with proper security.

### WebView2 Debugging

Developers building desktop apps with WebView2 can remotely inspect and profile embedded Edge web content as easily as in a standalone browser.

### Microsoft Edge DevTools App

Windows 10/11 users can install the DevTools Preview app from Microsoft Store, connecting to remote Edge via IP and port.

### Platform Support

Remote Tools support Edge on Xbox and HoloLens, so you can debug web experiences on gaming or AR/VR hardware.

## Getting Started: Setup Instructions

1. **Enable Remote Debugging**
   - Start Edge on the remote device with the `--remote-debugging-port=<PORT>` flag. Example:
   
     ```bash
     msedge --remote-debugging-port=9222
     ```

2. **Connect from DevTools**
   - On your primary machine, open `edge://inspect` in Microsoft Edge and enter the remote device's IP and port to discover open tabs or webviews.

3. **Start Debugging**
   - Click “Inspect” to launch a DevTools session with any available remote tab or view.

## Security Considerations

- Always secure the debugging port—use SSH tunneling or VPN for connections
- Never expose debugging ports to public networks without authentication
- In production, restrict access to trusted IP ranges for added safety

## Summary

Remote Tools for Microsoft Edge enable seamless debugging across platforms, helping developers deliver reliable and performant web experiences whether targeting desktops, mobile devices, VMs, or emerging hardware such as Xbox and HoloLens. The tight integration with DevTools and support for open protocols broadens debugging capabilities for complex, real-world applications.
