## Debug Faster with GitHub Copilot

*Posted on Jun 20, 2025 by Randy Pagels*

Debugging is a necessary part of development, but it often slows down productivity. In this guide, we explore how GitHub Copilot can streamline the debugging process so you can focus more on coding and less on troubleshooting.

### How GitHub Copilot Improves Debugging

GitHub Copilot can help diagnose errors, suggest relevant fixes, and even generate test cases that reduce the risk of problems down the road. Here’s a closer look at how you can use Copilot for debugging tasks:

---

#### 1. Explain Errors

If you encounter an error message, you can have Copilot interpret it and propose a fix. For example:

**Python Example:**

```python
# Explain this error and suggest a fix
```

This is useful for deciphering complex stack traces or unfamiliar errors, accelerating your understanding and resolution process.

#### 2. Find Bugs in Your Code

Have Copilot review your function logic for potential issues by inserting a prompt before your function definition:

**JavaScript Example:**

```javascript
// Review this function and suggest potential issues
```

Copilot will analyze the logic and highlight possible bugs or logical errors.

#### 3. Generate Debugging Code

If you need help with adding debug statements, Copilot can provide logging or print statements automatically:

**Python Example:**

```python
# Add debug print statements to this function
```

This lets you see what’s happening at runtime, helping you identify the root of a problem.

#### 4. Write Test Cases to Catch Bugs

Generating test cases can help you detect potential bugs before they reach production. With Copilot, you can do this quickly:

**TypeScript Example:**

```typescript
// Generate a unit test for this function
```

Test cases produced by Copilot can act as a safety net to prevent regressions and undetected bugs.

### Quick Takeaway

Let GitHub Copilot take some of the pain out of debugging. By leveraging its ability to explain errors, detect bugs, generate debug statements, and write test cases, you can spend less time troubleshooting and more time building features.
