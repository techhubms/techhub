# Opsera Introduces AI Agent for Analyzing Code Quality from AI Coding Tools

**Author: Mike Vizard**

Opsera has enhanced its DevOps automation platform with the introduction of a specialized artificial intelligence (AI) reasoning agent. Trained to interpret and surface valuable insights, this agent helps DevOps teams understand how AI coding tools are being used within their workflows and whether these tools contribute positively to code quality.

## Key Features and Updates

- **AI Reasoning Agent (Hummingbird AI):**
  - Analyzes code generated by AI coding tools.
  - Monitors which developers' AI-generated code reaches production.
  - Tracks usage, adoption, productivity metrics, and optimization opportunities.
  - Recommends strategies for optimizing token usage and productivity.

- **DevOps Workflow Automation:**
  - Enhanced platform for managing and automating diverse DevOps workflows.
  - Integration with GitHub's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling richer context and interoperability for AI-assisted development.

- **On-Premises Solution (Insights in a Box):**
  - Targets organizations with strict compliance or data residency requirements.
  - Aggregates and normalizes data from across the development ecosystem, presenting key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with DORA metrics.

## Implementation and Benefits

The new Hummingbird AI agent enables:

- Real-time insight into the effectiveness and quality of AI-generated code.
- Productivity analysis, including which AI coding tools lead to higher quality outputs.
- Natural language querying for DevOps teams (e.g., asking “why” or “how” questions about code or performance).
- Recommendations delivered via integrations with large language models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI and Anthropic.
- Better resource allocation by identifying which developers are leveraging AI tools most effectively.

## Addressing Challenges of Generative AI in DevOps

- The article acknowledges the growing use of AI-generated code, bringing both productivity gains and new risks such as increased vulnerabilities and technical debt from code that is misunderstood or inefficient.
- Opsera's approach aims for increased visibility and quality control, using AI to oversee and optimize the contributions of other AI coding tools.

## Conclusion

As DevOps teams face a deluge of code from proliferating AI tools, Opsera's new AI agent—together with MCP and on-premises integration—seeks to provide actionable intelligence, reduce risk, and maximize development productivity.
