# Top 10 Things You Can Do with GitHub Copilot as a New Developer

GitHub Copilot can be a transformative tool for those starting their coding journey. Far beyond simple autocompletion, it's like having a mentor right inside your code editor, offering real-time suggestions, educational insights, and productivity boosts.

## 1. Get Instant Code Suggestions

Copilot can autocomplete your code as you type—whether you're working in Python, JavaScript, CSS, or other languages—providing smart, context-aware suggestions to save time and introduce you to industry coding patterns.

## 2. Learn by Example

By typing descriptive comments (e.g., “function to check if a number is prime”), Copilot generates working code, letting you observe how specific problems can be solved in different languages and styles.

## 3. Write Boilerplate Code Quickly

Copilot facilitates rapid project setup by generating commonly required code like server scaffolding, HTML templates, or API routes so you can focus on more meaningful tasks.

## 4. Explore New Programming Languages

If you're new to Go, Rust, TypeScript, or other unfamiliar languages, Copilot offers syntax examples and starter code, breaking the barrier to learning new technologies.

## 5. Generate Unit Tests

Writing tests is vital but often repetitive. Copilot can suggest relevant unit tests for your functions, demonstrating how to validate and verify your work.

## 6. Get Help with Documentation

Copilot assists in drafting docstrings, inline comments, and sections of documentation—developing your ability to explain code, which is a key skill for collaboration and maintainability.

## 7. Experiment with Algorithms

When exploring various solutions to a problem, Copilot can provide multiple suggestions, allowing you to compare alternatives and learn best practices.

## 8. Speed Up Debugging

Although Copilot isn’t a dedicated debugger, it can help fix errors by generating improved code when you describe problems in comments (like “fix function to handle null values”).

## 9. Improve Your Coding Style

Copilot’s suggestions are based on a vast range of open-source code, encouraging the use of clean, modern, and idiomatic programming patterns.

## 10. Build Projects Faster

By helping you overcome technical roadblocks—from small scripts to full-stack apps—Copilot increases your development speed and allows you to build more, helping you focus on the logic and reasoning behind code, not just syntax.

> **Note:** GitHub Copilot is best used as a guide—accelerating learning but not substituting genuine understanding. Treat it as a 24/7 pair-programming partner that helps you practice, explore, and gain confidence.
