# Shortcut Introduces Korey AI Agent for Software Project Management

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Shortcut has unveiled Korey, an AI-driven agent designed to streamline the planning, tracking, and coordination of software development projects for engineering teams. CEO Kurt Schrader highlights that Korey can take high-level project ideas expressed in natural language and translate them into structured, build-ready plans within seconds. These plans include detailed specifications and clearly defined acceptance criteria.

## Core Capabilities of Korey

- **Natural Language Input:** Converts ideas and requirements into well-defined project tasks using advanced AI techniques.
- **Actionable Task Breakdown:** Automatically generates workflows, tracks dependencies, and summarizes ongoing project status.
- **Integrated Context Awareness:** Pulls information from project comments, GitHub activity, and other connected tools, making planning more accurate and relevant to real-world engineering practices.
- **Continuous Learning:** Learns individual and team workflows over time, enhancing the relevance and quality of project planning and management.

## Benefits for DevOps and Engineering Teams

- Provides instant visibility into blockers, progress, and overall status across software projects.
- Allows modification of assignments, sprint setups, and workflow item organization directly through the AI agent.
- Delegates specific tasks to engineers, designers, or even other AI agents, reducing manual effort and error.
- Aims to reduce repetitive tasks, giving teams more time for high-value engineering work and minimizing burnout.

## Product Context

Formerly known as Clubhouse, Shortcut has been offering a project management alternative to Jira since 2014. Major customers include The Farmerâ€™s Dog, Dataiku, Crossbeam, and Octopus Deploy. The company intends to extend Korey's capabilities to integrate with Jira and other tools commonly used by engineering teams.

## Industry Outlook

While engineering teams continue adopting AI assistants for coding tasks, Korey represents a move toward AI solutions that handle broader processes like project orchestration and workflow automation. As teams automate more mundane tasks, overall productivity may increase. The article notes, however, that human oversight remains essential to ensure successful project outcomes.
