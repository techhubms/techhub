# Claude Introduces Agent Skills for Custom AI Workflows

*By Tom Smith*

Anthropic has launched Agent Skills for Claude, a feature that empowers teams to package instructions, scripts, and resources as reusable folders (called Skills) accessible across Claude's web app, API, and Claude Code environments. This development marks a significant shift for AI workflow automation, especially for DevOps and infrastructure engineering teams.

## What Are Skills?

A Skill is a folder containing structured instructions and domain-specific resources. Claude automatically loads relevant Skills when a task matches their domain, allowing:

- **Composable Workflows:** Multiple Skills can work together, coordinated internally by Claude.
- **Portability:** Skills maintain the same structure across the web app, API, and Claude Code.
- **Efficiency:** Only necessary parts of Skills are loaded for fast, relevant assistance.
- **Embedded Code Execution:** Skills can contain code snippets executed securely by Claude's Code Execution Tool.

## Where and How Skills Are Used

### Claude Web App

- Available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise users.
- Includes built-in Skills for common activities and allows custom Skill creation via a guided “skill-creator.”
- Organizational controls require admin approval for skills used team-wide.

### Claude API

- Available via a new `/v1/skills` endpoint.
- Enables developers to manage Skills programmatically, including versioning.
- Requires enabling the Code Execution Tool beta for Skills that run code.
- Features pre-built Skills (e.g., for Excel, PowerPoint, Word document generation), with support for custom Skills built to specific DevOps or automation needs.

### Claude Code

- Allows teams to install Skills as plugins from a marketplace or manually add them to the Claude environment.
- Claude Agent SDK offers further support for custom Skills in agent-building contexts.

## DevOps and Automation Use Cases

Agent Skills are particularly valuable for:

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Encapsulate templates, standards, and naming conventions in Skills for consistent code generation.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Package pipeline configurations and deployment gates as reusable components.
- **Runbook Automation:** Store operational procedures for reuse during incident response.
- **Compliance and Security:** Embed security checks, compliance patterns, and governance policies.

Skills can be combined for complex scenarios, such as simultaneously applying security, infrastructure, and monitoring requirements to deployment tasks.

## Getting Started

- **Web App:** Enable Skills in settings and use the skill-creator to start packaging workflows.
- **API:** Explore Skill endpoints in API docs and enable the Code Execution Tool as necessary.
- **Claude Code:** Browse and install from the marketplace or create your own for team workflows.

**Security Note:** Only use trusted Skills and sources, as Skills can execute code in Claude's environment.

## Current Limitations and Roadmap

Agent Skills is in early release—large-scale deployment and versioning for enterprises currently requires manual coordination. Expect additional features for centralized management and improved creation workflows as the system matures.

## Conclusion

By explicitly packaging domain knowledge and automation routines, Agent Skills empower teams to streamline AI usage and enforce best practices across different phases of DevOps and software engineering workflows. The shift from prompt-driven to context- and knowledge-driven AI interaction promises greater reliability and control for technical teams.
