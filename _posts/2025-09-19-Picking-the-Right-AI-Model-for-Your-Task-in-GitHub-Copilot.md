# Picking the Right AI Model for Your Task in GitHub Copilot

*By Randy Pagels*

Selecting the right AI model within GitHub Copilot can significantly impact the quality and speed of your code generation workflow. This article explores how to make informed decisions based on task requirements and Copilot plan options.

## Understanding Model Options

GitHub Copilot integrates several AI models, each with unique strengths:

- **Lightweight models** are fast, ideal for quick edits or repetitive code.
- **Advanced models** handle deeper reasoning, longer context, and more complex development tasks.

### Plan-Based Model Availability

The AI models you can access with Copilot depend on your subscription:

- **Free, Pro, Pro+ Plans:**
  - Offer direct choice among available models.
  - Example models: `o3-mini` (fast/small), `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`, `o1-preview` (deeper context).
- **Business, Enterprise Plans:**
  - Model choices are managed by your admin.
  - Common options: `GPT-4.1`, `GPT-5`, `Claude Sonnet 4`.
  - Check with your admin for enabled models if you're uncertain.

## Tips for Effective Model Selection

### 1. Align the Model with Your Task

- For quick, straightforward changes, use a smaller, faster model.
- For features requiring more reasoning or multi-file analysis, choose an advanced model.

### 2. Manual Model Selection (Individual Plans)

Choose a model directly:

- **For simple code:** o3-mini
- **For complex logic/architecture:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1-preview

### 3. Compare Model Outputs

If multiple models are available, try the same prompt with each and evaluate:

- Handling of edge cases
- Clarity and maintainability of code
- Fit with your team’s coding standards

### 4. Watch Request Limits

Premium models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4) may use premium requests, so factor in quota management for Business or Enterprise plans.

## Summary Table: When to Use Each Model

| Task Type         | Recommended Model            |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Boilerplate edits | o3-mini (fastest)            |
| Complex features  | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1-preview|
| Deep reasoning    | GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4|

## Quick Takeaways

- **Business/Enterprise** users should clarify enabled models with admins.
- **Free/Pro** users have more freedom to experiment.
- Pick models based on speed vs. depth trade-offs.
- Monitor usage if premium models are in play.

By matching your Copilot model to the complexity of your work, you’ll reduce retries and move faster from idea to shipped code.
