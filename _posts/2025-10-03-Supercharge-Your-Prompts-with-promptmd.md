Randy Pagels shows how to supercharge developer workflows by using .prompt.md files with GitHub Copilot, making prompts reusable and coding more efficient.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Supercharge Your Prompts with .prompt.md

Posted by Randy Pagels

## Overview

The `.prompt.md` file allows developers to store reusable prompts that guide GitHub Copilot's behavior throughout a code repository. Instead of rewriting guidance or style rules for every session, you can centralize key instructions to maintain consistency and efficiency.

## Why Use .prompt.md?

- **Reusable Prompts:** Define rich, detailed prompts specific to your project or workflow, avoiding repeated manual entry.
- **Consistency:** Keeps documentation, testing, and refactoring processes uniform across teams and contributors.

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Project-Specific Prompts

```markdown
# .prompt.md

## Generate API Docs

Generate documentation for every public function in this repo. Use a markdown format with clear examples.
```

*Copilot can access this to speed up API documentation generation.*

### 2. Automated Testing Prompts

```markdown
# .prompt.md

## Write Unit Tests

For each service, generate Jest tests that cover success and failure paths.
```

*Use this prompt to build solid, consistent unit test coverage across the codebase.*

### 3. Refactoring Prompts

```markdown
# .prompt.md

## Refactor for Clarity

Simplify code without changing functionality. Add inline comments to explain the final version.
```

*Helps maintain code readability and assist teammates taking over sections of code.*

## How to Use Saved Prompts in GitHub Copilot Chat

- Once `.prompt.md` is committed, you can reference prompts directly in Copilot Chat:
  - Use the `#` command to insert a prompt by name (e.g., `#Write Unit Tests`).
  - Browse prompts interactively using the `/` command (e.g., `/Generate API Docs`).
- No need to copy and pasteâ€”your best instructions are always accessible.

## Extra Ideas for Prompt Sections

- **Commit Messages:** Guide contributors to write clear, Conventional Commit messages.
- **Security Reviews:** Instruct Copilot to check files for secrets or unsafe dependencies.
- **UI Components:** Prompt Copilot to generate React components using hooks and TypeScript.

## Key Takeaway

Treat `.prompt.md` as a recipe box for your favorite Copilot prompts. Keep them with your code, call them quickly via `#` or `/`, and maintain a streamlined, repeatable workflow.
