Randy Pagels explains how to use the copilot-instructions.md file to set project-wide rules for GitHub Copilot, helping teams achieve consistency and safer code generation.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Guide Your AI with copilot-instructions.md

Consistency on a development team can be a challenge, especially with code style, naming conventions, documentation formats, and secure coding practices. The `copilot-instructions.md` file helps address these challenges by providing GitHub Copilot with explicit project-specific rules directly in your repository.

## Why Use copilot-instructions.md?

- **Centralizes project standards:** Define naming conventions, documentation requirements, and safe coding practices in one place.
- **Improves Copilot’s suggestions:** Ensures generated code aligns with your team’s established rules without constant prompting.
- **Reduces manual cleanup:** By guiding Copilot, less time is spent fixing inconsistent or risky code.

## Examples of Effective Instructions

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - `Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, and ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES for constants.`
- **Documentation Style:**
  - `Use JSDoc format for function documentation. Each function must include parameters, return type, and one example.`
- **Security & Performance:**
  - `Never log sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, or tokens. Always use async/await for database calls.`

## How To Apply copilot-instructions.md

- Save the file in the `.github` folder at the root of your repository.
- GitHub Copilot will automatically reference the file when generating code suggestions in that repo.
- Update the instructions as your standards evolve; Copilot will use the latest version.

## Advanced Usage Ideas

- **Test Frameworks:** Specify, for example: `Use Jest for unit tests with describe and it blocks.`
- **Formatting Preferences:** Such as: `Use 2 spaces for indentation, no semicolons in JavaScript.`
- **Domain-Specific Conventions:** For React: `Always use function components with hooks.`
- **Combine with .prompt.md:** Use together for both style rules and task-specific generation.

## Quick Takeaway

The `copilot-instructions.md` file acts as a living style guide for your project that GitHub Copilot respects. Define it once, keep it updated, and let Copilot help your whole team stay consistent and secure.
