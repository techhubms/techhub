Nedim’s [recent post](https://medium.com/@nedimhozic/net-aspire-bridging-the-gap-between-application-and-infrastructure-07e94e8e9432) does a great job summarizing what Aspire is today. I want to talk a bit about where we’re headed — and more importantly, *why* we’re building it this way.

## What is Aspire?

Aspire is designed as a platform that provides developers with intuitive abstractions while offering platform engineers and DevOps teams integration points for deeper control and policies. In other words, Aspire aims to:

- Give developers a familiar, application-centric way to describe their apps and dependencies
- Enable platform engineers to enforce policies and manage infrastructure behind the scenes

## The Role of Platform Engineers

Platform engineers are responsible for abstracting and curating cloud provider capabilities (Azure, AWS, GCP) to create secure, cost-controlled, and policy-compliant environments for organizations. Their work involves:

1. Describing policies, capabilities, and constraints for their cloud environments using tools like Terraform, Bicep, or Pulumi
2. Ensuring that developers have a workflow that is both usable and understandable, aligned with organizational requirements

While infrastructure-as-code tools exist for part one, the developer experience around those constraints is still lacking. This is the critical gap Aspire intends to address.

## How Aspire Bridges the Gap

Aspire aims to relieve developers from burdens like:

- Having to know infrastructure specifics (database flavors, subnets, configuration details)
- Learning infrastructure-as-code just to connect services like Redis or PostgreSQL

Instead, developers can:

- Describe their apps via projects, services, containers, endpoints, and references

Platform engineers, on the other hand, can:

- Customize what happens behind high-level calls like `AddRedis()` or `WithReference()`
- Map these abstractions to real infrastructure, configuration, and policy enforcement

Thus, Aspire functions as a bridge between developer intent and platform implementation.

## Relationship with Infrastructure Toolchains

Aspire is **not** meant to replace tools like Pulumi or Terraform.

- These traditional tools excel at describing infrastructure.
- Aspire focuses on describing applications, their dependencies, and relationships.
- Aspire integrates with existing infra tools by generating configuration, environment-specific manifests, and wiring up secrets and connections — starting from the developer’s app perspective.

## Aspire’s Roadmap

Currently, Aspire is centered on improving the local development workflow:

- App modeling
- Spinning up dependencies locally
- Simplifying service discovery and configuration

### Future Directions

Aspire will eventually help you to:

- Define environment-specific behaviors (e.g. what “Redis” means in different stages such as development, testing, and production)
- Generate pipeline and deployment scaffolding from application models
- Support platform-defined components or integrations that wrap infrastructure defaults, policies, and wiring
- Enable full app modeling as code — moving beyond YAML-driven approaches

The long-term goal is to allow you to describe your application **once**, which then shapes:

- Your local development environment
- Your CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Your production deployment

## Conclusion

Aspire is a bet on building better abstractions — not solely to speed up container orchestration, but to close the gap between what developers want to build and what platform teams can safely and reliably offer. The objective is to compress the distance between intent (“I want to add Redis”) and robust reality (“a production-grade, compliant, observable Redis instance available in all environments”).

It’s still early in Aspire’s lifecycle, but the groundwork is in place for a more seamless experience connecting development and operations in the cloud-native world.
