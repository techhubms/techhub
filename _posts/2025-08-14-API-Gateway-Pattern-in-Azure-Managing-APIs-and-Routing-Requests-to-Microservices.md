# API Gateway Pattern in Azure: Managing APIs and Routing Requests to Microservices

Author: Dellenny

## Introduction

In microservices architectures, managing communication between numerous independent services introduces complexity, especially around secure, efficient API exposure. The API Gateway pattern helps address these challenges. On Azure, **Azure API Management (APIM)** provides a powerful, managed gateway solution.

## What is the API Gateway Pattern?

- Acts as a single entry point ('front door') to various internal microservices
- Handles routing, transformation, security, and aggregation for API calls
- Simplifies client interaction, reduces direct coupling to microservices, and enforces security and policy control centrally

### Key Responsibilities

- **Routing**: Direct requests to correct backend microservice
- **Transformation**: Adapt payloads/responses between clients and services
- **Security**: Apply authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0, JWT, subscription keys)
- **Aggregation**: Merge responses from multiple services if needed

## Why Use Azure API Management as an API Gateway?

Azure APIM enables:

- Centralized API administration (publish, monitor, control, secure APIs)
- Traffic control (rate limiting, throttling)
- Centralized security enforcement
- Analytics (usage metrics, logging via Azure Monitor)
- Payload transformation (JSON/XML)

This provides a maintainable and scalable approach for exposing, securing, and monitoring APIs.

## How the API Gateway Pattern Works in Azure

### 1. Clients Connect to APIM Endpoint

All external clients (web, mobile, partner apps) send requests to APIM, rather than individual microservice URLs.
Example:

```
https://api.contoso.com/orders
```

### 2. APIM Routes Requests via API Configurations

APIM's routing logic sends each request to the appropriate backend service:

- `GET /orders` → Orders microservice
- `POST /customers` → Customers microservice

### 3. Policies Enable Transformation & Enforcement

Policies (defined in XML) are applied:

- **Inbound**: Pre-processing requests (validation, rewriting, authentication)
- **Backend**: Communications between APIM and services
- **Outbound**: Post-processing responses (formatting, transformation)

Example Policy:

```xml
<inbound>
  <set-backend-service base-url="https://orders-service.azurewebsites.net" />
  <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" />
</inbound>
```

### 4. Security and Governance

- Apply OAuth 2.0/JWT without updating each microservice
- Centralized rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Track requests and responses via Azure Monitor & Application Insights

## Typical Architecture Flow

1. **Client Request** → APIM
2. **Policy Execution**: Auth, logging, payload transformation
3. **Routing**: To backend microservice
4. **Aggregation**: Combine data if needed
5. **Unified Response**: Back to client

Diagram:

```
[ Clients ] → [ Azure API Management ] → [ Microservices ]
```

## Best Practices for API Gateways in Azure

- Use versioning in API paths (e.g., `/v1/orders`) for stability
- Keep gateways stateless—store session/state in backends
- Monitor and alert via Azure Monitor & Application Insights
- Minimize payload transformations for performance
- Use caching in APIM for common data

## Conclusion

The API Gateway pattern using Azure API Management offers centralized security, routing, and management for microservices APIs. It shields backend microservices, streamlines client integration, and enforces robust governance. For complex architectures, this pattern helps make systems scalable, maintainable, and secure—much like providing a central 'cashier' for your microservices 'food court.'
