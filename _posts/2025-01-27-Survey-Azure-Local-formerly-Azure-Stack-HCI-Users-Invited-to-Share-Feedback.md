### Key Technologies

- **Azure Local:** Formerly Azure Stack HCI, a hybrid cloud infrastructure offering from Microsoft for running Azure services on-premises.
- **AKS Arc:** Azure Kubernetes Service enabled by Azure Arc, allowing customers to run managed Kubernetes clusters in diverse environments, including on-premises with Azure Local.

### Participation

- **No prior Kubernetes experience required:** The survey is designed for a broad range of users, from those new to Kubernetes to experienced operators.
- **Feedback focus:** Questions will likely cover both usability and technical aspects of AKS Arc on Azure Local.
