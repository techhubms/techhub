# HoundDog.ai Code Scanner Shifts Data Privacy Responsibility Left

**Author:** Mike Vizard  

## Overview

HoundDog.ai has announced the general availability of its static code scanning tool, designed to empower security and privacy teams to enforce robust data guardrails during software developmentâ€”especially where projects interact with AI models and LLM prompts. This approach is focused on shifting responsibility for privacy and compliance 'left,' allowing issues to be detected and addressed during the coding process, rather than post-deployment.

## Key Features

- **Static Code Scanning:** Detects and flags sensitive data embedded in LLM prompts and other AI data sinks such as logs and temporary files.
- **IDE and CI Integration:** Extensions available for VS Code, JetBrains, and Eclipse, supporting real-time scanning and pre-merge checks in CI pipelines.
- **DevSecOps Enablement:** Emphasizes privacy by design by empowering development teams to handle privacy concerns as they work.
- **Sensitive Data Detection:** Identifies over 150 types of sensitive data (PII, PHI, CHD, authentication tokens) and traces their use across codebases, including risky integrations into LLMs and AI models.
- **Compliance and Reporting:** Generates audit-ready reports, maps data flows, and supports RoPA and Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) tailored to frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA.

## How It Works

- **Blocking Unsafe Changes:** Can block pull requests with unapproved or unsafe changes to ensure ongoing compliance.
- **Comprehensive Visibility:** Captures direct and indirect usage of AI tools, SDKs, and open-source frameworks, providing greater transparency in AI integrations (e.g., through tools like OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain).
- **Shadow AI Detection:** Finds previously undiscovered or undocumented AI tool usage in codebases.

## DevOps and Data Privacy Alignment

HoundDog.ai enables DevSecOps teams to:

- Proactively address privacy and security risks by embedding data governance in the DevOps pipeline.
- Minimize risk of data leaks through early detection, reducing reliance on post-production remediation (e.g., DLP workflows).
- Maintain compliance readiness with continuously updated documentation and privacy assessments.

## Industry Implications

As application development increasingly embeds AI, the need for detailed data flow mapping, audit reporting, and direct integration of privacy controls into the coding process becomes critical. HoundDog.ai's solution targets this need by bridging gaps traditionally left open by runtime-only security tools.
