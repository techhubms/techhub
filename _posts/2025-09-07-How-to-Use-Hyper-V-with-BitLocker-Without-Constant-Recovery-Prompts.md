Dellenny provides a practical guide on resolving repeated BitLocker recovery prompts when using Hyper-V on Windows, detailing secure setup and TPM configuration strategies.<!--excerpt_end-->

# How to Use Hyper-V with BitLocker Without Constant Recovery Prompts

Enabling **Hyper-V** on a BitLocker-protected Windows machine can cause repeated demands for your BitLocker recovery key. This behavior, although frustrating for developers and IT pros, is by design: BitLocker carefully checks your system’s boot state for tampering.

## Why Does Hyper-V Trigger BitLocker Recovery?

- **BitLocker** uses the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to verify your system state at boot.
- Enabling or disabling Hyper-V changes boot configuration, which the TPM interprets as a change, triggering the recovery prompt.
- Other virtualization or security features—like Credential Guard, Device Guard, or Secure Boot changes—can also trigger this behavior.

## Preventing Constant Recovery Prompts

### 1. Suspend BitLocker Before Enabling Hyper-V

To smoothly add Hyper-V to your baseline configuration:

```powershell
manage-bde -protectors -disable C:
```

- Enable Hyper-V via Windows Features or PowerShell.
- Reboot.
- Re-enable BitLocker protection:

```powershell
manage-bde -protectors -enable C:
```

This process lets BitLocker recognize Hyper-V as normal.

### 2. Avoid Toggling Hyper-V Frequently

- If you use Hyper-V, keep it enabled consistently.
- If you rarely use it, disable it and consider alternatives like WSL2 with Virtual Machine Platform (which avoids the full Hyper-V hypervisor).

### 3. (Advanced) Change TPM PCR Bindings

BitLocker’s default binding (PCR 11) includes the hypervisor. To prevent changes triggering recovery prompts, you can exclude PCR 11:

```powershell
manage-bde -protectors -delete C: -type TPM
manage-bde -protectors -add C: -tpm -PCRList 0,2,4
```

*Note: This trades some security for convenience; recommended only for non-production/dev systems.*

### 4. Safely Store Your Recovery Key

Always keep your BitLocker recovery key accessible via your Microsoft account, a USB drive, or enterprise directory. This ensures you are never locked out.

### 5. For WSL2 Users

If you only need Hyper-V for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2), you can just enable the **Virtual Machine Platform** component. This often avoids unnecessary BitLocker prompts.

## One-Time Setup Workflow

1. Suspend BitLocker.
2. Enable Hyper-V.
3. Reboot.
4. Resume BitLocker.
5. Keep Hyper-V consistently enabled.

This way, BitLocker recognizes Hyper-V as part of your standard system state.

## Conclusion

BitLocker safeguarding against unauthorized changes is good security practice. By following these configuration steps, you can use BitLocker and Hyper-V together without disruptive recovery key requests.
