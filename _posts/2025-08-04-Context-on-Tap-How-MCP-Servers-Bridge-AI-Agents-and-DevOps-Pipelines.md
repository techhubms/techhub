# Context on Tap: How MCP Servers Bridge AI Agents and DevOps Pipelines

**Author:** Mike Vizard

---

Large language models (LLMs) and AI agents are increasingly capable of drafting code and moving artifacts within the software development lifecycle. However, their lack of situational awareness often leads to fundamental errors. Glenn Weinstein, CEO of Cloudsmith, discusses with Mike Vizard how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is quickly becoming an essential part of modern DevOps pipelines to address these issues.

## What is an MCP Server?

Weinstein describes the MCP server as a "receptionist for AI agents," providing critical context needed for intelligent decision-making. For example, MCP servers can answer questions like “Which Docker images are in my repository?” or provide other environment-specific details that AI models would otherwise guess or miss. This empowers AI agents to work with up-to-date and specific information, reducing the risk of errors.

## Beyond Context: Chaining AI Agents

Today’s developers are increasingly chaining AI agents to execute complex, multi-step jobs—such as pulling a package, scanning it, and then publishing it—without requiring human intervention. For these chains to function smoothly, secure agent-to-agent (A2A) protocols are crucial. These protocols allow bots to call each other without repetitive authentication hurdles. The industry's convergence toward open standards—reflected in Google's recent donation of A2A protocols to the Linux Foundation—illustrates the rapid evolution of this ecosystem.

## Scaling Pipelines: Artifact Storage Challenges

With more context-aware and interconnected AI agents, the frequency of software builds is skyrocketing—sometimes reaching hundreds of builds daily. Weinstein warns this surge could create bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines, especially if artifact storage solutions can’t scale. Development teams used to nightly builds and releases may be forced to adapt as AI pushes the cadence from once daily to potentially once hourly, requiring global package repositories and active caching strategies.

## Supply Chain Considerations and Security

There is also a rising concern over supply chain security. AI agents prone to hallucinations may suggest nonexistent or obsolete packages. To mitigate this, artifact managers now need to function as control planes—tracking software provenance, scanning for vulnerabilities, and rejecting spoofed or suspicious package names. These steps have become the final checkpoint prior to production deployments, playing a vital role in defending against supply chain attacks.

## Adapting for the Next Generation

Weinstein’s core message is clear: while experimenting with AI copilots is critical today, organizations must elevate expectations for the interoperability of every tool in the stack. Future-ready platforms must expose their data through MCP endpoints and integrate seamlessly with AI agents to avoid obsolescence. Teams are urged to proactively audit their APIs and contextual data sources, anticipating that the next generation of developers will treat AI companions—and the contextual plumbing that supports them—as fundamental requirements.

## Key Takeaways

- **MCP servers** provide essential situational context for AI agents, reducing errors and inefficiencies.
- **A2A protocols** enable secure, multi-agent workflows within DevOps pipelines.
- **CI/CD scaling** is a growing challenge as AI drives higher build frequencies and demands more from artifact repositories.
- **Supply chain security** requires artifact managers to verify provenance and protect against hallucinated packages or vulnerabilities.
- **Future-proofing development stacks** means integrating MCP endpoints and preparing for AI-first development cultures.

> “If a platform can’t expose its data through an MCP endpoint and play nicely with agents, it will feel ancient in a year. Start mapping where context lives, audit your APIs and assume that the next generation of developers will treat AI companions as a given. Your pipelines should be ready before they arrive.”
