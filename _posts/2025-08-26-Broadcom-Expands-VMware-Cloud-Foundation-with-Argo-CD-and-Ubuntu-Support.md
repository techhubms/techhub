# Broadcom Expands VMware Cloud Foundation with Argo CD and Ubuntu Support

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Broadcom announced at VMware Explore 2025 several significant enhancements to its VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform, increasing focus on developer experience, operational efficiency, and unified management for enterprise IT.

## Key Announcements

- **Argo CD Integration:** VCF now embeds Argo as a continuous delivery (CD) tool for Kubernetes, enabling GitOps workflows for application deployment and infrastructure automation.
- **Expanded Ubuntu and Canonical Partnership:** VCF gains enterprise-grade support for deployments running atop Ubuntu, including new Chiseled Ubuntu containers. These containers remove unnecessary components for faster download, reduced storage, and faster startup times.
- **Accelerated AI Workload Support:** With Canonical, Broadcom is rolling out precompiled GPU drivers, improving efficiency for AI and machine learning tasks on VCF.
- **New Developer Services:** vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) within VCF adds support for Istio service mesh, Postgres and MySQL databases, and hardened containers through the VCF Advanced Cyber Compliance add-on.

## Strategic Positioning

- **Shift Toward Kubernetes and DevOps:** With VMware's acquisition, Broadcom is aligning VCF more closely with containerized application deployment on Kubernetes. This contrasts VMware Tanzu, now focusing on Cloud Foundry (PaaS).
- **Unified Management:** The goal is to help organizations support both VM and container-based workloads, unifying infrastructure and application operations.
- **Platform Engineering Alignment:** Broadcom aims to streamline how enterprises manage application environments at scale, echoing platform engineering trends.

## Business Impact

- **Adoption:** Despite licensing changes and some customer churn, Broadcom reports robust revenues and continued faith from large organizations such as Walmart, which will standardize its virtual infrastructure management on VCF, providing developers access to Kubernetes clusters.
- **DevOps Evolution:** The updates indicate a trend where DevOps teams, now tasked with more infrastructure management, benefit from unified tools combining agility and centralized control.
