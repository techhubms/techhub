# Top GitHub Copilot Shortcuts and Productivity Tips for VS Code

**By John Edward**

GitHub Copilot is more than just an autocomplete plugin—it's an AI pair programmer designed to enhance how you write code in Visual Studio Code. Mastering Copilot means understanding essential shortcuts, leveraging advanced features, and adopting practical review habits.

## Essential Shortcuts for Maximum Productivity

- **Accept Suggestion:** Use the Tab key to accept Copilot's inline suggestion instantly.
- **Cycle Suggestions:** Press `Alt + ]` (Windows/Linux) or `Option + ]` (Mac) to view alternative suggestions. Don’t settle for the default—explore options for more idiomatic or accurate code.

## Using Copilot Chat

Copilot Chat elevates support for complex or high-level coding tasks:

- **Open Main Chat View:** `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows/Mac/Linux) opens the persistent chat panel for ongoing usage and multi-step requests.
- **Start Inline Chat:** `Ctrl + I` opens a chat box right at your cursor, perfect for contextual queries or quick edits.

## Slash Commands and Advanced Prompting

- Slash commands (`/`) in the chat allow quick actions by directing Copilot. Example: `/fix #selection` applies to code you've highlighted.
- Use context tags:
  - `#selection`: Current selection.
  - `#file`: Active file.
  - `#codebase`: Whole codebase (available in Enterprise/Business).

Combining slash commands and context tags can pinpoint Copilot's AI to specific parts of your project.

## Productivity Tips for Getting the Most out of Copilot

1. **Add Context:** Keep relevant files open in your workspace. The more context Copilot sees, the better its suggestions.
2. **Write Descriptive Comments:** Clear, human-readable comments prompt better results.
   - Bad: `// make a loop`
   - Good: `// Loop through the 'users' array and filter out any user objects where 'isActive' is false, then return the remaining users.`
3. **Use Chat Mentions:** Employ `#selection`, `#file`, and `#codebase` to help Copilot focus its advice.
4. **Break Down Complex Tasks (Agent Mode):** Large features are best tackled using Agent mode in Chat View—it can generate plans and operate across multiple files.
5. **Always Review Copilot’s Output:** Review code for correctness, security, and style. Copilot provides strong first drafts but is not infallible.

## Conclusion

Adopting Copilot in your workflow means going beyond shortcuts—embrace the chat interfaces, context features, and diligent review habits. With these techniques, you’ll turn Copilot into a true coding accelerator.
