# Eclipse Foundation Launches OCCTET Toolkit for CRA Compliance

The Eclipse Foundation has introduced the Open Source Compliance: Comprehensive Techniques and Essential Tools (OCCTET) project, designed to aid organizations—particularly smaller entities—in meeting new cybersecurity regulations set by the European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

## Key Aspects of the OCCTET Toolkit

- **CRA Compliance Checklist**: A compiled list of requirements to satisfy CRA obligations.
- **Conformity Assessment Specifications**: Documentation and methodologies for organizations to demonstrate compliance.
- **Automated Evaluation Methods and Tools**: Solutions to streamline and automate compliance workflows.
- **Federated Assessment Database**: Repository for publishing assessments of open source software components.
- **Dependency Analysis Inventories**: Catalogs of compatible automatic dependency analysis tools.
- **Reporting Tool**: Generate documentation and compliance evidence for regulatory audits.

The CRA, coming into effect by September 2026, applies to all digital products—including open source software—sold or distributed in the EU. The regulation aims to increase cybersecurity standards and resilience for manufacturers, software vendors, and open source maintainers. The toolkit provides a structured path to continuous compliance, helping organizations avoid liability and maintain their operations within the European market.

## Industry-Wide Collaboration

The Eclipse Foundation has established an Open Regulatory Compliance (ORC) Working Group, which includes more than 50 organizations such as Microsoft, GitHub, Red Hat, Nokia, Google, and Mercedes-Benz. These collaborations reflect the industry's focus on scalable, shared compliance strategies.

## Impact and Outlook

Thabang Mashologu (Eclipse Foundation VP) notes that OCCTET is relevant for organizations of all sizes, providing a sustainable framework for both immediate and long-term compliance needs. There is potential for the CRA to become a model for global cybersecurity regulations due to its comprehensive scope.

While the new regulations may drive some organizations to reconsider their European operations, the overall effect is expected to enhance cybersecurity by making compliance more accessible and raising the bar for digital product security industry-wide.
