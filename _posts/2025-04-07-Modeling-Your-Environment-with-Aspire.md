# Modeling Your Environment with Aspire

**Author:** David Fowler

When modeling with Aspire, the goal is to describe your application and its environment in a format both humans and tools can understand. While it might seem straightforward to catalog services, databases, and frontends, real-world applications are often more complex. Critical operational details often remain undocumented—relegated to README files, environment variable exports, Slack discussions, or individual team members’ memories.

## The Need for Explicit Contracts

Fowler asks: _Where is the explicit contract for what an application needs to execute?_

- What environment variables are required?
- What command-line arguments?
- What protocols connect services?
- What are the specifics of connection strings (e.g., Redis: format, authentication)?

Often, this information is only known implicitly by the team, not represented in a structured or tool-friendly way.

## What Aspire Changes

Aspire provides a structured, programmable approach to modeling the shape, dependencies, and assumptions of your application environment. By capturing these details explicitly, Aspire enables tools to automate routine tasks, validate environments, and minimize errors.

### Contract-First Philosophy

Drawing parallels to OpenAPI or Protobuf, Fowler describes how Aspire brings contract-first thinking to application topology. Instead of just stating "this app needs Redis," developers specify:

- The kind of Redis service
- Connection details
- Expected behaviors and environment-specific configurations

This approach:

- Establishes a single source of truth
- Serves as a contract for platform teams
- Provides a tool-friendly model that can be validated and transformed

Just as API schemas enabled automated client generation and testing, Aspire unlocks automation in infrastructure and deployment.

## Practical Example: Simple and Complex Scenarios

**Simple Example:**

- _Setup_: JavaScript frontend, C# backend, PostgreSQL database
- _Development_: Local PostgreSQL container
- _Production_: External PostgreSQL managed by another team, accessed through a connection string

**Aspire enables you to:**

- Model both setups identically within your application graph
- Allow clear, inspectable dependencies (frontend → backend → database)
- Automate environment-specific wiring, credentials, and connections

**Complex Scenario:**

- React frontend, C# API backend, Redis cache, background worker, shared PostgreSQL, external payment (e.g. Stripe), centralized observability

- _Development_: Containers for Redis/Postgres, local Aspire dashboard, Stripe mock
- _Production/Staging_: Managed Redis, external Postgres, integrated telemetry, real Stripe with secret management

All are modeled as resources, clearly defined in the environment setup and resolved at publish time. Developers can build/test locally as if all resources are present, yet production deployments happen with real (and potentially externally-managed) infrastructure, without changing configuration files or causing runtime surprises.

## Aspire Integrates with Existing Infrastructure

You do not need to rewrite your application to use Aspire. It's designed to wrap and model existing infrastructure seamlessly. Aspire can:

- Wrap existing services and APIs as external resources
- Integrate with current configuration and secret-management systems
- Represent hosted resources managed by other teams
- Extend to custom deployment via publishers

This flexibility is valuable for both new projects (greenfield) and modernization or stabilization of legacy systems. Incremental adoption is encouraged—start by modeling known components and evolve from there.

## Modeling is the Foundation

Explicit modeling is merely the first step. Aspire aims to make assembling applications intuitive—snapping together components for common patterns like caches, databases, frontends, and message queues with minimal effort but clear, structured intent.

The more structure you model, the more tooling can automate setup, validation, and deployment.

## The Importance of Modeling

By modeling your application:

- You create a transparent contract with required infrastructure
- You unlock automation and validation in tooling (Aspire knows what to start, connect, and check for correctness)
- You reduce onboarding friction (clearer documentation/expectations for new team members)
- Your system becomes inspectable—tools, platforms, and even AI solutions can understand and manipulate it

Aspire helps teams move from tribal knowledge and guesswork to systems that are explicit, reliable, and automatable.

Future posts from Fowler will delve into how this approach improves developer experience, publishing, and platform integration.
