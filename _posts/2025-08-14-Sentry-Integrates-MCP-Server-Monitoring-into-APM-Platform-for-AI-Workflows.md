# Sentry Adds Tool for Monitoring MCP Servers to APM Platform

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Sentry has expanded its application performance monitoring (APM) platform with a new capability designed to monitor Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This enhancement directly targets the growing needs of DevOps and AI engineering teams as AI applications become more prevalent.

## What is MCP?

MCP, originally developed by Anthropic, has quickly become a standard for connecting AI applications to their necessary data sources. As AI-powered solutions are integrated into more products and workflows, MCP servers function as a bridge between AI models and live data, facilitating context sharing and application state between independent processes.

## What Did Sentry Add?

- **New MCP Server Monitoring tool:**
  - Integrates with Sentry’s APM platform using a JavaScript SDK.
  - Allows DevOps teams to monitor deployed MCP servers, providing visibility into traffic, client usage, performance bottlenecks, and failure points.
  - Enables tracking of which tools are invoked most frequently, diagnosing slow or faulty operations, and pinpointing root causes via input analysis.

## Why Does This Matter for DevOps and AI Engineering?

- **Operational Efficiency:** As more AI apps depend on MCP, having real-time monitoring helps teams debug and optimize workflows.
- **Scalability:** MCP’s model allows organizations to reduce ad hoc integrations and standardize the way external data is fed to AI agents.
- **Security Implications:** Centralizing business logic and application state in MCP servers increases their potential as attack targets. Monitoring and observability become crucial for detecting threats and enforcing DevSecOps principles.
- **Workflow Integration:** DevOps pipelines and processes may need adjustment to account for MCP, but the unified monitoring approach mitigates complexity.

## Technical Insights

- **MCP is application-layer, carried over HTTP/S, and accessed via API calls.**
- **Unlike stateless protocols, MCP includes application context, state, and intent in its payloads.**
- **Monitoring tools provide crucial insights for teams deploying autonomous AI agents, allowing for continuous integration, deployment, and security hardening.**

## Security and DevSecOps

- MCP’s central role in AI data flow introduces new attack surfaces.
- Monitoring enables early detection of compromises within processes or workflows.
- Organizations implementing MCP must ensure robust observability as part of their AI and DevOps strategy.

## Conclusion

The adoption of MCP is expected to rise with AI-driven applications, making robust monitoring and observability tools an essential requirement. Sentry’s MCP monitoring serves as an example of how the DevOps toolchain is evolving to meet new challenges at the intersection of software delivery, AI, and security.
