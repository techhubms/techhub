# Using GitHub Copilot for Multiple Tasks in Parallel

Author: Harald Binkle
Posted: October 1, 2025

## Unlocking Parallelism with GitHub Copilot

The traditional developer workflow is often sequential—one prompt or task at a time. This article demonstrates how you can break free from that pattern and instead leverage GitHub Copilot, Copilot CLI, and the Copilot coding agent to work on multiple independent tasks in parallel, resulting in faster project delivery and improved productivity.

### Key Benefits

- **Boosted productivity** by handling several independent coding tasks at once
- **Efficient bootstrapping** for new projects covering setup, documentation, and automation
- **Better focus** on design and decision-making while automation handles repetitive tasks

## Real-World Example: Bootstrapping a New Project

Typical to-do list for a new project:

- Scaffold the project file structure (source code folders, configs)
- Add essential files: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, etc.
- Implement initial logic or core features
- Write Copilot-specific instructions
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- Create documentation

Many of these tasks are independent. With Copilot tools, you don’t need to do them one after another.

## How to Run Copilot Tools in Parallel

### 1. Scaffold Your Project

Use Copilot chat in your editor to generate starter folders and essential files. For example, context-aware prompts can even generate `copilot-instructions` files.

### 2. Set Up Copilot CLI

Install GitHub Copilot CLI if you haven’t already:

```sh
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
```

Start a Copilot CLI session:

```sh
copilot
```

### 3. Use Multiple Terminals

Open several terminal windows and launch separate Copilot CLI sessions in each. Assign different tasks to each session (e.g., one generates `README.md`, another produces the `LICENSE`). Each session works independently, so tasks can proceed in parallel.

### 4. Commit Early and Often

Once the project structure is up, make an initial commit and push to GitHub. Early commits allow for automation and smooth team collaboration.

### 5. Use the Copilot Coding Agent

For automation tasks like setting up GitHub Actions workflows, delegate to the Copilot coding agent. The coding agent runs asynchronously on GitHub, enabling background work while you continue locally.

### 6. Work in Parallel

While Copilot CLI and the coding agent handle their tasks, you can use Copilot chat for further development or implementations, bug fixes, and enhancements.

## Four Copilots for One Developer

A developer can coordinate up to four simultaneous Copilot tools:

- Multiple Copilot CLI sessions (one per terminal)
- Copilot chat in the editor
- Copilot coding agent for asynchronous background tasks

This allows you to divide your workload, speed up delivery, and maintain focus on complex or strategic aspects of your project.

## Try It Yourself!

Next time you start a new project, split your work into discrete, independent tasks. Open several terminals, launch Copilot CLI sessions, and empower Copilot agents to handle the repetitive work—all in parallel. See how much more efficiently you can deliver results.

*How many Copilots can you coordinate at once? Share your experience with the community!*
