# Automating Virtual Desktops in Windows 11 with PowerShell and Command-Line Tools

**Author:** Dellenny

Windows 11 improves virtual desktop functionality, giving users more ways to organize workflows. This guide targets those looking to automate desktop creation, switching, and management using scripting and command-line approaches.

## Why Automate Virtual Desktops?

Automating virtual desktops saves time and optimizes workspace setup for different contexts:

- Launch a "Work" desktop with required apps already running
- Bind hotkeys to specific desktops
- Reorganize windows at startup
- Integrate desktop management with broader productivity scripts

## Core Challenge

Windows 11 lacks native command-line tools for virtual desktop management, but combining **PowerShell**, community modules, and third-party utilities overcomes this gap.

## Automation Strategies

### 1. Using the VirtualDesktop PowerShell Module

- Install the module:  

  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name VirtualDesktop -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

- Import for use:  

  ```powershell
  Import-Module VirtualDesktop
  ```

- Core commands:
    - **Create new desktop:**

      ```powershell
      New-Desktop
      ```

    - **List desktops:**

      ```powershell
      Get-Desktop
      ```

    - **Switch desktops:**

      ```powershell
      (Get-Desktop | Select-Object -First 1).Switch()
      ```

    - **Move window between desktops:**

      ```powershell
      Move-WindowToDesktop -Desktop (Get-Desktop | Select-Object -Last 1)
      ```

    - **Rename desktops:**

      ```powershell
      (Get-Desktop)[0].Name = "Work"
      (Get-Desktop)[1].Name = "Research"
      ```

    - **Remove a desktop:**

      ```powershell
      (Get-Desktop | Select-Object -Last 1).Remove()
      ```

These can all be combined in scripts for startup automation or rapid task switching.

### 2. Command-Line with VirtualDesktopCmd

Use [VirtualDesktopCmd](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopCmd) for purely command-line operations:

```cmd
VirtualDesktopCmd.exe /create
VirtualDesktopCmd.exe /switch:2
VirtualDesktopCmd.exe /remove:3
```

Integrate these commands into batch files, PowerShell, or link them to hotkeys for hands-free desktop management.

### 3. Advanced Automation with AutoHotkey

For granular control, use AutoHotkey scripts with the appropriate library:

```autohotkey
# Include VirtualDesktop.ahk

; Ctrl + Alt + N: create desktop
^!n::VD_Create()

; Ctrl + Alt + Right: next desktop
^!Right::VD_Next()

; Ctrl + Alt + Left: prev desktop
^!Left::VD_Prev()
```

Combine these with startup scripts and your system always boots to a preferred desktop layout.

## Configure for Startup

- Write your PowerShell automation as a `.ps1` file
- Add to Task Scheduler set to "Run at startup" for persistent configuration

## Conclusion

Though Windows doesn't natively allow command-line virtual desktop management, PowerShell modules, tools like VirtualDesktopCmd, and scripting with AutoHotkey provide powerful automation options. Automate your workspace for better efficiency and a more dynamic Windows experience.
