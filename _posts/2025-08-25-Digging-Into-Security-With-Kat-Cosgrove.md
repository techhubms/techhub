# Digging Into Security With Kat Cosgrove

*Featuring Kat Cosgrove (Head of Developer Advocacy at Minimus) and Matt Stratton (Solution Architect at Turbot)*

## Overview

In this episode of the Arrested DevOps podcast, Kat Cosgrove and Matty Stratton take a deep, practical look at security’s critical—and often stressful—role in modern DevOps. The discussion covers:

- Why container vulnerabilities are always appearing and how teams can realistically keep up.
- Techniques for responding to recurring security issues without falling into panic.
- The complex work of securing Kubernetes and containerized environments, with a clear recognition that there isn’t a “magic fix.”
- The importance of fostering an effective security culture amid constantly evolving threats.
- The realities professionals face, like having to patch the same vulnerability multiple times, and the relatable frustration of dealing with persistent CVEs.

## Key Takeaways

- **Vulnerabilities are a constant:** Teams must expect and plan for ongoing discovery of security issues in containers and dependencies.
- **Proactive response is critical:** Building processes to react efficiently—without panic—is essential for both security and sanity.
- **Securing cloud native environments is complex:** There’s no simple solution; layered, ongoing effort is necessary.
- **Security culture matters:** Tools are only as useful as the team’s commitment and practices around them.
- **Humor helps manage stress:** Recognizing the stressful and sometimes absurd aspects of security work makes the challenges more manageable.

## Practical Insights

- Patch management is ongoing—there’s rarely a final “fix.”
- Recognize security as an organization-wide concern, not just a specialized team’s job.
- Foster open dialogues about security to avoid blame and encourage learning from incidents.
- Invest in automating vulnerability scanning and remediation where possible.
