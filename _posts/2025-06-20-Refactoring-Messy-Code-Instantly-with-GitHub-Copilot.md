# Refactoring Messy Code Instantly with GitHub Copilot

*Posted by Randy Pagels on Jul 11, 2025*

Refactoring legacy or "spaghetti" code can be burdensome for developers. In this guide, Randy Pagels demonstrates how to leverage GitHub Copilot to transform messy code into clean, maintainable solutions quickly, using targeted AI refactoring prompts.

## Why Use GitHub Copilot for Refactoring?

GitHub Copilot goes beyond auto-completing code. Its AI-driven chat functionality can suggest cleaner, more efficient, and readable alternatives to your existing code, making refactoring less tedious and more productive.

## Getting Started: Cleaning Up Your Code with Copilot

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Highlight the Code:** Select the portion of code you want to refactor.
2. **Prompt Copilot:** Add a clear comment above the code, such as:

   ```python
   # Refactor this function to be more readable and efficient
   ```

3. **Invoke Copilot Chat:** Press `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac) to activate GitHub Copilot Chat.
4. **Review Suggestions:** Copilot will generate a refactored, optimized version of your code. Review its suggestions and apply as needed.

### Example: Before and After

**Original Function (Before):**

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        if 'price' in item and 'quantity' in item:
            total += item['price'] * item['quantity']
    return total
```

**After Copilot Refactor:**

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items if 'price' in item and 'quantity' in item)
```

The updated code is more readable (Pythonic), eliminates boilerplate, and maintains clarity.

## Quick Takeaway

When facing messy code, don't get bogged down in manual rewrites. Use GitHub Copilot's chat to quickly receive refactoring suggestions. With a simple comment and keypress, you can transform unwieldy logic into clean, maintainable code.
