# Why Automation Fails Without the Right QA Mindset

*By Imtiaz Shaik*

Modern DevOps practices enable faster release cycles and continuous delivery, but solely depending on test automation can result in overlooked quality issues. This article dives into why a strong QA mindset is essential for achieving both speed and quality in software development.

## QA's Role in the DevOps Lifecycle

- In DevOps, QA must shift from checking software at the end stages to acting as quality enablers throughout the entire delivery process.
- Close collaboration with product owners, developers, and architects ensures quality is integrated from initial requirements through deployment.
- Early QA involvement helps design maintainable, risk-based automated tests that address both expected and unexpected scenarios.

## The Limits of Automation

- Automation speeds up delivery — up to 60% faster — but can miss critical defects if not driven by an intentional QA mindset.
- Research shows 63% of organizations deploy code without thorough testing, sacrificing quality for speed.
- Automated scripts often focus on code coverage or predefined outcomes, missing user experience issues, business logic failures, and edge cases.

## Benefits of a QA Mindset

- QA professionals bring curiosity, risk-awareness, and strategic thinking.
- Tests are prioritized not just by functionality but by potential business impact and risk.
- Human-driven scenarios catch issues that automation overlooks, including misaligned requirements, complex business logic, or regulatory needs.
- A QA mindset fosters creative, adaptable strategies like modular automation to withstand changing codebases and UI elements.

## Human Testing is Still Essential

- Human QA is particularly valuable for:
    - UI/UX validation
    - Exploratory testing
    - Integration and real-world scenario testing
- Combining automated and manual testing ensures fast feedback without sacrificing coverage of new features or unexpected behaviors.
- Example: In a payroll system upgrade, automation maintained regression coverage, while humans validated integration and novel scenarios.

## Strengthening Your QA Mindset

To succeed with automation in DevOps, teams should:

- Integrate QA from the beginning of each project.
- Use risk-based, user-focused testing to identify high-impact issues early.
- Maintain adaptable, resilient test automation scripts.
- Blend automation and human insight to achieve broad and deep quality coverage.

## Conclusion

Tooling and automation are important, but human insight, proactive QA strategies, and ongoing collaboration are the real drivers of software quality in DevOps environments. Successful teams design their automation programs around curiosity, business value, and continuous improvement.
