# Confirmation Dialogs with Htmx and SweetAlert

When building web experiences, distinguishing between safe and destructive user actions is critical. For potentially dangerous actions (like deleting data), it's common practice to seek user confirmation before proceeding.

This guide explores a feature from the [Htmx documentation](https://htmx.org/events/#htmx:confirm) allowing interception of outgoing requests and presentation of a [SweetAlert confirmation dialog](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/). This technique increases UX control and enhances user trust.

## Understanding the `htmx:confirm` Event

Htmx provides the `hx-confirm` attribute for declarative confirmation dialogs:

```html
<button class="btn btn-danger" hx-post="" name="input" value="DELETE" hx-confirm="Are you sure?">
  Delete Important Stuff
</button>
```

This invokes the browser's native `confirm` dialog, giving users a final choice before a destructive operation.

Lesser known is the `htmx:confirm` event: it triggers **before every Htmx request**, allowing developers to intercept, halt, or programmatically continue any client action—enabling advanced UX possibilities.

To register for this event, add the following JavaScript to your app:

```javascript
// Intercept every htmx confirmation
document.body.addEventListener('htmx:confirm', function (evt) {
  // evt.preventDefault() to halt
  // evt.detail.issueRequest() to proceed
});
```

Now let’s improve on the default, basic dialog.

## Integrating SweetAlert for Modern Confirmation Dialogs

You can replace standard confirm dialogs with SweetAlert modals for better clarity, branding, and UX. Here’s how:

1. **Add SweetAlert to your web application**

   ```html
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/sweetalert/dist/sweetalert.min.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Mark elements needing modals for destructive actions**

   ```html
   <button class="btn btn-danger" hx-post="" name="input" value="DELETE" confirm-with-sweet-alert='true'>
     Delete Important Stuff
   </button>
   ```
   
   The `confirm-with-sweet-alert` attribute is optional—use it if you want to selectively apply SweetAlert only to certain actions. Otherwise, the event handler can intercept all requests globally.

3. **Write an event handler for selective confirmation**

   ```javascript
   // site.js
   document.body.addEventListener('htmx:confirm', function (evt) {
     if (evt.target.matches("[confirm-with-sweet-alert='true']")) {
       evt.preventDefault();
       swal({
         title: "Are you sure?",
         text: "Are you sure you are sure?",
         icon: "warning",
         buttons: true,
         dangerMode: true,
       }).then((confirmed) => {
         if (confirmed) {
           evt.detail.issueRequest();
         }
       });
     }
   });
   ```

With this configuration:

- Only buttons (or elements) with `confirm-with-sweet-alert='true'` use SweetAlert dialogs
- All others fall back to standard Htmx confirmations
- Users are shown a branded, modern confirmation modal before dangerous actions are performed

## Benefits and Flexibility

- **Event Interception**: Use the `htmx:confirm` event to tap into requests before their completion, customizing confirmation flows.
- **Enhanced UX**: SweetAlert offers improved visuals, customizable text, icons, and action buttons, resulting in more informed decisions by users.
- **Selective Application**: By using a specific attribute, you gain fine-grained control over which actions require richer confirmation dialogs.

## Conclusion

Htmx’s extensibility opens the door for premium user experiences. By combining its confirmation events with external libraries like SweetAlert, you elevate both safety and professionalism in your ASP.NET or web apps. Explore the [Htmx documentation](https://htmx.org/docs/) for more creative UX enhancements.
