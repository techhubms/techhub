# ASP.NET Core and Chunking HTTP Cookies

If you’ve spent time around web development or your grocery store’s baked goods aisle, you’ve probably dealt with **cookies**—this post discusses web cookies specifically.

A web cookie is a header key-value pair set on the server using the [`Set-Cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) header in the format `<name>=<value>`. Cookies persist on the client, and the client sends them to the server with every subsequent request. This mechanism enables state persistence in a fundamentally stateless web environment and helps avoid complex session management infrastructure.

However, cookies do have limitations, notably the [**4kb size limit**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#data_storage) for each unique cookie. This constraint can seriously impact ASP.NET Core applications, which often store encrypted and encoded user session data in cookies.

In this post, Khalid Abuhakmeh presents a sample solution using the same `ICookieManager` abstraction employed by ASP.NET Core to chunk large cookies, thereby overcoming these limitations.

## Why You Would and Wouldn’t Use Cookies

Cookies offer a straightforward method for maintaining state between HTTP requests as users interact with your application.

**Advantages:**

- Simplifies backend implementations, as relevant user state can be sent with each request.
- Useful for storing user information like IDs, names, and emails.
- The request/response cookie lifecycle is easy to debug since they appear in most HTTP logging mechanisms.

**Disadvantages:**

- Cookies are added to every request, including those that don’t need them (e.g., static file requests), causing unnecessary data transfer and resource use.
- Encrypted or chunked cookies require reassembling and decryption, adding to memory and CPU usage, depending on your request pipeline.
- A large number of big cookies can significantly increase request size (e.g., 10 cookies at maximum size lead to an extra 40KB per request).

**Conclusion:** Use cookies judiciously, being mindful of these trade-offs.

## Setting Cookies in ASP.NET Core

You can view the full sample at [Khalid's GitHub repository](https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/CookieMonster).

**Accessing cookies is straightforward:**

```csharp
ctx.Response.Cookies.Append("cookie_monster", "nom nom nom");
```

A sample demonstrating reading and updating a cookie value:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/nom-nom", async ctx => {
    ctx.Response.Cookies.Append(
        "cookie_monster",
        ctx.Request.Cookies.TryGetValue("cookie_monster", out var cookie)
            ? $"{cookie}, {RandomString()}"
            : $"{RandomString()}"
    );
    // more code
});
```

This works, but the cookie can keep growing until it hits the 4KB limit, which is problematic in real applications.

## Handling Large Cookies: Chunking with ChunkingCookieManager

To use cookie chunking, install the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies` NuGet package. This is often already included transitively but can be referenced explicitly for clarity.

**Register the ChunkingCookieManager in your services:**

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<ICookieManager>(svc => new ChunkingCookieManager {
    // characters, not bytes
    ChunkSize = 1000,
    ThrowForPartialCookies = true
});
```

- `ChunkSize` determines the size (in characters, not bytes) of each chunk. Defaults to 4050, but can be set lower to see the chunking effect sooner.
- `ThrowForPartialCookies` helps debug partial cookie issues.

**Sample implementation with minimal API endpoint:**

```csharp
app.MapGet("/chunks", async (HttpContext ctx, ICookieManager cookieManager) => {
    var value = cookieManager.GetRequestCookie(ctx, "chunky_monster") is { } cookie
        ? $"{cookie}, {RandomString()}"
        : $"{RandomString()}";

    cookieManager.AppendResponseCookie(ctx, "chunky_monster", value, new CookieOptions());
    // more code...
});
```

Key points for chunking:

- Only interact with cookies via the `ICookieManager` for logical grouping—to handle chunking automatically.
- The `ICookieManager` requires an `HttpContext` for its operations.
- `CookieOptions` can be used to set options like `Domain`, `Expires`, and `Secure` for each chunk.

**Browser DevTools display:**
| Name                | Value                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| chunky_monster      | chunks-2                          |
| chunky_monsterC1    | *value chunk up to `ChunkSize`*   |
| chunky_monsterC2    | *rest of value*                   |
| chunky_monsterCN    | *further chunks if necessary*     |

You have now successfully enabled cookie chunking in ASP.NET Core using built-in abstractions.

## Conclusion

Cookies remain foundational in web development, but developers must recognize their strengths and weaknesses. Exceeding cookie size limits should prompt a review of what’s stored and possible optimizations. Chunking offers a viable workaround but introduces complexity and potential performance costs. For custom scenarios, consider implementing your own `ICookieManager` for tailored behavior.
