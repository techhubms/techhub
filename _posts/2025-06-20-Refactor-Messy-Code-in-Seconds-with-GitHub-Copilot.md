# Refactor Messy Code in Seconds with GitHub Copilot

*Posted by Randy Pagels on Jul 11, 2025*

Do you struggle with messy, hard-to-read code? This tip explains how GitHub Copilot can help you refactor legacy or spaghetti code into clean, maintainable solutions—fast.

## Let GitHub Copilot Clean Up Your Code

Instead of manually rewriting or optimizing complex logic, use GitHub Copilot to automatically suggest cleaner and more efficient alternatives.

### How to Use Copilot for Refactoring

1. **Highlight the code** you want to improve in your editor.
2. **Add a comment** above the code, such as:

   ```python
   # Refactor this function to be more readable and efficient
   ```

3. **Invoke Copilot Chat** by pressing `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac).
4. **Review Copilot's suggestion** and decide whether to apply the changes.

### Example

**Before (original function):**

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        if 'price' in item and 'quantity' in item:
            total += item['price'] * item['quantity']
    return total
```

**After Copilot Refactor:**

```python
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items if 'price' in item and 'quantity' in item)
```

Result: the new version is more readable, more Pythonic, and easier to maintain.

## Quick Takeaway

Whenever you hit a wall with messy code, use GitHub Copilot's chat function and a well-phrased comment to generate improved versions instantly. This technique can help you:

- Save time on manual refactoring
- Improve code quality and readability
- Learn idiomatic patterns for your programming language

Give it a try next time you find yourself stuck with convoluted logic.
