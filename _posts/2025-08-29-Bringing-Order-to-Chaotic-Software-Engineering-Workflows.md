# Bringing Order to Chaotic Software Engineering Workflows

**Author:** Mike Vizard  
**Insight Contributor:** Shannon Mason, Chief Strategy Officer, Tempo

## Overview

Software development has always been complex, but modern demands have amplified workflow chaos. In this article, Shannon Mason from Tempo discusses why software engineering workflows remain turbulent and provides grounded guidance for development teams.

## Key Pain Points in Software Engineering

- Teams face pressure for continual innovation while maintaining security and efficiency.
- AI is often viewed as a cure-all, but research (including Cornell and MIT studies) reveals mixed outcomes:
  - AI tools can help junior engineers or greenfield projects.
  - In mature or complex codebases, AI can slow senior engineers due to extra review, debugging, and oversight.
- The increasing prevalence of low-code and no-code tools, and the rise of 'citizen developers,' add volume and variability to delivery pipelines, elevating concerns about scale, security, and quality.

## Practical Remedies for the Modern Team

Shannon Mason suggests several organizational tactics to reduce chaos:

- **Make Work Visible:** Increase transparency across teams to identify bottlenecks early.
- **Avoid Overloading:** Set realistic team capacity targets (e.g., planning for 80% capacity).
- **Promote Focus:** Implement strategies such as no-meeting days to minimize context-switching and burnout.
- **Balance Demands:** Recognize that the pace of change requires intentional workflow design, not just productivity hype.

## Perspective on AI Tools

- AI is likened to "the worldâ€™s smartest intern": helpful but in need of guidance.
- Unsupervised, AI-generated code can introduce errors and security exposures.
- AI increases responsibility for oversight rather than reducing it in complex projects.

## The Human Element

- Developers' well-being is at risk due to relentless context-switching and unrealistic expectations.
- Cultural shifts and smarter planning are essential to building sustainable, high-performing teams.

## Takeaway

AI will not eliminate chaos overnight, but teams can regain a sense of control by making work visible, setting boundaries, and fostering a culture that values focus and realistic planning.
