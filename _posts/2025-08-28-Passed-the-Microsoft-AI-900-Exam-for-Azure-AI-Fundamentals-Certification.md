# Passed the Microsoft AI-900 Exam for Azure AI Fundamentals Certification

**Author: Thomas Maurer**

I’m excited to share that I recently passed the **AI-900 exam** and earned the **Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamentals** certification!

## What is the AI-900 Certification?

The Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Fundamentals certification proves foundational understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) concepts and their practical application in Microsoft's Azure ecosystem. The AI-900 exam targets both technical and non-technical professionals seeking to:

- Grasp core AI workloads and responsible AI principles
- Learn basic machine learning concepts, including types, training, and evaluation
- Understand computer vision capabilities like image classification and facial recognition
- Explore natural language processing (NLP), including text analytics, translation, and sentiment analysis
- Get familiar with conversational AI, such as building chatbots and virtual agents

## Key Topics Covered

- **AI Workloads & Considerations:** Overview of responsible AI and use case identification
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals:** Types of ML, how models are trained, and model evaluation basics
- **Computer Vision:** Principles of image-related AI tasks—classification, detection, recognition
- **Natural Language Processing:** Solutions for analyzing and understanding language, including translation
- **Conversational AI:** Basics of building chatbots and integrating virtual agents

## My Perspective

For me, this journey was about more than just exam success—it was about deepening my practical understanding of how AI solutions can be developed and deployed using Azure’s services. Technologies like **Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure OpenAI Service** make it easier for professionals to build intelligent applications.

## Who Should Consider the AI-900?

This certification is a great entry point for anyone interested in:

- Gaining an understanding of core AI concepts using Microsoft Azure
- Exploring how AI can drive innovation and improve customer experience
- Preparing for more advanced certifications or hands-on Azure AI projects
