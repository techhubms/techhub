# Grafana Labs Extends AI Capabilities of Observability Platform

**Author: Mike Vizard**

Grafana Labs unveiled several enhancements to its observability platform at ObservabilityCON 2025, including powerful AI features for IT operations. Central to the update is the general availability of the **Grafana Assistant**, an artificial intelligence agent that facilitates:

- Natural language query generation in PromQL, LogQL, and TraceQL
- Role-based access controls for dashboards
- AI-supported incident management and mitigation recommendations

## Key Announcements and Features

### Grafana Assistant and Investigations

- **Grafana Assistant**: Now available to general users, it enables IT teams to quickly analyze telemetry data and generate actionable insights using AI.
- **Grafana Assistant Investigations**: A preview tool providing automated analysis of the observability stack, suggesting hypotheses, and creating mitigation recommendations.
- **Root Cause Analysis Workbench (RCA Workbench)**: Consolidates data anomalies, dependencies, and incident timelines into a unified interface, accelerating the time to identify and resolve issues.

### Adaptive Traces and Profiles

- **Adaptive Traces and Adaptive Profiles**: Dynamic tools that intelligently capture and manage performance data from production workloads, providing cost-controlled storage and enhanced troubleshooting capabilities.

### Compliance and Cloud Integration

- **Grafana Federal Cloud**: Now FedRAMP High and DoD IL5 compliant, supporting regulated industries and government requirements.
- **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)**: Offers enterprises a managed Grafana instance on their cloud of choice for a flat-rate fee.

### Database and Service Observability

- Extension of database observability with new integrations.
- The **Entity Catalog** automates service discovery and dependency mapping, creating curated health dashboards in real time.

### Long-Term Vision

- Leveraging AI to convert proprietary monitoring data into OpenTelemetry-compatible formats, ensuring broader data coverage and future-proofing the platform.

## Impact on IT Operations

Grafana’s new capabilities are aimed at reducing barriers to advanced observability:

- Less reliance on expert-level query knowledge due to AI-powered interfaces
- Faster incident investigation using knowledge graphs and AI-driven insights
- Streamlined compliance and integration for diverse enterprise and government IT environments

Mike Vizard notes that while autonomous self-healing via AI is not fully here yet, the platform’s advancements significantly democratize observability and incident response for IT professionals at all levels.
