When working with external APIs that lack SDKs or OpenAPI specifications, developers often face the tedious task of manually creating typed interfaces. Jesse Swart demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can dramatically simplify this process by generating complete TypeScript code from raw API documentation.<!--excerpt_end-->

By simply copy-pasting the relevant parts of API documentation (endpoint information, parameters, example responses) into a Copilot chat session with clear instructions, you can get fully typed interface definitions and service classes without writing a single line of code yourself. This approach not only saves time but also reduces the chance of human error when transcribing complex API structures.
