# Context Engineering Recipes: The Reflection Pattern for GitHub Copilot

*Posted by Randy Pagels on Oct 31, 2025*

## Overview

This installment of the Context Engineering Recipes mini series highlights the Reflection Pattern, which focuses on asking GitHub Copilot to reflect on and explain its own reasoning. Instead of simply accepting its suggestions, you can prompt Copilot to lay out the logic and assumptions behind its code, helping you make informed decisions.

## Why Use the Reflection Pattern?

The Reflection Pattern encourages Copilot to provide transparent rationales for its code completions and suggestions. By prompting the AI to explain itself, you can surface hidden logic, spot potential issues, and distinguish between well-thought-out solutions and vague responses.

## Key Prompt Approaches

### 1️⃣ Self Explanation

Ask Copilot to step through its thought process:

```
Explain the reasoning behind this code suggestion, step by step.
```

*Great for unpacking complex logic and understanding generated code.*

### 2️⃣ Self Critique

Encourage Copilot to find and address issues in its own outputs:

```
Review your previous answer. Identify any logical or security issues and suggest improvements.
```

*Useful for code quality checks, audits, and design reviews.*

### 3️⃣ Reflection Before Rewrite

Prompt Copilot to examine its code before making edits:

```
Before refactoring, explain what parts of this function are redundant or risky to change.
```

*Ensures safer refactoring with better context.*

### 4️⃣ Teach Back Mode

Have Copilot explain code as if mentoring a new developer:

```
Explain this function to a junior developer and include why each step is needed.
```

*Valuable for documentation, onboarding, and education.*

## Tips

- Reflection prompts help clarify Copilot's outputs, avoiding confusion or “spooky vague” answers.
- Using reflection can expose assumptions, prevent overlooked issues, and create more transparent AI-human collaboration.

## Takeaway

The Reflection Pattern transforms GitHub Copilot into a more insightful coding assistant, making its logic clear before you accept its help. Try these reflective prompt techniques to enhance your code reviews, learning, and development workflows.
