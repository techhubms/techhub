Dellenny demonstrates how sysadmins can use GitHub Copilot Chat to generate and refine PowerShell scripts from natural language prompts, enhancing automation in Microsoft 365 and Azure tasks.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Automating PowerShell Scripts with GitHub Copilot Chat for SysAdmins

For years, IT administrators relied on PowerShell to automate tasks such as user provisioning and tenant maintenance. Writing these scripts, especially for complex workflows or integrations with Microsoft 365 and Azure AD, often required a lot of effort and manual debugging.

## How GitHub Copilot Chat Changes Automation

GitHub Copilot Chat enables sysadmins to describe their automation needs in plain English and get ready-to-run PowerShell scripts in response. You can:

- Prompt Copilot to generate scripts from natural language (e.g., bulk-create users, assign licenses, add group memberships)
- Iterate with Copilot to refine scripts, add logging, improve error handling, or ensure compatibility with PowerShell 7
- Ask Copilot to explain commands or script sections (e.g., what Connect-MgGraph does)

## Typical Use Cases for SysAdmins

### 1. User Management

Automate repetitive tasks such as:

- Bulk account creation, disabling, or offboarding
- Password/MFA resets
- User synchronization between systems

**Example Prompt:**
> "Generate a PowerShell script to find all disabled users in Active Directory who haven’t logged in for 90 days and export their info to a CSV."

### 2. Tenant Maintenance

Simplify recurring checks and reports:

- License usage audits
- Security compliance scans
- Backup verifications

**Example Prompt:**
> "Write a script to check all SharePoint sites for external sharing links and email a summary report."

### 3. Environment Setup & Configuration

Accelerate onboarding for new environments:

- Install modules
- Configure policies
- Deploy baseline settings

**Example Prompt:**
> "Create a PowerShell script that installs RSAT tools, enables WinRM, and sets the execution policy to RemoteSigned."

## Iterative Script Refinement

The conversational nature of Copilot Chat means you can:

- Add try/catch blocks for better error handling
- Make scripts interactive
- Convert script logic into reusable functions

Sysadmins benefit from being able to break down complex workflows into smaller modules, receiving explanations for individual commands, and improving code quality through real-time collaboration with Copilot.

## Best Practices When Using Copilot

- Be specific in prompts—list systems, modules, and required parameters
- Always review generated code before running it, especially in production environments
- Keep tasks modular and manageable
- Ask Copilot for command explanations to deepen PowerShell expertise

## The Impact on SysAdmin Productivity

Copilot Chat empowers IT pros to focus on higher-value activities such as strategy, architecture design, and proactive maintenance, rather than spending excessive time on scripting mechanics. Automating PowerShell with Copilot means faster implementation for tasks across hybrid AD environments, tenant cleanups, and compliance enforcement.

**Key Takeaway:** GitHub Copilot Chat supports, not replaces, sysadmins—amplifying powershell skills by serving as an ever-ready scripting partner for Microsoft-focused environments.
