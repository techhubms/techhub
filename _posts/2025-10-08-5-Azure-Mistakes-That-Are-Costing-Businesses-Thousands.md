# 5 Azure Mistakes That Are Costing Businesses Thousands

Microsoft Azure offers scalability and powerful services, but complexity can lead to hidden costs. This guide explains the five most common Azure mistakes driving up cloud bills and provides practical steps for technical teams to address and avoid them.

## 1. Overprovisioning Resources

Oversized or idle resources, like large VMs or always-on test environments, can greatly increase costs.

- Use **Azure Advisor** to find underutilized assets
- Right-size VMs based on actual workload
- Implement **auto-scaling**
- Schedule automated shutdowns for development/test systems using **Azure Automation**

## 2. Ignoring Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

Running workloads around the clock on pay-as-you-go rates is expensive compared to Azure's commitment-based discounts.

- Analyze usage patterns and identify 24/7 workloads
- Choose **Reserved Instances (RIs)** or **Savings Plans** for predictable usage to save up to 72%
- Use **Azure Cost Management + Billing** to forecast savings before committing

## 3. Poor Tagging and Cost Governance

Lacking a standardized tagging policy leads to “zombie” resources and unclear spending accountability.

- Enforce consistent tags like `Department`, `Environment`, `Owner`, and `Project`
- Use **Azure Policy** to mandate tagging
- Leverage **Cost Allocation Reports** to track spend by business unit

## 4. Neglecting Data Egress and Storage Costs

Data transfer out of Azure and premium storage tiers can significantly affect your bill.

- Review patterns to reduce cross-region data transfers
- Store infrequently accessed data in **Cool** or **Archive** storage
- Use **Azure CDN** for efficient content delivery
- Regularly audit **Storage Accounts** for unused or duplicate blobs

## 5. Lack of Continuous Monitoring and Cost Alerts

Without regular monitoring, small leaks grow undetected until they significantly impact your budget.

- Set up **Azure Budgets** and automated cost alerts
- Schedule regular reviews in **Azure Cost Analysis**
- Adopt **FinOps** practices for continuous optimization

---

Effective Azure cost management requires continuous visibility, governance, and optimization. Addressing these mistakes can help organizations reduce spend by 20–40% without sacrificing performance or innovation.
