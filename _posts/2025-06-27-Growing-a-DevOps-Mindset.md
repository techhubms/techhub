# Growing a DevOps Mindset

*By Rene van Osnabrugge*

In 2024, I launched the [LEAD podcast](https://lead-podcast.io) with my good friend [Geert van der Cruijsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geertvandercruijsen). Our focus was on exploring the many facets of building an **engineering culture**. Across numerous episodes—some with guests, some without—we uncovered a wealth of stories and insights about changing the way teams work. I'm excited to share some of those stories here, blending them with my own reflections from the podcast. Credit is due not only to me, but also to Geert, our guests, and [Xebia](https://xebia.com), whose support made this possible.

## Technology is the Easy Part—Mindset is the Challenge

When organizations talk about transformation, technology often takes center stage. Technically, most changes are achievable; engineers can learn new tools, modify code, and get systems running. The true challenge emerges when change demands new ways of working and collaboration—often stepping outside one's comfort zone and team boundaries.

In one episode with Geert, we delved into the **mindset** needed to make meaningful change—the mindset that underpins DevOps. Embracing DevOps isn’t just about knowing the latest automation tools. It's about adopting a mentality that thrives not just on doing, but on collaborating, learning, and adapting.

## The Firewall Guy: Siloes and Mindset Roadblocks

A telling example came from cloud migration projects. While development teams may drive for agility and automation, entrenched silos become visible when legacy practices persist elsewhere. For instance, opening a firewall port might still require a two-week process—even in the cloud era. This isn't mere bureaucracy; it’s a reflection of fixed mindsets and a deep-seated reluctance to change roles or relinquish control. Sometimes, it's a fear of becoming irrelevant: if I'm not the firewall gatekeeper, what remains of my role?

These human fears—of losing control, falling behind, or exposing ignorance—can be the invisible hurdles to transformation.

## Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

This challenge connects closely to [Carol Dweck's *growth mindset* framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ&ab_channel=StanfordAlumni). Dweck identifies two core perspectives:

- **Fixed Mindset:** Abilities are static; success defines self-worth; failure is a threat, so people avoid risks and challenges.
- **Growth Mindset:** Abilities are malleable; success is a journey; failure is a learning opportunity, so individuals embrace challenges and feedback.

Many organizational pathologies—clinging to the status quo, avoiding challenges, offering surface-level agreement while withholding real commitment—trace back to a fear of being seen as wrong or less capable.

## Three Fears That Block Change

In addition, Patrick Lencioni’s book, [*Getting Naked*](https://www.tablegroup.com/product/getting-naked/?srsltid=AfmBOormAY9UEZTLagGQktf0wMzB3e6dyWbrDbGwGvC-kyog6_7bcXBz), identifies three fundamental workplace fears:

1. **Fear of being embarrassed**—Avoiding asking questions or challenging decisions.
2. **Fear of losing your job or business**—Withholding honest opinions, sugarcoating the truth.
3. **Fear of being inferior**—Steering clear of situations that may expose gaps in competence.

A culture dominated by these fears cannot build a true DevOps mindset. Leaders must create environments where learning, mistakes, and even “dumb” questions are accepted and valued as growth opportunities.

## Changing Mindsets: The ADKAR Model

To guide change across an organization, the [ADKAR model](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar) is a helpful tool:

- **Awareness**—Understanding why change is needed.
- **Desire**—Recognizing what's in it for the individual.
- **Knowledge**—Knowing what to do and how.
- **Ability**—Having space to practice new behaviors safely.
- **Reinforcement**—Sustaining and rewarding the new approach.

Many efforts jump directly to knowledge, providing tools and training, but overlook building desire and awareness. Without these, learning doesn’t stick, and transformation falters.

## Culture Shift: Trust Before Conflict

Adopting a DevOps mindset goes beyond individuals—it's about **team** and **organizational** culture. As Geert noted, trust is the precursor to healthy disagreement; open conflict, when built on trust, leads to genuine commitment. Without trust, teams simply nod along, but disengage afterward. Often, silent majorities drift along with the status quo, while vocal minorities dominate discussion.

The key is to focus on these quiet influencers and support them. Peer-driven change tends to be more lasting and meaningful than top-down mandates.

## Effort Over Outcome

A recurring theme in our conversations was the value of rewarding **effort** over simply celebrating outcomes. Whether in school, parenting, or the workplace, an exclusive focus on results discourages risk-taking and experimentation. Valuing effort, curiosity, teamwork, and thoughtful reflection instead lays a stronger foundation for sustainable growth.

That is, at its core, the true DevOps mindset—a commitment to continuous learning, experimentation, and collective improvement.
