# Aembit Launches IAM Solution for Agentic AI in Enterprise Environments

**Source: cybernewswire**  
**Date: October 30, 2025**

Aembit has unveiled a new identity and access management (IAM) platform designed specifically for agentic AI workloads in enterprise and hybrid environments. This expanded IAM offering targets the rapidly growing challenge of securing autonomous and user-driven AI agents operating across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS systems.

## Key Capabilities

- **Blended Identity:** Each AI agent receives a cryptographically verified identity, which can be bound to a human user when acting on their behalf. This ensures a single, traceable identity for every agent's action, supporting strong attribution and auditability.

- **MCP Identity Gateway:** A policy gateway that authenticates agent credentials and strictly enforces access permissions based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This system issues ephemeral credentials at runtime, so permissions and secrets are never exposed directly to the agent execution environment.

- **Real-Time, Centralized Control:** Integrates AI agent control into the existing Aembit Workload IAM foundation, unifying policy enforcement and monitoring with other enterprise workloads.

- **Audit and Compliance:** All agent activities are logged as structured events, providing companies an audit trail for compliance and investigation needs. Immediate permission revocation is supported for dynamic response to changing risk or security events.

## Addressing New Security Challenges

The move to agentic AI – where autonomous software acts independently of human oversight – pushes organizations to rethink traditional access models, many of which were designed for human users and rely on static credentials. Aembit's solution eliminates static secrets and shared credentials, favoring dynamic, cryptographically issued identities and just-in-time permissions. The platform enables:

- **Separation of Agent and Human Activity:** Distinct identity for AI agents ensures effective monitoring and accountability.
- **Least-Privilege and Zero Trust:** Permissions are granted on a strict, per-action basis, minimizing risk from broad or long-lived credentials.
- **Hybrid IT Compatibility:** Agents and enforcement mechanisms operate across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS environments.

## Enterprise Collaboration and Use Cases

Aembit reports that its IAM for Agentic AI was shaped through collaboration with enterprises, government agencies, and AI startups deploying AI agents for both operational and security workloads. Typical workloads include agents retrieving sensitive data, automating ticket handling, or executing code in distributed systems.
