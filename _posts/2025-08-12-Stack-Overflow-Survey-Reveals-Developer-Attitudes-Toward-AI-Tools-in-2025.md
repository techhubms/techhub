# Stack Overflow Survey Reveals Developer Attitudes Toward AI Tools in 2025

**Author:** Alan Shimel

## Overview

The 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey uncovers significant shifts in how developers approach artificial intelligence (AI) tools. With 84% of respondents already using or planning to use AI in their workflows, the survey illustrates a broad acceptance of AI-driven assistance — but also reveals an undercurrent of skepticism and caution, particularly around newer types of AI applications.

## Key Findings

- **Mainstream Adoption with Caution**: While generative AI tools like OpenAI's GPT models, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot see daily use by over half of professional developers, only 29% trust AI outputs fully, marking a downturn in confidence compared to previous years.
- **Generative vs. Agentic AI**: 82% of respondents use OpenAI’s GPT models, followed by Claude Sonnet (~44%) and Gemini Flash (~35%). Developers feel confident using generative AI for tasks such as code completion and bug troubleshooting. Conversely, only 31% use agentic AI (AI that takes autonomous, multi-step actions), with many expressing hesitancy to delegate complex tasks to such agents.
- **Eroding Trust in AI Outputs**: Favorable sentiment toward AI tools dropped to around 60% in 2025, down from over 70%. Nearly half (46%) of developers distrust AI accuracy, and 66% spend extra time debugging code produced by AI assistants.
- **Peer Verification Remains Essential**: Despite advances in AI, 75% of developers prefer consulting another person when AI guidance is questionable. "AI outputs are almost right — but not quite," resonates with 45% of respondents.
- **Tool Preferences and Trends**: OpenAI's GPT leads in use, but Claude Sonnet is admired by over 61% of developers. Overall, while ChatGPT dominates in usage, alternatives are gaining traction and attention.
- **The Road Ahead**: The community is embracing generative AI, but many hold back on adopting more autonomous, agentic AI until issues of maturity, reliability, and real-world efficacy are resolved.

## Insights and Implications

Developers utilize AI tools pragmatically: leveraging generative AI for productivity gains, yet validating results and retaining human oversight. The survey signals a maturing market where trust must be earned, not assumed. As technologies like GitHub Copilot become staples, the next phase will require AI to demonstrate reliability and transparency before wider, more autonomous adoption.

**Summary:**
Developers are adopting AI tools at a rapid pace but remain aware of their limitations, particularly regarding accuracy and the readiness of agentic AI. The 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, highlighted by Alan Shimel, gives a window into this evolving, pragmatic relationship between developers and AI technologies like OpenAI GPT and GitHub Copilot.
