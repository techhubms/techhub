# How to Cut Your Azure Bill in Half Without Losing Performance

Cloud services like Microsoft Azure provide exceptional scalability and flexibility for running workloads, but managing costs is a real challenge. With careful optimization, you can reduce your Azure spending by up to 50%—and still maintain performance.

## 1. Right-Size Your Virtual Machines (VMs)

- Review current VM usage with **Azure Advisor** for suggestions on underutilized resources.
- Use metrics in **Azure Monitor** (CPU and memory) to identify consistently underused VMs (typically below 40% utilization).
- Downsize VMs to a suitable SKU, or switch to burstable VMs (B-series) for variable workloads.

**Tip:** Switching from D-series to B-series VMs can save 30–60% if your workload fits.

## 2. Leverage Reserved Instances and Savings Plans

- **Reserved Instances (RI):** Commit to 1- or 3-year terms and save up to 72% compared to pay-as-you-go.
- **Savings Plans:** Offer flexibility across VM sizes and regions, with up to 65% savings.
- Use **Reservation Recommendations** in Azure Cost Management to identify ideal RI opportunities.

## 3. Turn Off Idle Resources

- Schedule shutdowns for development/test environments with **Azure Automation** or **Logic Apps**.
- Implement **auto-scaling** to reduce VM counts during low-traffic periods.
- Identify and remove unused disks or orphaned public IPs.

**Tip:** Limiting dev/test environments to 8 hours per day (instead of 24) can cut related costs by 66%.

## 4. Optimize Storage Costs

- Migrate infrequently used data to **Cool** or **Archive** tiers in Azure Blob Storage.
- Apply **lifecycle management policies** to automate data movement to lower-cost tiers.
- Enable data compression where applicable.

**Tip:** Archive tier storage is up to 80% less expensive than hot storage.

## 5. Use Azure Hybrid Benefit

- If you have on-premises **Windows Server** or **SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance**, apply them to Azure for savings up to 40% on VM costs.

**Tip:** Hybrid Benefit is especially useful during cloud migrations.

## 6. Monitor and Automate Cost Controls

- Set **budgets and alerts** in Azure Cost Management to stay within planned spend.
- Regularly check **Azure Advisor** for ongoing cost-saving ideas.
- Tag resources to track spending by project, department, or environment automatically.

**Tip:** Set aside time once a month for a cost review—optimizing cloud spend is an ongoing, iterative effort.

By following these strategies—right-sizing VMs, enabling reservation or savings plans, automating idle resource shutdown, optimizing storage, using licensing benefits, and implementing continuous monitoring—you can significantly reduce Azure costs while maintaining performance. Consistent review and incremental improvements make long-term savings possible.
