# How Much Context Should You Give?

*By Randy Pagels*

Knowing how much code to share with GitHub Copilot can dramatically impact the quality of its suggestions. Too little context might leave Copilot confused, while too much can produce vague answers. Here’s how to match your input to the Copilot feature and the task at hand.

## 1️⃣ Inline Chat: Keep It Close and Focused

- Select the specific function or code block you need help with.
- Example: `# Explain what this function does`
- **Best for:** Understanding a small section of code or fixing a localized bug.

## 2️⃣ Copilot Chat in the Sidebar: Provide Multiple Functions

- Share a couple of relevant functions instead of the whole file.
- Example: `# Suggest improvements for these functions to reduce duplication`
- **Best for:** Small refactoring, naming suggestions, or quick code reviews.

## 3️⃣ Copilot Edits: Focus on the File

- Select a section or the entire file for Copilot to rewrite, add comments, or restructure.
- Example: `# Refactor this file to use async/await consistently`
- **Best for:** Achieving file-level consistency and style improvements.

## 4️⃣ Copilot Agent Mode: Full Project Context

- For bigger tasks like updating import statements across multiple files, provide Copilot with wide context.
- Example: `# Update all imports to use absolute paths instead of relative ones`
- **Best for:** Multi-file changes, project-wide consistency, and dependency updates.

## Quick Warning

More context isn't always better—too much can make Copilot’s answers less specific. Start with a focused section and only expand the scope if you’re not getting useful results. Adjust the context as needed to get the best out of Copilot.

Find the balance that works for your task, and you’ll get the most value from GitHub Copilot.
