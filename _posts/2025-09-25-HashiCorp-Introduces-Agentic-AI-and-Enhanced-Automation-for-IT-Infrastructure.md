# HashiCorp Introduces Agentic AI and Enhanced Automation for IT Infrastructure

**Author: Mike Vizard**

## Overview

HashiCorp has unveiled several significant upgrades to its platform at HashiConf 2025, aiming to streamline the management and security of IT infrastructure. Announcements centered on agentic AI integration, broader automation support, and enhanced secrets and credential management, all designed to strengthen infrastructure as code (IaC) practices—and included preview features with direct applicability for DevOps teams using tools from Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and others.

## Key Highlights

- **AI Agent Integration**: HashiCorp is previewing new AI agents that will help provision infrastructure as code (IaC), intending to make infrastructure and security automation more accessible for IT personnel regardless of coding skill.

- **Multi-Framework Automation**: The platform now supports integration with third-party automation frameworks, specifically referencing support for Microsoft and AWS automation frameworks as well as Red Hat Ansible. This streamlines workflows both pre- and post-deployment.

- **Project Infragraph**: A foundation for future expansion of AI-driven infrastructure management, setting the stage for further cross-platform integrations.

- **Lifecycle and Security Enhancements**:
    - **HCP Terraform Stacks**: Generally available, this enables deployment and management of interdependent Terraform configurations as cohesive units.
    - **HCP Terraform Search and Actions**: New beta features expedite infrastructure discovery, resource import, and Day 2 operations automation.
    - **SBOM Management with HCP Packer**: Provides increased visibility and secure storage for software builds of material.
    - **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**: Beta feature that eases AI agent accessibility to HCP.
    - **HCP Boundary RDP Credential Injection (Beta)**: Secures Windows Remote Desktop sessions.
    - **HCP Vault Radar MCP Server (Beta)**: Allows AI tools to analyze for leaks and misconfigurations.
    - **HCP Vault Dedicated**: Aids in secrets inventory reporting.
    - **Vault Enterprise 1.21**: Automates cryptographic workflows, enforces post-quantum readiness, and supports zero trust principles via new APIs.
    - **HCP Vault Radar Jira SaaS Scanning**: Generally available for SaaS-focused vulnerability scanning.
    - **IDEs Plugins (Beta)**: Plugin ecosystem aimed at integrated development environments for better secrets/security management.

- **Security and Zero Trust Focus**: Many of the new features target improved secrets management, credential security, and automation of zero-trust controls—crucial for organizations with distributed, hybrid, or multi-cloud architectures.

## Microsoft Integration Details

The update specifically notes expanded support for Microsoft automation frameworks. DevOps teams using Microsoft systems can connect HashiCorp automation and security tools directly into their environments, improving pipeline management, compliance, and infrastructure provisioning.

## Practical Impact for DevOps and Security Teams

- Simplifies multi-platform workflows including Azure/Microsoft, AWS, and IBM systems.
- Facilitates secure, automated credential and secrets management for cloud and hybrid deployments.
- Reduces manual intervention and makes infrastructure and compliance tasks more scalable.
- Lays foundation for future AI-driven operations.
