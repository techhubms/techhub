Dellenny presents a practical guide to adopting immutable infrastructure on Azure, detailing the steps, best practices, and tooling for reliable cloud deployments with DevOps workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Building Resilient Systems with Immutable Infrastructure on Azure

In modern DevOps and cloud-native architecture, **immutable infrastructure** is a cornerstone for building reliable, consistent, and secure systems. In this post, Dellenny explores what immutable infrastructure means, its advantages, and how to implement it effectively on Azure with industry-standard tools and workflows.

## What is Immutable Infrastructure?

Immutable infrastructure is a paradigm in which servers, VMs, or containers are *never* updated after deployment. Instead, when a change is needed—such as a new application version or configuration tweak—a new instance is built and deployed. Old versions are destroyed, ensuring all running infrastructure matches the latest specifications.

**Mutable Infrastructure:**

- Allows SSH/RDP access for manual updates
- Prone to configuration drift
- State is harder to reproduce

**Immutable Infrastructure:**

- No in-place modifications
- Each deployment creates new VMs or containers
- Consistency and traceability are built in

## Benefits of Immutable Infrastructure

- **Consistency:** Deployments are built from controlled, versioned images/templates
- **Reliability:** What's running in production is always known and reproducible
- **Auditability:** Deployments are traceable for auditing and compliance
- **Easy Rollbacks:** Restoring a previous version is as simple as redeploying an older image or template
- **Security:** Limiting access (e.g. no SSH/RDP) reduces the attack surface

## Implementing Immutable Infrastructure in Azure

### 1. Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Use tools like **ARM templates**, **Bicep**, or **Terraform** to define your infrastructure in a version-controlled way. For example:

```bicep
resource myVm 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2021-07-01' = {
  name: 'app-vm-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
  location: resourceGroup().location
  properties: {
    hardwareProfile: {
      vmSize: 'Standard_B2s'
    }
    storageProfile: {
      imageReference: {
        publisher: 'Canonical'
        offer: 'UbuntuServer'
        sku: '18.04-LTS'
        version: 'latest'
      }
      osDisk: {
        createOption: 'FromImage'
      }
    }
    osProfile: {
      computerName: 'appvm'
      adminUsername: 'azureuser'
      adminPassword: 'SecurePassword123'
    }
    networkProfile: {
      networkInterfaces: [
        {
          id: nic.id
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Use Image-Based Deployment

Utilize **Azure Image Builder**, **Packer**, or the **Azure Compute Gallery** to bake application images ahead of time. Reference these images in your IaC files for reliable, repeatable deployments.

```json
"imageReference": {
  "id": "/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{gallery}/images/{image}/versions/{version}"
}
```

### 3. Deploy with Blue-Green or Rolling Strategies

Use **Azure VM Scale Sets** or **App Service Deployment Slots** for safe rollouts:

- **Blue-Green:** Deploy a parallel environment, redirect traffic, then retire the old environment
- **Rolling Upgrade:** Gradually replace old instances with new ones in controlled batches

Example configuration for rolling upgrades:

```json
"upgradePolicy": {
  "mode": "Rolling",
  "rollingUpgradePolicy": {
    "maxBatchInstancePercent": 20,
    "maxUnhealthyInstancePercent": 20,
    "pauseTimeBetweenBatches": "PT0S"
  }
}
```

### 4. Automate Everything with CI/CD

Automate your entire workflow using **Azure DevOps Pipelines**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Terraform Cloud**. A typical pipeline:

- Code Change → Build Image (e.g. Packer) → Push to Azure Compute Gallery
- Deploy via ARM/Bicep/Terraform → Replace Instances → Validate health

## Example Workflow: Web App Deployment

1. **Build App Image:** Use Packer and Azure DevOps
2. **Push to Compute Gallery:** Upload versioned VM images
3. **Update IaC templates:** Reference new image
4. **Redeploy VM Scale Set:** New instances come up, old are drained/removed
5. **Monitor Health:** Use Azure Monitor / Application Insights

## Resource Clean-Up Best Practices

To avoid unnecessary costs and clutter:

- Automate resource deletion with Azure CLI or Automation
- Set up lifecycle management policies in Azure

## Azure Services for Immutable Infrastructure

- **Azure DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines
- **Azure Compute Gallery**: Centralized image library
- **VM Scale Sets**: Automated, scalable compute pools
- **Packer**: Image creation
- **Terraform / Bicep / ARM**: Infrastructure as code
- **Deployment Slots**: For zero-downtime app releases

## Conclusion

Adopting the immutable infrastructure pattern on Azure boosts consistency, auditability, and security for cloud deployments. With Microsoft’s tooling ecosystem, the approach is mature and fully supported for enterprise workloads.
