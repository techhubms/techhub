Mike Vizard discusses how Hush Security's new platform addresses application secrets management using runtime identity controls and SPIFFE integration, offering DevSecOps teams a modern way to reduce risks from secret sprawl.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Hush Security Unveils Platform to Eliminate Application Secrets

**Author:** Mike Vizard

## Overview

Hush Security has launched a platform designed to change how application secrets—such as API keys and credentials—are handled in modern cloud-native and AI-driven environments. Rather than relying on legacy secrets vaults, the platform uses runtime identity controls, just-in-time access, and policy-driven governance to secure workload access.

## Key Features

- **Secrets Discovery:** Continuously scans and maps all workloads, services, and AI agents from code to runtime, identifying the presence of sensitive secrets and access needs.
- **Runtime Access Controls:** Enforces access policies dynamically at runtime instead of retrieving secrets from vaults, reducing latency and the attack surface.
- **SPIFFE Integration:** Embeds the Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) from CNCF, abstracting away complex implementation details and providing seamless identity-based access management.
- **Credential-Free Security:** By eliminating stored credentials and secrets, the platform reduces one of the major entry points for malicious actors.
- **Secrets Sprawl Mitigation:** Enables organizations to migrate discovered secrets into the platform with one click, thereby centralizing governance and simplifying remediation.

## AI and Microservices Impact

As deployments of AI agents and microservices grow, the challenge of managing secrets at scale has intensified. Hush Security’s platform is particularly focused on scalable, low-latency authentication for these dynamic environments and enables least-privilege, policy-based access on demand.

## Zero Trust and DevSecOps Alignment

The approach aligns with zero trust principles—enforcing least-privilege dynamically and minimizing persistent credentials. DevSecOps teams benefit from automated secrets detection and simplified compliance management, with risks prioritized based on real runtime behavior and potential impact.

## Assessment and Adoption

Hush Security is offering a free assessment to help organizations detect exposed secrets in code and map their ownership, providing an on-ramp to migrate secrets into its managed platform, thus minimizing secret sprawl and improving security posture.

## Implications

The shift toward runtime identity controls may reduce dependency on traditional vaults and secrets management, unlocking lower-latency, credential-free access for modern applications while addressing a major vulnerability source—stolen or leaked secrets.
