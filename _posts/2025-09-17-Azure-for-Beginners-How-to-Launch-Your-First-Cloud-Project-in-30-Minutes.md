# Azure for Beginners: How to Launch Your First Cloud Project in 30 Minutes

Cloud computing can seem daunting at first, but Microsoft Azure makes it accessible for beginners. In this walkthrough, Dellenny demonstrates how to get started with Azure in just half an hour.

## What Is Azure and Why Choose It?

Microsoft Azure is a leading cloud platform providing hundreds of scalable services including virtual machines, databases, AI tools, and DevOps pipelines. For those new to cloud, Azure offers:

- **Free tier credits** for new accounts
- A user-friendly graphical portal
- Flexible scaling without hardware worries

## Step 1: Create a Free Azure Account (5 Minutes)

- Visit [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) and sign up using your Microsoft account.
- Provide verification details (a phone number and card; no charges unless you upgrade).
- You'll get **$200 in credits** for 30 days and 55+ free services.

## Step 2: Get Comfortable with the Azure Portal (5 Minutes)

- Log in to access the **Azure Portal** dashboard.
- Explore key abilities:
  - **Search bar** to find services easily
  - **Resource groups** for organizing cloud resources
  - The **Marketplace** for prebuilt services and templates

## Step 3: Launch a Virtual Machine (15 Minutes)

1. In the portal, search for **Virtual Machines** and select **Create**.
2. Choose **Azure Virtual Machine**.
3. Configure base settings:
    - **Subscription**: Free Trial
    - **Resource Group**: e.g., `my-first-project`
    - **VM Name**: e.g., `MyFirstVM`
    - **Region**: Closest location for speed
    - **Image**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS or Windows 11
    - **Size**: Free-tier (such as B1s)
4. Set up your login (username/password or SSH key).
5. Click **Create** â€” deployment is automatic.

## Step 4: Connect to Your VM (5 Minutes)

- For **Linux VMs**, connect using SSH (`ssh username@your-vm-ip`)
- For **Windows VMs**, download the Remote Desktop (RDP) file via the portal and login

Now you have your own cloud-hosted computer!

## What's Next?

Continue your Azure journey with:

- Hosting websites using Azure App Service
- Storing data in Azure Blob Storage
- Setting up SQL Databases
- Exploring AI with Azure Cognitive Services

By starting with a simple virtual machine, you're well on your way to leveraging all Azure offers, including app hosting, storage solutions, and advanced cloud tools.
