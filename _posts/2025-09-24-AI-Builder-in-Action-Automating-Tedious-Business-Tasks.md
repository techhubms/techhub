**Author: Dellenny**

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is increasingly reshaping business operations—not just in headline-grabbing innovations, but in the automation of routine, time-consuming tasks. Microsoft AI Builder extends these capabilities to business users through the Power Platform, enabling easy deployment of AI solutions without requiring deep development expertise.

- Predict business outcomes with models
- Detect objects in images

## Common Tedious Business Tasks Addressed by AI Builder

- **Invoice Processing:** Automating data entry from scanned documents
