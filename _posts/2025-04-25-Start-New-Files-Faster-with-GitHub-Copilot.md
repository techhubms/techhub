# Start New Files Faster with GitHub Copilot

*Written by Randy Pagels*

Starting a new file from scratch can be a common hurdle for developers, regardless of the technology stack involved. This article explains how to overcome 'blank file syndrome' by using GitHub Copilot to automatically generate foundational code—eliminating the need for manual boilerplate setup or repetitive reference hunting.

## Let Copilot Generate the Starting Template

With GitHub Copilot, developers can instantly build out the basic structure of files such as import statements, class declarations, and markup, using natural language prompts. This process helps save time and keeps developers focused on substantive work instead of rote setup.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a New File**
   - Examples: `index.html`, `app.py`, or `component.jsx`.
2. **Add a Natural Language Comment at the Top**
   - Example for Python: `# Create a Flask API with one GET route`
   - Example for React: `// Create a basic React component that displays a user profile`
3. **Activate Copilot**
   - Press `Tab` or invoke Copilot Chat (Ctrl + I) to review suggestions.
4. **Review and Edit as Needed**
   - Copilot supplies context-aware code, which you can refine to fit project requirements.

## Common File Types Supported

- **Python scripts**
- **HTML boilerplates**
- **React components**
- **CSS files**
- **YAML configuration files**
- **Dockerfiles**
- **GitHub Actions workflows**

GitHub Copilot significantly boosts productivity by handling the repetitive parts of file creation for these and other templates.

## Quick Takeaway

When facing a blank file, letting GitHub Copilot generate a smart starting point accelerates your workflow and lets you concentrate on writing great code—rather than setting up the basics.
