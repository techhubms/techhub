# Federated Identity in Azure: Seamless Access with External Identity Providers

Managing user identities and providing secure access has become essential, especially as organizations adopt hybrid and multi-cloud environments. In this article, Dellenny explores how the Federated Identity pattern is implemented on Microsoft Azure, offering guidance on integrating external identity providers (IdPs) using open standards and Azure technologies.

## What Is Federated Identity?

Federated Identity enables users to access applications using credentials from trusted external systems (IdPs), rather than maintaining separate usernames and passwords. Azure implements this using standards such as:

- **OAuth 2.0**
- **SAML 2.0**
- **OpenID Connect**

This approach centralizes identity management, decouples authentication from applications, improves security, and simplifies the user experience.

## How Federated Identity Works in Azure

The typical flow in Azure involves:

1. User attempts to access an Azure-hosted application.
2. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID) redirects the user to an external IdP (Google, Facebook, Okta, AD FS, etc.).
3. The IdP authenticates the user and sends a token back to Azure AD using OAuth or SAML.
4. Azure AD validates the token and grants access, optionally issuing its own token.

This flow supports Single Sign-On (SSO) experiences while leveraging protocols that are industry standards.

## Supported External Identity Providers in Azure

Azure AD can federate with:

- **Social IdPs**: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Microsoft
- **Enterprise IdPs**: AD FS, Okta, Ping Identity
- **Custom Providers**: Any supporting OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0

Configuration is typically done through Azure AD B2C or the Enterprise Applications portal.

## Protocols in Action

- **OAuth 2.0**: Used mainly for authorization; Azure AD can combine it with OpenID Connect for authentication.
- **SAML 2.0**: Standard for enterprise SSO; Azure AD can act as a SAML service provider.

## Benefits of Federated Identity in Azure

- **Centralized Identity Management**: Reduces password sprawl, leverages trusted IdPs.
- **Improved Security**: Uses tokens, supports Multifactor Authentication (MFA), and enables conditional access policies.
- **Seamless User Experience**: Enables SSO across a variety of apps and platforms.
- **Scalability and Extensibility**: Supports diverse consumer and enterprise scenarios.

## Example Use Case: Google Sign-In with Azure AD B2C

1. Set up a Google OAuth 2.0 client ID.
2. Register Google as an IdP in Azure AD B2C.
3. Create a user flow including Google login.
4. Integrate your app with Azure AD B2C.

Result: Users can log in using Google credentials without creating new passwords.

## Best Practices

- Prefer OpenID Connect where possible.
- Enable MFA for increased security.
- Monitor sign-ins and audit logs in Azure AD.
- Apply conditional access policies for federated users.

Federated Identity is crucial for secure, user-friendly authentication in modern cloud architectures. Leveraging Azureâ€™s integration capabilities and protocols like OAuth and SAML, organizations can provide seamless, secure access to users across domains, apps, and clouds.
