Mike Vizard details JFrog’s launch of a new DevOps platform designed for the agentic AI era, outlining how the JFry platform supports AI agent integration and workflow governance for modern development teams.<!--excerpt_end-->

# JFrog Unveils DevOps Platform for the Agentic AI Era

JFrog unveiled 'JFry,' a new DevOps platform at its annual SwampUP conference, aiming to help application developers integrate AI agents into their workflows at scale.

## Key Features and Integrations

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Developed by Anthropic, enabling JFry to interact with multiple AI repositories and platforms, including Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code.
- **Centralized Management:** DevOps teams can centrally manage the storage, sharing, and serving of software components using semantic metadata. This optimizes release deployments and integrates with both package managers and GitHub repositories.
- **AI-driven Automation:** JFrog developed specialized AI agents to automate security vulnerability remediation using analytics-based policies applied during code writing.
- **JFrog AppTrust & Evidence Ecosystem:** AppTrust provides a unified platform for governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) teams, further supported by an ecosystem of partners such as GitHub, ServiceNow, SonarQube, and others.
- **Secure Model Registry:** The catalog for AI models is enhanced with governance policies and cost tracking, supporting deployments of cloud or on-premises models (including NVIDIA Nemotron). Developers can search and explore models with detailed metadata and apply vulnerability analysis via JFrog Xray.

## Strategic Impact on DevOps

Eyal Dyment, JFrog’s VP of Products, emphasized that JFry aims to simplify governance across the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), covering code produced by both humans and AI agents.

The platform also addresses the growing need for unified security and GRC capabilities as AI scales in DevOps environments. Automation is expected to help teams keep pace with the rapid increase in simultaneous application deployments.

## The Evolving DevOps Landscape

- Increased use of specialized AI agents for automated coding, testing, and deployment tasks.
- The need to revisit DevOps tools and platforms to ensure future scalability.
- Unified approaches for security, governance, and risk management will be crucial as DevOps and AI become more closely intertwined.

## Images and Media

- The article includes multiple workflow diagrams and event banners from the SwampUP conference, depicting platform architecture and evidence ecosystems.
