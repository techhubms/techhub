# sleep-pc: A .NET Native AOT Tool to Make Windows Sleep After a Timeout

**Author:** Andrew Lock  
**GitHub:** [andrewlock/sleep-pc](https://github.com/andrewlock/sleep-pc)  
**NuGet:** [sleep-pc](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sleep-pc)

## Overview

This post describes the creation of `sleep-pc`, a small command-line tool for Windows, written in C# and built with the latest .NET (8/10) Native AOT features. The tool puts your Windows PC to sleep after a configurable timeout, using the Win32 `SetSuspendState` API. Andrew Lock walks through the design and the lessons learned packaging the tool for NuGet as a .NET CLI tool.

## Background: Why Automate Sleep?

Like many, Andrew found it difficult to make his Windows laptop reliably sleep after certain actions (such as finishing a playlist in Windows Media Player Legacy). Tired of power management struggles, he decided to automate the process: _a tiny tool that sleeps the laptop after a specified period._

## First Attempt: Simple Win32 Sleep Via P/Invoke

A proof-of-concept version simply waits, then calls the Win32 API:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

var wait = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60 * 60); // 1 hour
Console.WriteLine($"Waiting for {wait}");
Thread.Sleep(wait);
Console.WriteLine("Sleeping!");
SetSuspendState(false, false, false);

[DllImport("PowrProf.dll", SetLastError = true)]
static extern bool SetSuspendState(bool hibernate, bool forceCritical, bool disableWakeEvent);
```

This uses `SetSuspendState` from `PowrProf.dll` to trigger sleep. Tweaks around force/hibernate state were also explored.

## Improving The Tool: CLI Arguments & Native AOT

To make the tool user-friendly and robust:

- Added argument parsing & help text, leveraging [ConsoleAppFramework](https://github.com/Cysharp/ConsoleAppFramework) (fast, AOT-safe, zero-reflection CLI toolkit).
- Compiled using Native AOT features enabled by .NET 8/10.
- Published as a .NET global tool (installable via NuGet).

**Sample argument parsing:**

```csharp
await ConsoleApp.RunAsync(args, App.Countdown);

public static async Task Countdown(
  [Range(1, 99 * 60 * 60)] uint sleepDelaySeconds = 3600,
  bool dryRun = false,
  CancellationToken ct = default)
{
  // timer logic...
}
```

## Native AOT & Trimming

- Added `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` in the `.csproj` to publish a natively compiled, small executable (3.3MB).
- Used `.NET 10` tools features for packaging, including a compromise NuGet pack for maximum compatibility.
- Explored further trimming and analyzed binary size with [Sizoscope](https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/sizoscope).

**csproj NuGet packing highlights:**

```xml
<PackAsTool>true</PackAsTool>
<ToolCommandName>sleep-pc</ToolCommandName>
<PackageId>sleep-pc</PackageId>
<PackageVersion>0.1.0</PackageVersion>
<Authors>Andrew Lock</Authors>
```

## Console Output Polish

- Chose not to use Spectre.Console (not fully Native AOT compatible).
- Implemented an in-place countdown timer in the console for better user feedback via simple backspace tricks.

## Packaging and Installation

- Packaged for NuGet with dual support: framework-dependent (`net8.0`) and platform-specific Native AOT (`net10.0` win-x64).
- Users can install globally via: `dotnet tool install -g sleep-pc`.

## Summary

Andrew Lock provides a practical, well-documented guide for small utility development in modern .NET. The post covers:

- P/Invoke interop
- Command-line app design
- Native AOT compilation and trimming
- NuGet tool packaging with compatibility for .NET 8/10
- Lessons for minimizing binary size and maximizing performance
