# Microsoft Previews MCP Tool for SQL Server: Enhancing AI-Driven Database Interaction

Tim Anderson explores Microsoft's announcement of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool for SQL Server, designed to bridge databases and AI agents such as GitHub Copilot and Claude Code. This open-source tool, with implementations in Node.js and .NET, aims to allow users—including those without expert SQL knowledge—to interact with databases using natural language rather than hand-written SQL.

## Overview and Capabilities

Principal Product Manager Arun Vijayraghavan positioned the MCP preview as "the next leap in data interaction," suggesting that traditional SQL interfaces pose barriers for both experts and non-experts. Microsoft's tool, available on GitHub under SQL AI Samples, is open source and currently runs locally as an MCP server, implemented for both Node.js and .NET environments.

### Supported Commands

The MCP server exposes the following commands for SQL Server:

- List Tables
- Describe Table
- Create Table
- Drop Table
- Insert Data
- Read Data
- Update Data
- Create Index

Currently, the tool is geared for Azure SQL databases and supports Entra ID authentication. While SQL Server connections may be added in the future, now it is designed primarily for Azure scenarios.

## Integration with AI Agents

This protocol allows AI agents, such as GitHub Copilot and Claude Desktop, to perform database operations directly. The author notes that the tool should work with other AI agents that can understand the standard protocol; early experimentation with Google Gemini CLI was successful.

## Installation and First Impressions

Following the published guidance, setup involved running the MCP server and authenticating via Entra ID. While basic commands like listing tables worked, the review notes that some operations were slow or lacking feedback about progress or errors, making troubleshooting awkward for users.

### Feature Limitations

The MCP interface prohibits certain SQL commands, such as direct `ALTER TABLE` operations. For example, after creating a `Customer` table, the user could not add an additional field directly—Copilot simply rejected the statement. Gemini provided a more helpful workaround by suggesting a new table and migrating data, but overall, these steps were less efficient compared to manual SQL.

## Use Cases and Risks

While scenarios like non-expert users creating complete databases via natural language are compelling, the article flags concerns: AI-generated queries may not optimize performance, and lack of transparency could introduce subtle bugs. Expert developers might find value in automating or standardizing routine operations, but would also need to weigh productivity benefits against security and reliability risks.

## Conclusion

The MCP server for SQL Server offers a promising bridge between developer/AI tooling and data management. Its ability to allow AI-powered interaction through both Node.js and .NET makes it relevant for cloud and hybrid Microsoft scenarios. However, current limitations, performance bottlenecks, and incomplete command support mean it may not yet replace direct SQL or satisfy experienced developers seeking full control.
