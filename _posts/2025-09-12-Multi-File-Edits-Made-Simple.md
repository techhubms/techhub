Randy Pagels details how GitHub Copilot's multi-file edits empower developers to refactor and modernize codebases efficiently while maintaining full control over project changes.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Multi-File Edits Made Simple

*Posted on Sep 12, 2025*

## Overview

GitHub Copilot's latest feature—multi-file edits—streamlines the process of applying code changes that affect multiple files in your project. Whether you’re refactoring a function, updating import syntax, or standardizing code style, Copilot helps you make these updates efficiently with consistency and control.

## Key Use Cases

- **Refactor Across Files**: Easily rename functions or update usages throughout your entire project. For example, renaming `getUserData` to `fetchUserData` updates all relevant references at once.
- **Modernize Imports**: Transform outdated CommonJS `require` calls to modern ES module `import` statements across modules.
- **Standardize Style**: Apply coding patterns, like converting promise chains to `async/await`, throughout your codebase.
- **Update API routes and Adjust Tests**: Synchronously refactor API endpoints and ensure corresponding tests reflect the new structure.
- **Replace Deprecated Functions**: Swap out deprecated code with newer helpers or APIs wherever they appear.

## How It Works

With multi-file edits, Copilot:

- Scans your entire project to locate all relevant references or patterns to be updated.
- Proposes coordinated suggestions across files, visible in a diff view.
- Lets you review suggested changes similar to a pull request—accept, reject, or tweak each edit before applying.
- Streamlines wide-reaching refactoring while leaving you in control of what’s changed.

## Tips for Better Refactoring

- Use clear, descriptive prompts (e.g., "Change all CommonJS require statements to ES module imports").
- Preview every suggestion using the integrated diff to validate Copilot’s recommendations.
- Standardize complex patterns (like error handling or async/await usage) across multiple files for consistent best practices.

## Example Prompts

- `# Update all references to getUserData to use the new fetchUserData function`
- `# Apply async/await instead of promise chains in all service files`
- `# Standardize error handling across controllers`

## Quick Takeaway

Multi-file Copilot Edits allow you to handle broad, repetitive refactors in minutes instead of hours, freeing you to focus on higher-level problem solving while maintaining complete oversight of your codebase.
