# Copilot vs. Chat: Sidekick Showdown

*By Randy Pagels (randy.pagels@xebia.com), posted on Jul 11, 2025*

## Introduction

Choosing between GitHub Copilot’s inline code suggestions and conversational AI tools like Copilot Chat or ChatGPT depends on your workflow and the problem you’re trying to solve. This article explains when to leverage each tool and how combining them can improve your coding productivity and learning.

## Comparing the Tools

### GitHub Copilot (Inline)

- **How it works:** Provides immediate, in-context code suggestions as you type directly in your editor.
- **Strengths:** Ideal for quick code completion, stubbing out functions, generating boilerplate code, and fixing common bugs with minimal effort.
- **Usage:** Simply start typing and Copilot will proactively suggest code relevant to your context—no explicit queries required.

### Chatbots (Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others)

- **How they work:** Operate through a conversational interface where you describe your problem, paste code snippets, or ask for explanations.
- **Strengths:** Excels at providing detailed explanations, exploring architectural solutions, generating multiple code variations, writing documentation, or helping navigate unfamiliar APIs.
- **Usage:** Engage in dialogue for help with refactoring, understanding problems, planning tests, or inquiring about why certain code behaves in a particular way.

## When to Use Each

- **Use Copilot (Inline) for:**
  - Fast code completion
  - Generating stubs and boilerplate
  - Quickly fixing bugs
  - Repetitive/basic coding tasks
  
- **Use Chatbots for:**
  - Code explanations (e.g., “Explain this bug”)
  - Refactoring examples (e.g., “Refactor this method 3 ways”)
  - Writing complex test plans
  - Diagnosing errors or understanding code failures

## Pro Tip: Combine Both Tools

Don’t treat it as an either/or decision. Leveraging both tools in tandem brings speed and depth to your development process.

### Example Workflow

1. Use Copilot inline for rapid suggestions as you build.
2. Encounter a tough problem? Switch to Copilot Chat/ChatGPT for a dialogue about root causes, explanations, or brainstorming solutions.
3. Paste error messages or unclear code into the chatbot for review and advice.
4. Integrate useful chatbot outputs back into your editor to continue working and testing efficiently.

## Conclusion

**Bottom line:**

- *GitHub Copilot inline* acts as your quick code assistant for live coding efficiency.
- *Chatbots* provide a more interactive, versatile partner for complex questions and creative problem-solving.

By using both, you’ll benefit from faster development, greater learning opportunities, and the ability to tackle challenges from multiple angles.
