# Security Flaw in Cursor AI Coding Tool Risks Exploiting Developers

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Oasis Security has identified a security vulnerability in the Cursor AI code editor by Anysphere, Inc., which could allow a malicious code repository to auto-execute code when opened. This risk exists due to the Cursor tool's default disabling of the Workspace Trust feature, unlike the open source Visual Studio (VS) Code editor by Microsoft upon which Cursor is based.

## Details of the Security Flaw

- **Vulnerability:** Maliciously crafted code repositories may execute arbitrary code as soon as they are opened in Cursor, risking developer and organizational security.
- **Root Cause:** Cursor disables Workspace Trust by default, potentially allowing auto-execution of tasks specified in `.vscode/tasks.json` files (such as with `"runOn": "folderOpen"`).
- **Mitigation Recommendations from Oasis Security:**
  - Enable Workspace Trust at startup.
  - Set `task.allowAutomaticTasks` to `off` to prevent unwanted automatic task execution.
  - Only open unknown repositories in isolated, safe environments.
  - Search for `.vscode/tasks.json` files using `"runOn": "folderOpen"` and monitor for spawned shells or unexpected outbound network requests immediately after opening a project.

## Broader DevSecOps and AI Tooling Implications

- **Developer Practices:** DevSecOps teams should define and enforce policies for AI coding tool usage, rather than allowing shadow tools without oversight.
- **AI Coding Tool Risks:** These tools, reliant on LLMs, may generate verbose code and sometimes replicate flawed coding patterns present in their training data. Manual review of generated code remains essential.
- **Maintenance Concerns:** Automatically generated code can be harder to debug and maintain, underscoring the importance of best practices and clear security policies.

## Next Steps

- The Cursor development team plans to update security guidance, but ultimate responsibility lies with developers and their organizations to enforce strong cybersecurity policies around their coding environments.

## Key Takeaways

- Always review and adjust the default security features of AI-driven development tools.
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities and actively contribute to a secure development environment by participating in community discussions and following up-to-date DevSecOps recommendations.
