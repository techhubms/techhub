# Find and Fix Typos Faster with GitHub Copilot

Typos can be sneaky—a missing letter in a variable name, an incorrect parameter, or a misspelled comment can all trigger problems that are hard to spot. GitHub Copilot offers robust tools to help developers spot and fix these issues early.

## Why It Matters

Even minor typos can cause bugs or slow down your development process. Integrating typo checks into your workflow helps ensure better quality code with fewer hours wasted tracking down mistakes.

## Practical Ways to Use Copilot

### 1️⃣ GitHub Copilot Ask: Quick Proofread

- Prompt Copilot: `Review this file for typos in variable names, function names, and comments. Suggest corrections.`
- The tool assists in catching subtle naming errors that could break functionality.

### 2️⃣ Copilot Edit Mode: Spot and Fix in Place

- Highlight relevant sections.
- Prompt: `Check for typos in code and comments. Fix them.`
- Copilot corrects typos in context, preserving surrounding code.

### 3️⃣ Copilot Agent Mode: Naming Consistency Across Projects

- Prompt Copilot: `Review this repository for inconsistent naming. Suggest a consistent style for variables and functions.`
- Ideal for larger projects or teams where different naming patterns slip in over time.

## Takeaway

A quick, routine review with Copilot before committing changes can shave hours off your debugging process and improve code clarity. Adopting these habits helps keep your projects cleaner and more maintainable.
