# PagerDuty Introduces Suite of AI Agents to Enhance IT Management and DevOps Workflows

**Author:** Mike Vizard

PagerDuty has rolled out a comprehensive suite of artificial intelligence (AI) agents as part of its Fall '25 platform release. The new agents are designed to automate and optimize various aspects of IT management and DevOps workflows, helping teams reduce manual workload and operational stress.

## Key Features of PagerDuty AI Agents

- **PagerDuty Insights Agent**: Surfaces actionable answers to queries and provides recommendations to preemptively address potential IT issues.
- **PagerDuty SRE Agent (Early Access)**: Acts as a virtual site reliability engineer by generating and dynamically updating runbooks as IT environments evolve.
- **PagerDuty Scribe Agent**: Automatically transcribes Zoom calls and chat conversations, crafting structured summaries and status updates for sharing across platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams.
- **PagerDuty Shift Agent**: Detects on-call scheduling conflicts and resolves them automatically, streamlining team coordination.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server**: Makes platform-collected data available for third-party AI agents and applications, and strengthens integration with Spotify’s Backstage internal developer platform (IDP).

## Impact on DevOps Teams

David Williams, PagerDuty's SVP of Product, underscores that these advancements aim to
reduce context switching and manual toil within IT teams. By automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks, the platform lets DevOps professionals focus on higher-value activities and mitigates burnout associated with monotonous operational work.

## Broader Implications and Adoption

- **Change in DevOps Workflow**: The integration of AI agents is expected to reshape how DevOps teams are structured and operate. Teams can allocate more time for innovation and critical projects by offloading routine activities to AI.
- **Industry Trends**: While complete AI autonomy in incident management remains uncertain, many manual processes can already be effectively automated without jeopardizing overall IT operations.
- **Scalability Benefits**: Organizations constrained by operational overhead can potentially build and deploy more applications by leveraging these AI agents to reduce dependency on additional personnel.

## Outlook

The direction is clear: AI agents are fast becoming integral to modern DevOps and IT management. Early adoption is likely to drive transformation in workload management, team scalability, and employee well-being, as organizations look to automate and enhance both the speed and resilience of their technical operations.
