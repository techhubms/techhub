# Unpacking Zip Folders into Windows Long File Paths with .NET

**Author:** Rick Strahl

## Introduction

Long file paths on Windows have been a notorious challenge for developers, especially when working with .NET and file system operations. In this article, Rick Strahl demonstrates a real-world issue with using the classic `\\?\` long path prefix in combination with .NET’s `ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory()` method. The author shares troubleshooting insights, a review of the causes, and practical workarounds for handling long paths when unpacking archive files.

## The Problem: Failing with Long Paths and .NET ZipFile

If you attempt to extract a zip file whose entries will create file paths longer than the default `MAX_PATH` limit (260 characters) using code like:

```csharp
// THIS DOES NOT WORK
outputFolder = @"\\?\" + outputFolder;
ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory(zipFile, outputFolder);
```

you will quickly hit a wall: the function throws an exception when it encounters a very long path, leaving you with a **partially unpacked directory**. The error isn’t immediate; it only occurs once an entry violating the maximum path constraint is hit.

### Key takeaway

- `\\?\` long path syntax **does not work** with `ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory()`.
- You must handle exceptions and clean up leftover files if the extraction fails.

## Reviewing Long File Path Options in Windows and .NET

There are two main approaches for handling long paths on Windows:

1. **Enabling Long Path Support Globally and for Your Application**
   - Use a global Windows registry or group policy setting.
   - Add an application manifest entry to enable long paths in your .NET app.
   - For details and how-to, see: [Integrating Long Path Names in Windows Applications](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2022/Jan/03/Integrating-Long-Path-Names-in-Windows-Applications)
2. **Using `\\?\` Syntax (Long Path Prefixing)**
   - Prefix file paths with `\\?\` (local) or `\\?\UNC\` (network shares).
   - Only works for fully qualified or UNC paths; not relative paths.

#### Example: Registry and Manifest Entries

**Registry Setting:**

```reg
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem]
"LongPathsEnabled"=dword:00000001
```

**Group Policy:**

- Go to `Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Enable Win32 Long Paths`.

**Application Manifest Snippet:**

```xml
<windowsSettings xmlns:ws2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">
  <ws2:longPathAware>true</ws2:longPathAware>
</windowsSettings>
```

#### Challenge

Enabling global long path support **requires admin privilege** and isn’t possible directly from a regular application. Most users and small utilities simply can’t assume these preconditions will be met.

## Path Prefix Solution and Its Limitations

To sidestep system-wide settings, you may add the `\\?\` or `\\?\UNC\` prefix to fully-resolved file paths. However:

- All paths must be absolute, not relative.
- Some .NET APIs and external tools (like the built-in Zip handling code) may not respect the prefix.
- It complicates file access logic if your application manipulates many files or paths.

**Helper Function Example:**
Rick demonstrates adding a utility to generate long path-aware paths:

```csharp
public static string GetWindowsLongFilename(string path) {
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(path)) return path;
    string fullPath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(path);
    if (fullPath.Length < 260) return fullPath; // No need to convert
    // Fully qualified path
    if (fullPath.Length > 1 && fullPath[1] == ':')
        fullPath = @"\\?\" + fullPath;
    // UNC Path
    else if (fullPath.Length > 2 && fullPath.StartsWith(@"\\"))
        fullPath = @"\\?\UNC\" + fullPath.Substring(2);
    return fullPath;
}
```

---

## Custom Workaround: Manually Extracting Zip Files

Since the high-level `ExtractToDirectory` API fails, Rick suggests extracting entries one by one, applying the long path workaround per file.

**Sample Extraction Routine:**

```csharp
public bool ExtractZipFileToFolder(string zipFile, string outputFolder = null) {
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(outputFolder)) {
        SetError("Output folder is not specified.");
        return false;
    }
    zipFile = FileUtils.GetWindowsLongFilename(zipFile);
    using (var archive = ZipFile.OpenRead(zipFile)) {
        foreach (var entry in archive.Entries) {
            string targetPath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, entry.FullName);
            targetPath = targetPath.Replace('/', '\\'); // Windows separator
            targetPath = Path.GetFullPath(targetPath);
            var fullPath = FileUtils.GetWindowsLongFilename(targetPath);
            if (entry.FullName.EndsWith("/"))
                Directory.CreateDirectory(fullPath);
            else {
                Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(fullPath));
                entry.ExtractToFile(fullPath, overwrite: true);
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

This approach allows even deeply nested files and paths to be unpacked, even if the global long path policy is not enabled.

## Considerations and Real-world Insights

- **Avoiding long file paths is ideal, but can be difficult.** User profile nesting and application structures quickly push you past 260 characters, especially for user-generated or deeply nested structures (such as npm dependencies, documentation trees).
- **Minimizing path length is a partial fix:** Users can create deeply nested folders or long file/topical names you can’t control.

Example temp path:

```text
c:\users\MyUserName\Temp\tmpfiles\
```

- **Just because your app writes files doesn’t mean every tool can read them** unless they’re also long-path-aware.
- **Self-contained apps (like a bundled web server and viewer) are easier to manage** because both read and write with the same path logic.
- **Third-party controls (e.g., WebView2, Chromium) may support long paths**—test your setup.

---

## Example: Unpacking An Embedded Zip from an EXE

The final tool described unpacks an EXE, extracts an embedded zip, handles long paths, and cleans up as needed. Key approach:

- Verify file/folder existence.
- Extract EXE/ZIP content by offsets appropriately.
- Extract the zipped content to a folder using the manual method with long path handling per file.
- Clean up broken extractions on errors.

---

## Summary

Windows still does not enable long path support by default, which causes headaches for developers working with files and directories beyond 260 characters in path length. While system-wide enabling of long paths is possible, it’s not always under the developer’s or user’s control. As shown, handling long paths in .NET often requires low-level workaround logic, particularly for zip extraction.

Rick Strahl’s article breaks down the problems encountered, reviews enabling strategies, and suggests reusable code to work around these platform constraints in C# and .NET environments.
