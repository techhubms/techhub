# Picking the Right AI Model for Your Task

*By Randy Pagels*

Choosing the right AI model in GitHub Copilot can directly impact your development speed and code quality. This guide lays out practical strategies for optimizing your workflow by aligning Copilot’s capabilities with your needs.

## Understanding Copilot’s AI Models

- **Lightweight models**: Faster, better for quick edits and boilerplate tasks.
- **Advanced models**: Offer deeper reasoning, longer context, and are suited for complex or multi-file features.

## Matching the Model to Your Task

1. **Identify Your Plan**
   - Your available models depend on your GitHub Copilot tier: Free, Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise.
2. **Default Model (Business/Enterprise)**
   - Administrators control which models (e.g., GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4) are available.
   - Start with the default; adjust prompts for clarity.
   - For access questions, check with your admin, as premium models may be restricted.
3. **Manual Selection (Individual Plans)**
   - Free or Pro users can often select models:
     - Use a **smaller, faster model** (e.g., *o3-mini*) for quick tasks.
     - Use a **stronger model** (e.g., *Claude 3.5 Sonnet*, *o1-preview*) for complex features, multi-file work, or advanced planning.

## Best Practices

- **Compare outputs**: If you can access multiple models, run your prompt through each and compare:
  - Which model handles edge cases better?
  - Which produces cleaner, more maintainable code?
  - Which aligns best with your team's style?
- **Monitor usage**: Premium models (like GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4) may consume limited requests—keep an eye on usage if you have request ceilings.

## Quick Takeaway

- **Business/Enterprise**: Model selection is set by your admin.
- **Free/Pro**: You have more direct control to experiment.
- **Result**: Matching the model to the task makes Copilot usage faster, more reliable, and a better fit for your workflow.
