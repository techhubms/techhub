In this article, Jesse Swart's Blog discusses the practical use of GitHub Copilot for converting data exported from a table designer tool into working test files. <!--excerpt_end--> The article originates from a real client inquiry, questioning whether Copilot is capable of transforming table data into useful test files. The author points out that Copilot is indeed likely to help, provided the table designer tool can output its tables in a common textual format such as SQL, JSON, or CSV.

The workflow involves exporting the table from the designer tool in a supported format. After that, a developer can use GitHub Copilot to interpret this data and automate the creation of test files, tailored as needed for testing purposes. This can significantly speed up test setup and potentially reduce manual errors.

Jesse emphasizes that while Copilot won't replace the need for a correct export, it effectively bridges the gap by assisting in data transformation. The overall takeaway is that GitHub Copilot demonstrates versatility in daily software development tasks, especially in automating mundane yet necessary file conversions.
