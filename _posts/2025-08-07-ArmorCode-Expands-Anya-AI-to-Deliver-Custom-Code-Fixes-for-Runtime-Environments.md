# ArmorCode Expands Anya AI to Deliver Custom Code Fixes for Runtime Environments

**By Mike Vizard**  

At Black Hat USA 2025, ArmorCode announced major new capabilities for its Anya AI-powered platform aimed at improving application security and developer efficiency:

## Key Announcements

### 1. Context-Aware Code Fix Generation

- **Anya AI** can now generate suggested code fixes tailored to the specific runtime environment, increasing the accuracy and relevance of remediation suggestions for developers.
- The tool leverages data from over 40 billion findings across more than 320 integrations, enabling advanced insights for DevSecOps teams.
- The process supports review and oversight, with developers able to review and approve fixes before code is committed.

### 2. Supply Chain Module and SBOM Automation

- New module offers visibility into the full software supply chain:
  - Surfaces software component quality metrics, security assessment results, and health indicators.
  - Integrates with the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) format.
  - Automates the generation of composite Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs).
  - Supports compliance needs such as those set by the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act.

### 3. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support

- Added interoperability with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, allowing data collected and created by Anya to be accessed by external large language models (LLMs) and third-party tools.
- Enables broader use of security intelligence throughout the organization and the development lifecycle.

## DevSecOps and Security Implications

- By providing runtime-specific fix recommendations and automating patch application, Anya helps reduce the time and stress involved in application vulnerability remediation, addressing both developer productivity and security demands.
- Responds to the reality that modern AI coding tools can introduce new vulnerabilities due to poor training data, thereby driving up the need for automated, high-context remediation.
- New supply chain capabilities allow for better management of risk through visibility and automation—especially relevant as supply chain attacks rise in frequency and sophistication.

## Industry Trends: Investment in Application Security

- Futurum Group’s recent survey of cybersecurity leaders highlights software supply chain security, application security posture management (ASPM), and DevSecOps automation/orchestration as top priorities.
- Application development teams are increasingly being given responsibility—and sometimes budget—for application security, making integrated toolchains that bridge development and security critical.

## Why This Matters

- With cyber threats evolving rapidly and software supply chains growing more complex, automating effective, context-sensitive fixes and securing dependencies at each stage benefits both development and security teams.
- The Anya platform illustrates trends in leveraging AI and standard protocols to break down silos between teams, accelerate secure software delivery, and provide the foundation for compliance.
