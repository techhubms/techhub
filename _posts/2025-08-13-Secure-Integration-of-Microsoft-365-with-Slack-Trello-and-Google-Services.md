# Secure Integration of Microsoft 365 with Slack, Trello, and Google Services

**By Dellenny**

Modern organizations depend on a variety of SaaS platforms—beyond just Microsoft 365 (M365)—to fuel productivity and collaboration. Integrating tools like Slack, Trello, or Google Services with M365 can streamline workflows, but every connection introduces new security considerations.

## 1. Map the Integration Landscape

- **Inventory integrations**: List every third-party tool requiring M365 access and specify data flows (read-only, read/write).
- **Clarify ownership**: Identify whether internal teams or external vendors manage each tool.
- **Document business rationale:** Justify every connection in risk/reward terms.

## 2. Authentication Best Practices

- **Enforce OAuth 2.0**: Never use direct passwords between services. Use secure delegated access.
- **Enable SSO via Azure AD**: Centralizes access management and auditing.
- **Require MFA everywhere**: Dramatically lowers credential-theft risk.

*Example: When connecting Trello to Outlook, use “Sign in with Microsoft” and ensure MFA is applied.*

## 3. Principle of Least Privilege

- **Review requested permissions**: Don’t blindly consent to broad access; check scopes carefully.
- **Prefer granular access**: Restrict permissions to what’s absolutely necessary.
- **Ongoing review**: Regularly audit which third-party apps have access using Azure AD admin center.

*Tip: Slack integration that only posts calendar reminders doesn’t need file access permissions.*

## 4. Leverage Microsoft’s Integration Gateways

- **Power Automate**: Automate cross-platform workflows using secure templated connectors.
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Use for detailed, programmatic control over M365 data sharing.
- **AppSource marketplace**: Choose certified, Microsoft-vetted integrations.

These methods provide higher assurance than custom or ad hoc scripts.

## 5. Segment & Monitor Data Sharing

- **Conditional Access Policies**: Restrict risky sign-ins based on geography, risk signals, or device compliance.
- **Enable audit logging**: Keep records of inter-app data flows for investigation and compliance.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Define what can/can’t be transferred out of M365 (e.g., block credit cards leaving organization).

## 6. Vet Every Third-Party App

1. **Check for compliance (SOC2, ISO 27001, GDPR/CCPA, etc).**
2. **Examine security documentation**: Focus on data encryption and retention policies.
3. **Pilot new integrations**: Limit rollouts to small test groups before org-wide deployment.

## 7. User Education

- **Run awareness sessions**: Teach users to question permission prompts and overreaching requests.
- **Approval workflow**: Use a formal process for introducing new connectors/apps.
- **Send reminders about data handling policies.**

## 8. Continuous Audit

- **Quarterly reviews**: Remove stale or unused app authorizations.
- **Rotate secrets**: Change tokens, keys, and passwords regularly.
- **Track vendor advisories**: Stay current on updates or vulnerabilities for all integrated SaaS platforms.

## Step-by-Step Guidance for Common Integrations

### A. Slack + Microsoft 365

1. Use Slack’s App Directory to locate Microsoft integrations (e.g., Outlook Calendar, Teams Calls).
2. Always log in via OAuth and Microsoft Account, not passwords.
3. Limit scope of permissions, e.g., calendar access only.
4. Enable SSO and Conditional Access via Azure AD.
5. Test with pilot group, then scale.
6. Review permissions in Azure AD Enterprise Apps.

### B. Trello + Microsoft 365

1. Use Trello Power-Ups for integrations (Teams, Outlook Calendar).
2. Enforce Microsoft sign-in with MFA.
3. Use calendar subs for one-way/sync-only as a lower risk model.
4. DLP policies in M365 can monitor file exchanges to OneDrive.
5. Restrict access to specific boards/projects only.

### C. Google Services (Drive, Calendar, Gmail) + M365

1. In Google Admin, register Microsoft 365 as trusted app for SSO.
2. Use OAuth; avoid static passwords.
3. Favor Power Automate or Graph API for controlled data flows.
4. Enforce Conditional Access with MFA and approved networks.
5. Restrict Google Drive access within granular OneDrive folders.

## Summary

- Integrate with security, not at its expense.
- Prefer built-in Microsoft integrations, certified connectors, and least-privilege access.
- User education and continuous auditing are as essential as technical controls.

By following these guidelines and leveraging Microsoft’s security toolset, you can connect Slack, Trello, Google Services, and M365 confidently—without sacrificing your organization’s security.
