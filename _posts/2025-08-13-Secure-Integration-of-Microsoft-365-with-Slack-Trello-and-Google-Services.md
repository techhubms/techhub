Dellenny provides a practical walkthrough for securely integrating Microsoft 365 with third-party SaaS tools like Slack, Trello, and Google services, ensuring strong security and compliance throughout the integration process.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Secure Integration of Microsoft 365 with Slack, Trello, and Google Services

In today’s environment, organizations seldom rely solely on Microsoft 365 (M365) and regularly integrate with external SaaS tools such as Slack, Trello, and Google Workspace. Every integration increases the attack surface, so robust security practices are essential. Dellenny’s guide covers best practices and hands-on steps to ensure connected platforms remain secure and compliant.

## 1. Map the Integration Landscape

- **Inventory all external tools** requiring access to M365 resources (e.g., calendars, files, messages)
- **Determine data flows**: Identify read-only vs. read/write needs
- **Assign ownership**: Know who manages each integration (internal/external)
- **Assess business value** to weigh integration risks

## 2. Use Secure Authentication

- Prefer **OAuth 2.0** to prevent sharing of third-party credentials
- Enable **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for consistent access control
- Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all integration accounts

*Example*: For Trello integration, use “Sign in with Microsoft” rather than API keys.

## 3. Apply Least Privilege Principle

- Scrutinize requested permissions during app setup
- Grant only the minimum required access (e.g., calendar read-only over full mailbox access)
- Regularly review and prune consented apps in the Azure AD admin center

> *Tip*: If Slack only posts calendar reminders, don’t allow access to all OneDrive files.

## 4. Leverage Microsoft’s Official Connectors

- Use **Power Automate** to build secure integration workflows—no custom code needed
- Apply **Microsoft Graph API** for granular, controlled data sharing
- Install vetted solutions from the **AppSource marketplace** to ensure compliance

## 5. Monitor and Control Data Flows

- Set up **Conditional Access policies** to block risky sign-ins
- **Enable audit logging** to track data transfers between M365 and external tools
- Implement **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies** to prevent sensitive leaks

*Example*: DLP can restrict credit card info from syncing from OneDrive to Google Drive.

## 6. Vet Third-Party Apps

- Check vendor compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR/CCPA)
- Review how the vendor encrypts and stores data
- Pilot integrations with a small user group before a wide rollout

## 7. Educate and Empower Users

- Train users to recognize and question excessive permission requests
- Set up approval workflows for new integrations
- Regularly remind users about data handling requirements

## 8. Audit and Maintain Integrations

- Conduct quarterly reviews to remove unused/outdated apps
- Rotate API tokens and credentials
- Stay informed on security advisories from vendors

## Step-by-Step Examples

### **A. Slack + Microsoft 365**

1. In Slack, search the App Directory for **Microsoft Outlook Calendar** or **Teams Calls**.
2. Use Microsoft account sign-in (OAuth 2.0).
3. Approve only necessary permissions (e.g., calendar, not full mailbox).
4. Enable SSO with Azure AD.
5. Pilot the integration with a small group.
6. Review permissions in Azure AD Enterprise Apps and set Conditional Access.

### **B. Trello + Microsoft 365**

1. In Trello, use Power-Ups to find Microsoft Teams or Outlook Calendar integrations.
2. Authorize using Microsoft sign-in with MFA.
3. Use calendar subscription links for read-only access when feasible.
4. Apply DLP policies to attachments shared between Trello and OneDrive.
5. Limit Power-Up access per board/project.

### **C. Google Services + Microsoft 365**

1. In Google Workspace Admin, add Microsoft 365 as a trusted third-party SSO app.
2. Enable OAuth access only.
3. Use Power Automate or Graph API for controlled data sync.
4. Turn on Conditional Access—require MFA and network restrictions for sign-ins.
5. Grant Google Drive access only to required OneDrive folders.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Use secure authentication (OAuth2, SSO), never static passwords.
- Grant minimum necessary permissions, review frequently.
- Prefer Microsoft’s official connectors for all integrations.
- Monitor, audit, and keep users informed.

By following these steps, your organization can build a connected, productive digital workplace without undermining its security stance.
