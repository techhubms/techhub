# How IDPs, AI, and Security Are Evolving DevOps Culture

By Olivier de Turckheim

## Introduction

DevOps has shifted from proving its value to tackling complex real-world implementation challenges. As teams strive for faster releases and improved collaboration, emerging pressures—especially from AI and automation—are reshaping the boundaries of traditional DevOps.

## The Rise of Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) have emerged as key enablers, offering standardized infrastructure, consolidated tools, and automation of operational tasks. IDPs free up delivery teams from routine burdens, creating headspace for innovation—even within capacity-challenged environments. However, the journey isn’t just technical; true transformation demands cultural change through trust-building, process redesign, and sustained adaptation.

## When Interest Outpaces Action: DevSecOps and AIOps

While DevOps is now mainstream, its offshoots—DevSecOps (security integrated from day one) and AIOps (AI-powered IT operations)—are in earlier adoption phases. Many organizations recognize the logic of baking security into workflows and leveraging machine learning for anomaly detection and response, but widespread implementation is hampered by resource and integration hurdles.

Security requires not only adding new tools, but changing established workflows and empowering teams with new responsibilities. Similarly, AIOps moves from experimentation to production only when organizations build trust in the underlying data, models, and decisions, striking a balance between automated action and human oversight.

## AI Is Forcing the Security Issue

AI introduces new intelligence to operations but also brings fresh risks—such as data exposure and new attack surfaces. Poorly governed AI systems may accidentally leak sensitive information or magnify errors if not implemented with robust controls. As AI and automation become more deeply integrated, security must be embedded at every stage. DevSecOps provides the guardrails; AIOps offers adaptive intelligence.

## Deployment That Gets Out of the Way

Developer experience is shaped by how easily platforms support both legacy and cloud-native deployment approaches. Consistent, self-service interfaces—often powered by GitOps—yield visibility, traceability, and rapid rollouts. Plug-in architectures allow integration with tools for error tracking, code quality, and custom logs, providing teams immediate access to key metrics without sacrificing oversight.

## Future of AI and ML Infrastructure Ownership

As machine learning and AI shift from experiments to core business functions, DevOps and platform teams are increasingly assuming MLOps responsibilities. This change brings intersection between traditional infrastructure management and specialized tasks like model lifecycle management and performance tuning. While larger enterprises may develop MLOps specialty roles, collaboration between platform teams and data specialists ensures consistency, reduces duplication, and improves integration.

## DevOps Is Evolving – How to Stay Ahead

The next era of DevOps focuses on scaling, not selling the practice. Cultural readiness, upskilling, and unified self-service platforms are as important as the tools themselves. Best-in-class teams are integrating automation, security, and AI/ML capabilities as foundational elements. The organizations that succeed will be those that treat security as inseparable from innovation, investing early in both cultural and technical evolution.

## Key Takeaways

- IDPs enable innovation by automating and standardizing operational tasks.
- DevSecOps and AIOps require strategic, cultural, and workflow changes—not just new technology.
- Security and AI must be co-developed in operational workflows.
- GitOps and plug-in architectures improve developer experience and deployment resilience.
- MLOps responsibilities are expanding within platform and DevOps teams to accommodate AI growth.
