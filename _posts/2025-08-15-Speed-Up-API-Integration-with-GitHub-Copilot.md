Randy Pagels shares tips on using GitHub Copilot to speed up application API integration, blending Copilot's generated code with developer expertise for efficient and maintainable solutions.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Speed Up API Integration with GitHub Copilot

Connecting your application to an API is usually a repetitive task requiring careful reading of documentation, writing boilerplate code, and repeated testing. This post explains how GitHub Copilot can accelerate this process.

## Bypassing Boilerplate

GitHub Copilot generates code suggestions that can handle much of the repetitive setup efficiently. Instead of hand-writing every line when calling APIs, Copilot provides you with direct scaffolding to kickstart API integration.

> **ProTip:** Use Copilot in tandem with your knowledge of the API docs to ensure that you address edge cases Copilot may overlook.

## Example: API Call with Copilot

You can prompt Copilot with a straightforward request, such as:

```javascript
// Write a function in JavaScript that calls the OpenWeatherMap API, fetches the current temperature for a given city, and returns it in Celsius.
```

Copilot responds by generating boilerplate fetch logic, handling query parameters, and returning results. You can then refine this code using additional prompts like:

- "Add error handling if the city is not found."
- "Update the function to use async/await instead of promises."
- "Return the response as a formatted string, not just JSON."

## Iterative Refinement

By iteratively prompting Copilot, developers can get to functional and production-ready code faster, customizing Copilot's suggestions to fit specific requirements.

## Key Takeaways

- Copilot accelerates API integration by reducing manual setup
- Developer supervision ensures correct and robust implementations
- Combining AI assistance with personal expertise leads to optimal outcomes
