Randy Pagels demonstrates how GitHub Copilot helps developers speed up API integration, offering practical tips for combining AI code suggestions with their API knowledge.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Speed Up API Integration with GitHub Copilot

Connecting your application to APIs usually involves navigating documentation, writing repetitive setup code, and testing requests until you get the results you want.

With GitHub Copilot, much of this overhead can be minimized, letting developers focus on building useful features.

## Using Copilot for API Integration

- Use Copilot to suggest code for standard API tasks, such as making HTTP requests and handling common parameters.
- Always pair Copilot's output with your own understanding of the API documentation to catch edge cases or required parameters that Copilot may miss.

## Practical Example

If you want to connect to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current temperature for a specified city, you can prompt Copilot:

```javascript
// Write a function in JavaScript that calls the OpenWeatherMap API, fetches the current temperature for a given city, and returns it in Celsius.
```

Copilot will typically generate code to:

- Construct the necessary fetch logic
- Handle query parameters
- Return a structured result

You can iterate with targeted prompts, such as:

- Add error handling if the city is not found
- Update the function to use async/await
- Return the response as a formatted string instead of raw JSON

## Key Takeaways

- Iteratively refining the code using Copilot suggestions speeds up development
- You retain full control of the code and can ensure accuracy by verifying logic against official API docs
- Copilot reduces time spent on boilerplate so you can focus on the unique aspects of your project
