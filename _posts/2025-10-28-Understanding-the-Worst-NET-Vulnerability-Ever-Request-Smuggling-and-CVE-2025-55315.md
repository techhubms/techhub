# Understanding the Worst .NET Vulnerability Ever: Request Smuggling and CVE-2025-55315

Andrew Lock explores the details of the CVE-2025-55315 request smuggling vulnerability in ASP.NET Core, assigned a record-high CVSS score of 9.9 by Microsoft. This post clarifies how request smuggling works, the specifics of the discovered flaw, its impact, and the required mitigation steps.

## What Is CVE-2025-55315?

On October 14th, 2025, Microsoft patched all supported versions of .NET, releasing a security advisory about a bypass vulnerability in ASP.NET Core: [CVE-2025-55315](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033). The issue involves inconsistent HTTP request interpretation leading to possible security feature bypass via request smuggling.

Key points from the advisory:

- The bug enables HTTP Request Smuggling in ASP.NET Core.
- Attackers could log in as other users (escalation of privilege), make internal requests (SSRF), bypass CSRF, or conduct injection attacks, depending on app specifics.
- The severity was rated at 9.9 to maximize awareness and drive patch adoption due to the broad consequences.

## Request Smuggling, Explained

Request smuggling exploits the differences in how proxies and backend servers parse ambiguous or malformed HTTP requestsâ€”allowing an attacker to "smuggle" a malicious request past a front-end server.

Example scenario:

- An HTTP request with two different `Content-Length` headers causes the proxy and backend to interpret the end of the request differently.
- The backend parses a hidden second request not seen by the proxy, potentially bypassing authentication or other controls.

The post provides code-level examples and references [PortSwigger's documentation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting) for more practical attack variations.

## Exploitation Potential

If exploited, request smuggling could allow attackers to:

- Steal other users' credentials or session data
- Poison caches or reflect malicious data
- Access endpoints that should be blocked by proxies
- Inject malicious headers

Severity depends on an application's structure and any custom handling of HTTP requests.

## The ASP.NET Core / CVE-2025-55315 Vulnerability

This CVE leverages ambiguity in parsing chunked transfer encoding with chunk extensions.

- Older ASP.NET Core versions were lenient, skipping lines ending with just `\n`.
- Different handling between proxies and Kestrel could allow request smuggling, bypassing proxy security rules.

The post details the vulnerable implementation and how malformed chunk extensions could trigger the vulnerability.

## Who Is Affected? What Should You Do?

- **Affected:** All unpatched versions of .NET 8 and above, plus earlier versions (no official fixes for versions <8, except via HeroDevs support).
- **Mitigation:** Update ASP.NET Core to patched releases (see [official issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033) for version specifics).
- **If you cannot patch:** Use a patched proxy (e.g., Azure App Services have applied mitigations); consider enforcing use of HTTP/2/3.
- **Testing:** Check your runtime version with `dotnet --info` and review HeroDevs' [testing repo](https://github.com/sirredbeard/CVE-2025-55315-repro) for exploit scripts.

## Technical Details

- The fix enforces strict parsing of chunk extensions, rejecting standalone line feeds (`\n`) in chunk headers.
- Applications manipulating `HttpRequest.Body` or acting as custom proxies may be at increased risk.
- The vulnerability does not affect HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.

## Action Items for Developers

- **Patch immediately** to the latest supported .NET/ASP.NET Core release.
- **If unsupported,** consider HeroDevs for extended patching, or apply a secure, patched proxy.
- **Review custom code** that processes HTTP requests or acts as a proxy within ASP.NET Core.
- Stay alert for further advisories by watching the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033).
