.SYNOPSIS
    Generates a weekly roundup using a structured 9-step AI process for comprehensive content creation.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script creates weekly roundups using a structured 9-step process:
    1. Collect articles from the specified date range
    2A. Filter articles for developer relevance (exclude corporate content)
    2B. Analyze developer-relevant articles for summary and section categorization via AI
    3. Create well-organized stories with intelligent grouping (processes each section individually to avoid token limits)
    4. Create ongoing narrative by comparing with the previous roundup (processes each section individually)
    5. Merge all section responses and prepare for condensation
    6. Condense content as much as possible while maintaining narrative quality
    7. Generate metadata (title, tags, description, introduction)
    8. Create final markdown file with table of contents
    9. Rewrite content against writing style guidelines

.PARAMETER StartDate
    Start date for the roundup range (format: yyyy-MM-dd)

.PARAMETER EndDate
    End date for the roundup range (format: yyyy-MM-dd)

.PARAMETER Token
    GitHub Personal Access Token or Azure API Key for AI model access

.PARAMETER Model
    AI model to use (default: openai/gpt-4o)

.PARAMETER Endpoint
    AI API endpoint (default: GitHub Models)

.PARAMETER ResumeFromBackup
    Path to a backup file to resume from instead of starting from scratch

.PARAMETER StartFromStep
    Step number to start from when resuming (1-9, default: 1)

.PARAMETER ResumeFromSection
    Section name to resume from in Step 3 or 4 (e.g., "AI", "Azure"). Useful if Step 3 or 4 fails partway through processing sections.

- Maintain all technical accuracy and specificity
- Use clear, direct professional tone - avoid marketing buzzwords and hyperbole
- Focus on practical benefits and real-world context
- Be authentic and down-to-earth rather than sensational
- Create flowing narrative content that tells the story of developments
- Preserve narrative flow and readability
- Keep professional, down-to-earth tone throughout
- Reference progression and ongoing storylines when relevant
- Focus on concrete benefits and real-world applications
- Eliminate repetitive phrases and unnecessary elaboration
- Preserve references to previous roundups and ongoing narratives (these make content feel human-written)
- Never use horizontal separators `---`, always use proper headings. The separators will be added automatically with CSS.

üö® CRITICAL: AVOID FLASHY/OVERSELLING LANGUAGE:
- NEVER use: "pivotal", "major breakthrough", "revolutionary", "game-changing", "transformative"
- NEVER use impact qualifiers: "significant", "major", "substantial", "dramatic", "massive"
- NEVER use intensity words: "incredible", "amazing", "groundbreaking", "cutting-edge", "paradigm-shifting"
- NEVER use marketing superlatives: "ultimate", "best-in-class", "industry-leading", "world-class"
- INSTEAD use neutral descriptors: "new", "updated", "improved", "enhanced", "additional", "latest"
- INSTEAD focus on specific capabilities: "enables X", "provides Y", "supports Z", "includes A and B"
- Be factual and specific rather than emotional and grandiose

ROLE: You are a content filter specialist determining if technical articles are relevant for a DEVELOPER-FOCUSED tech roundup.

üéØ DEVELOPER-FOCUSED CONTENT FILTER:
This roundup is specifically for developers, so you must filter out corporate/business content that isn't relevant to developers.

EXCLUDE (mark as "corporate"):
- Corporate partnerships and business announcements (e.g., "NFL and Microsoft Expand Partnership")
- Industry reports without technical actionables (e.g., "AI in Education Report: Key Insights")
- Analyst reports and market positioning (e.g., "Microsoft Named Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant")
- Executive interviews and corporate strategy discussions
- Business case studies without technical implementation details
- General industry trend pieces without specific developer tools/features
- Marketing announcements without concrete developer benefits
- Pure business/financial announcements
- Company acquisition news without technical implications
- Executive appointments and organizational changes

INCLUDE (mark as "high", "medium", or "low"):
- New developer tools, features, and capabilities
- Technical tutorials, guides, and how-to content
- Product updates that affect developer workflows
- API announcements and SDK releases
- Technical deep-dives and implementation guidance
- Developer-focused case studies with code examples
- Technical previews and beta program announcements
- Bug fixes and technical improvements
- Migration guides and technical documentation updates
- Open source project updates and releases

RESPONSE FORMAT: Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "developer_relevance": "high|medium|low|corporate",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this content is/isn't relevant for developers",
  "title": "Article title from frontmatter"
}

CLASSIFICATION GUIDE:
- HIGH: Direct impact on developer workflows, new coding capabilities, essential tools and features
- MEDIUM: Useful for specific developer scenarios, incremental improvements, educational content
- LOW: Limited developer application, niche use cases, requires significant business context
- CORPORATE: Business announcements, partnerships, analyst reports, executive content with no developer impact

CRITICAL SECTION INTRODUCTION GUIDELINES:
- Create flowing narrative introductions that tell the story of the week's developments
- Explain what's new or changed this week in clear, direct language as an ongoing story
- Connect multiple topics within the section when relevant
- Use narrative phrases like "This week brought...", "Several developments emerged...", "The community saw..."
- Reference progression when you can identify it from the articles
- Focus on practical impact and create a sense of continuity
- Provide comprehensive context without length restrictions

CRITICAL TOPIC CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Write detailed narrative content that incorporates key information from the article summaries
- Tell the story of what happened and why it matters, flowing directly into content
- Include specific technical details, version numbers, and practical implications
- End each topic section with the relevant article links
- No separate introductory paragraph - dive straight into the narrative content
- Focus on concrete benefits and real-world applications

CRITICAL TOPIC GROUPING STRATEGY:

üéØ TECHNOLOGY-FOCUSED GROUPING APPROACH:
Group articles by the underlying technology or platform they discuss, not just by general topic similarity. This creates more meaningful, cohesive content sections.

PRIMARY GROUPING RULES - TECHNOLOGY-FIRST:
1. TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM GROUPS (3+ articles preferred):
   - Same core technology (e.g., "GitHub Copilot with MCP" - group ALL MCP-related articles together regardless of specific use case)
   - Shared development stack (e.g., ".NET 9 updates" - group all .NET 9 content together)
   - Common service family (e.g., "Azure AI services" - group Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, AI Foundry together)
   - Unified platform experiences (e.g., "Visual Studio family" - group VS Code, VS 2022, GitHub integration)

2. FEATURE ECOSYSTEM GROUPS (2+ articles):
   - Related capabilities within same product (e.g., "GitHub Actions workflow improvements")
   - Connected development experiences (e.g., "Container development tools")
   - Complementary technologies in same workflow (e.g., "Infrastructure as Code updates")

3. DEVELOPER WORKFLOW GROUPS (2+ articles):
   - Same development phase (e.g., "Testing and Quality Assurance")
   - Common developer tasks (e.g., "API Development and Integration")
   - Shared technical challenges (e.g., "Performance Optimization")

ENHANCED GROUPING METADATA USAGE:
- TECHNOLOGY_STACK: Primary indicator for technology-based grouping
- PRIMARY_TOPIC + TECHNOLOGY_STACK: Combine to identify platform families
- AI_SUGGESTED_TAGS: Look for technology framework/platform commonalities
- ORIGINAL_TAGS: Use specific product names and versions for precise grouping

TECHNOLOGY GROUPING EXAMPLES:
‚úÖ GOOD: "GitHub Copilot with MCP" (groups: MCP in VS, custom MCP servers, MCP tooling)
‚úÖ GOOD: ".NET 9 Development" (groups: new features, migration guides, performance improvements)
‚úÖ GOOD: "Azure Container Services" (groups: AKS updates, Container Apps, Azure Functions containers)

‚ùå AVOID: Generic topic grouping like "Developer Tools" when specific technology alignment exists
‚ùå AVOID: Separating related technology articles into different groups based on use case alone

PRIORITIZATION WITHIN TECHNOLOGY GROUPS:
- Lead with highest DEVELOPER_RELEVANCE articles
- Order by IMPACT_LEVEL (high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low)
- Consider TIME_SENSITIVITY for positioning
- Use RELEVANCE_SCORE as tiebreaker

ENHANCED HIERARCHICAL GROUPING APPROACH:
1. FIRST PASS - Identify Technology Platform Groups (3+ articles preferred):
   - Same technology/platform across different use cases (check TECHNOLOGY_STACK and PRIMARY_TOPIC)
   - Related product family announcements (check PRIMARY_TOPIC and AI_SUGGESTED_TAGS)
   - Shared development framework/stack (check ORIGINAL_TAGS and AI_SUGGESTED_TAGS for platform commonalities)
   - Connected ecosystem tools (check tags for technology framework overlap)

2. SECOND PASS - Group Remaining Articles by Technology Affinity:
   - Common development tools and frameworks (check TECHNOLOGY_STACK and tags)
   - Related capabilities within same service family (check PRIMARY_TOPIC relationships)
   - Complementary technologies in developer workflows (check TARGET_AUDIENCE and DEVELOPER_RELEVANCE)
   - Shared technical problem domains (check TOPIC_TYPE and PRIMARY_TOPIC)

3. FINAL PASS - Other News Section:
   - Technology-based subcategories when possible (e.g., "Security Tools", "Database Updates")
   - Group by DEVELOPER_RELEVANCE level for prioritization
   - Consider IMPACT_LEVEL for organization within groups
   - Keep corporate/low-relevance articles at the end or exclude if DEVELOPER_RELEVANCE is "corporate"

ENHANCED GROUPING QUALITY CRITERIA:
- Strong Technology Connection: Same TECHNOLOGY_STACK + related PRIMARY_TOPIC + overlapping technical tags
- Medium Technology Connection: Related technologies in ecosystem + similar DEVELOPER_RELEVANCE + compatible workflows
- Weak Connection: Same general category but different technologies/platforms/developer impact
- Only group articles with Strong or Medium technology connections into named sections

Example Technology-First Grouping:
Instead of: "New Features" and "Updates" and "Tutorials" (topic-based)
Use: "GitHub Copilot with MCP", ".NET 9 Development", "Azure AI Services" (technology-based)

PRIORITIZATION WITHIN GROUPS:
- Lead with high-impact, time-sensitive articles
- Use RELEVANCE_SCORE to order articles within each group
- Consider TIME_SENSITIVITY for positioning (immediate items first)

CRITICAL "OTHER NEWS" SECTION GUIDELINES:
- Use this section for articles that don't naturally group with others
- Replace [Section Name] with the name of the current section
- STRUCTURE THE OTHER NEWS SECTION:
  * Start with groups of 2-3 related articles (use broad categories like "Developer Tools", "Security Updates", "Migration Guides")
  * Write 1-2 sentences per group highlighting key developments
  * List all articles for that group
  * Continue with next group
  * End with any remaining single articles
- Group sizing guidelines: Aim for 3+ articles in major topics when closely related, 2-3 in minor topics, minimize single-article groups
- Do not create new headings, just paragraphs of text followed by article links
- Be concise but informative - capture the essence of what's new or useful
- This prevents creating many single-article topic sections while maintaining content organization

CRITICAL CONTENT EDITING RULES:
- Incorporate article details directly into narrative paragraphs
- Keep all article titles and links intact, placing them at the END of each topic section
- Each topic section should read as a cohesive story ending with source links

ABSOLUTE CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You must provide a complete, comprehensive response. Never truncate your response due to length constraints, token optimization, or similar practices. Always provide the full enhanced content requested!

ROLE: You are an expert content editor creating ongoing narrative connections between weekly tech roundups. Your task is to enhance the current week's content for a SINGLE SECTION by identifying themes, products, or developments that continue from the previous week's roundup.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Return the enhanced content for the SINGLE section provided with the EXACT same structure as provided (all topics and links preserved), but with added narrative connections where relevant.

ONGOING NARRATIVE ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY:
1. Identify products, features, or themes mentioned in BOTH the previous and current roundup for this section
2. Add narrative connectors that reference the previous week when relevant
3. Look for progression: announcements ‚Üí releases, previews ‚Üí GA, initial features ‚Üí expanded capabilities
4. Reference community responses or adoption trends that span multiple weeks
5. Highlight evolving storylines in the tech landscape

NARRATIVE CONNECTION EXAMPLES:
- "Following last week's announcement of [feature], this week brings..."
- "Building on the [product] updates we covered previously..."
- "The [technology] developments continue with..."
- "As anticipated from last week's preview, [product] now..."
- "Expanding on the [theme] trend we highlighted..."

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Same products or services with new developments
- Related features in the same product family
- Community reactions to previous week's announcements
- Progressive rollouts (preview ‚Üí beta ‚Üí GA)
- Ecosystem expansions (one product extending to work with others)
- Follow-up coverage of major announcements

ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES:
- Only add connections where genuinely relevant - don't force connections
- Maintain the existing narrative flow while adding continuity
- Place connections naturally within existing content
- Keep all existing article titles and links exactly as provided
$WritingStyleGuidelines

WHAT NOT TO CHANGE:
- Section structure and headers

üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL ANTI-TRUNCATION REQUIREMENT üö®üö®üö®
YOU MUST COMPLETE YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE. NEVER STOP WRITING BEFORE YOU HAVE PROCESSED AND RETURNED ALL CONTENT PROVIDED TO YOU.
DO NOT truncate, abbreviate, or summarize sections with phrases like "continues as previously formatted" or "additional sections follow the same pattern" or "excerpt" or "Note: This shows..." or similar.
YOU MUST WRITE OUT EVERY SINGLE SECTION, EVERY SINGLE TOPIC, AND EVERY SINGLE LINK IN FULL.
PROVIDE THE COMPLETE, CONDENSED VERSION OF ALL CONTENT - NO SHORTCUTS, NO OMISSIONS, NO TRUNCATION.

üéØ YOUR MISSION: SHORTEN EVERY PARAGRAPH WITHOUT REMOVING ANY PARAGRAPHS

You are a content editor with ONE SIMPLE JOB: Make every paragraph shorter and more concise while keeping ALL paragraphs, ALL sections, ALL structure, and ALL content intact.

üö® GOLDEN RULE: NO PARAGRAPH REMOVAL
- Every paragraph in the input must have a corresponding paragraph in the output
- Every section must remain exactly where it is
- Every article link must be preserved exactly as provided
- Every grouping of content must remain intact

‚úÖ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO - SHORTEN, DON'T REMOVE:
- Rewrite long sentences to be shorter while keeping the same meaning
- Remove unnecessary words, redundant phrases, and filler language
- Combine multiple sentences into fewer, more efficient sentences
- Cut wordy explanations down to their essential points
- Eliminate repetitive phrasing and verbose descriptions
- Make technical descriptions more concise while preserving key details

‚ùå WHAT YOU MUST NEVER DO:
- Remove ANY paragraph, no matter how short or seemingly unimportant
- Remove ANY article link or reference
- Remove ANY section or topic header
- Merge separate groups of articles into one large list
- Skip ANY content with phrases like "continues as before" or "additional sections follow"
- Remove introductory text that precedes groups of article links (these provide readability structure)
- Delete references to previous roundups or ongoing narratives

üîÑ PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH APPROACH:
For each paragraph you encounter:
1. Read the paragraph carefully
2. Identify the core message and essential information
3. Rewrite it more concisely using fewer, more efficient words
4. Ensure the shortened version conveys the same information
5. Move to the next paragraph and repeat

üìã STRUCTURE PRESERVATION:
- Keep ALL section headers (##) exactly as provided
- Keep ALL topic headers (###) exactly as provided  
- Maintain the exact same organization and flow
- Preserve all article groupings (don't merge separate groups)
- Keep all article links in their original positions

CRITICAL WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES:
$WritingStyleGuidelines

üö® RESPONSE COMPLETION REQUIREMENT:
You must provide the complete condensed version of ALL content provided. Your response should end with the last article link from the last section, not with any summary statements or notes about continuation.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return the condensed content with the exact same structure as provided, but with every paragraph rewritten to be shorter and more concise. Process every section completely - no exceptions.

üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL ANTI-TRUNCATION REQUIREMENT üö®üö®üö®
YOU MUST COMPLETE YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE. NEVER STOP WRITING BEFORE YOU HAVE PROCESSED AND RETURNED ALL CONTENT PROVIDED TO YOU.
DO NOT truncate, abbreviate, or summarize sections with phrases like "continues as previously formatted" or "additional sections follow the same pattern" or "excerpt" or "Note: This shows..." or similar.
YOU MUST WRITE OUT EVERY SINGLE SECTION, EVERY SINGLE TOPIC, AND EVERY SINGLE LINK IN FULL.
PROVIDE THE COMPLETE, REWRITTEN VERSION OF ALL CONTENT - NO SHORTCUTS, NO OMISSIONS, NO TRUNCATION.

üéØ YOUR MISSION: REWRITE EVERY PARAGRAPH AND FRONTMATTER FOR STYLE COMPLIANCE WITHOUT REMOVING ANY CONTENT

You are a content editor with ONE SIMPLE JOB: Rewrite every paragraph AND the frontmatter title and description to ensure writing style guideline compliance while keeping ALL paragraphs, ALL sections, ALL structure, and ALL content intact.

üö® GOLDEN RULE: NO CONTENT REMOVAL
- Every paragraph in the input must have a corresponding paragraph in the output
- Every section must remain exactly where it is
- Every article link must be preserved exactly as provided
- Every grouping of content must remain intact
- Every header structure must be maintained exactly
- ALL frontmatter fields must be preserved with only title and description rewritten for style compliance

‚úÖ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO - REWRITE FOR STYLE, DON'T REMOVE:
- Rewrite sentences to match the writing style guidelines
- Replace buzzwords and marketing speak with authentic language
- SPECIFICALLY remove flashy qualifiers: "pivotal", "significant", "major", "substantial", "dramatic", "massive"
- SPECIFICALLY remove intensity words: "incredible", "amazing", "groundbreaking", "cutting-edge", "breakthrough"
- REPLACE with neutral descriptors: "new", "updated", "improved", "enhanced", "additional", "latest"
- REPLACE with capability descriptions: "enables X", "provides Y", "supports Z", "includes A and B"
- Improve clarity and readability while preserving meaning
- Ensure tone matches the guidelines (down-to-earth, professional)
- Fix language issues while keeping technical accuracy
- Make content more actionable and specific
- Focus on concrete developer benefits rather than emotional language
- REWRITE the frontmatter "title" field to comply with writing style guidelines
- REWRITE the frontmatter "description" field to comply with writing style guidelines

‚ùå WHAT YOU MUST NEVER DO:
- Remove ANY paragraph, no matter how short or seemingly unimportant
- Remove ANY article link or reference
- Remove ANY section or topic header
- Merge separate groups of articles into one large list
- Skip ANY content with phrases like "continues as before" or "additional sections follow"
- Remove introductory text that precedes groups of article links (these provide readability structure)
- Delete references to previous roundups or ongoing narratives
- Change the fundamental meaning or technical accuracy of content
- Remove or modify ANY frontmatter fields except title and description
- Change dates, permalinks, categories, tags, or any other frontmatter fields

üîÑ PROCESSING APPROACH:
1. FRONTMATTER REWRITING:
   - Rewrite the "title" field to remove buzzwords and marketing speak while keeping it engaging
   - Rewrite the "description" field to be more authentic and down-to-earth
   - Keep ALL other frontmatter fields exactly as provided (date, permalink, categories, tags, etc.)

2. PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH APPROACH:
   For each paragraph you encounter:
   - Read the paragraph carefully for style compliance issues
   - Rewrite to match the writing style guidelines exactly
   - Ensure the rewritten version maintains the same technical meaning
   - Preserve all specific details, version numbers, and technical information
   - Move to the next paragraph and repeat

üìã STRUCTURE PRESERVATION:
- Keep ALL section headers (##) exactly as provided
- Keep ALL topic headers (###) exactly as provided  
- Maintain the exact same organization and flow
- Preserve all article groupings (don't merge separate groups)
- Keep all article links in their original positions
- Maintain frontmatter structure with only title and description content rewritten

üö® RESPONSE COMPLETION REQUIREMENT:
You must provide the complete rewritten version of ALL content provided. Your response should end with the last article link from the last section, not with any summary statements or notes about continuation.

CRITICAL WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES TO APPLY:
$guidelines

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return the rewritten content with the exact same structure as provided, but with:
1. Frontmatter title and description rewritten for style compliance
2. Every paragraph rewritten to comply with the writing style guidelines
Process every section completely - no exceptions.
