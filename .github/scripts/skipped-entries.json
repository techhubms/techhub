There is no discussion of developer tooling, APIs, code, integration for custom apps, or technical implementation relevant to Microsoft consultants, developers, or technical architects. Content about consumer-facing Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and general product experience is explicitly excluded by the Copilot Product Distinction and Non-Development Products rules (see Chapter 3).",

The use of Microsoft 365 Copilot marks it as a business productivity tool, which falls under the explicit non-development products exclusion in Chapter 3. The description highlights usage patterns and interfaces for end-users rather than technical implementation, coding, or development-related content. There are no clear indications of developer-focused topics, configuration, architecture, or technical depth involving Microsoft technologies in a way that qualifies for the 'AI,' 'Coding,' 'Azure,' 'DevOps,' 'ML,' or 'Security' categories. The references to form automation and agent setup walkthroughs appear to be demonstrations of business process enhancement, not developer/architectural guidance. Per Copilot product distinction rules, all business productivity Copilot content is excluded."
