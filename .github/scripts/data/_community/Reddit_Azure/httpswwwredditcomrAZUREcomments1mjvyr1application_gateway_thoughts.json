  "EnhancedContent": "Hi all,\n\nWe are reviewing our integration strat, where we are thinking about funnelling all internal and external APIs via Azure API Management Services (APIM). We have reviewed the Microsoft recommended architecture for this and it seems they want you to put an Application Gateway in front of APIM for this, with WAF enabled. Given the way some businesses are structured, you could end up with multiple APIM instances, with multiple App Gateways. It feels like it can get unmanageable and costly quite quickly. Keen to hear thoughts from other people who have been on this journey and have deployed something for their needs. Is there something/an alternative instead of needing App Gateway for the protection element here?\n\nApp Gateway is among the most common resources we deploy and most clients need only one. I can’t see several of them being needed unless you have a multi-region scenario with low latency requirements. It’s definitely pricey and have a steep learning curve, but really difficult to replace it with anything else so it’s pretty much in every connectivity landing zone we have.\n\nAsking out of curiosity and willing to learn, if you have AKS do you deploy for each cluster dedicated AppGw or you use shared AppGw for multiple clusters? Cheers\n\nThanks the reply, if you look at the microsoft recommended architecture for deployment, you end up with one per service, per environment.\n\nI generally use 1 app gateway per landing zone and use it for all inbound public traffic. I actually route the traffic also through azure firewall before it gets to the backend.\n\nUse Azure Front Door and its WAF instead\n\nFront Door has benefits such as certs. If you have internal mode API Management though, it requires you to have AppGw, as FD can’t privatelink to it.\n\nHave a client had a bad outage with Front Door and they lost trust in it. They were already using Cloudflare Zero Trust for internal apps, so just switched to Cloudflare Tunnels for public apps. So it goes Cloudflare &gt; API Management &gt; AKS, with only a public IP on Azure Firewall. Works well for them and saved them about 20k a year.\n\nAG with WAF is one of the most costly resources in Azure, highly recommend to do some cost estimations before going down this path. Another alternative is utilizing FD WAF capabilities, this is usually more cost friendly.\n\nThe agw and apim have plenty of capacity and scaling. You can run them as shared services. You can manage your WAF policy and endpoint config as code and for apim there is API Ops.\n\nWe just use single Front Door instance split to \"environments\" by domains/endpoints. IMO FD is much nicer to work with than AGW though as it is distributed globally, some things might take a while to sync up.\n\nYou do not have to use Azure Application Gateway in front of APIM, its just one of Microsoft’s recommended patterns for adding WAF and centralised routing.",
