AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate is a direct prerequisite for it so between the two of them you've covered *creating* solutions and *administrating* them.\n\nI usually say AZ-900 &gt; AZ-104 &gt; AZ-305 is your general-purpose, \"I can do Azure, me\" progression plan to cast as wide a net as possible. It's very \"jack of all trades\" and definitely still has gaps, but you can't say you don't know your way around the platform after that.",
