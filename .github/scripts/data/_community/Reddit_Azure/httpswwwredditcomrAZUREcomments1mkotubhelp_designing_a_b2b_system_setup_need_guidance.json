  "EnhancedContent": "Hey folks, I‚Äôve been tasked with designing a full B2B system setup and I‚Äôm deep in research mode. The scope includes:\n\n- Reviewal process\n- Lifecycle handling\n- Revocation workflows\n- Grouping/categorization\n- Conditional Access policies for external users\n- Integration with **ServiceNow** for creation, revocation, extension, and reactivation\n\nI‚Äôm still new to this, so I‚Äôm gathering as much info as possible before finalizing the workflow. If you‚Äôve worked on similar setups or have tips, best practices, **and real-world tips** or lessons learned, I‚Äôd love to hear from you! **setup suggestions, best practices, real-world tips or even fail stories I could learn from I would still like to hear them all**. I‚Äôm especially curious about how you handled Conditional Access for external users and how you structured your ServiceNow flows.\n\nThanks in advance! üôè\n\nSince ChatGPT wrote your post, ask it for advice too.\n\nsorry I had to use chat gpt since english is not my first language and I'm anxious for grammatical errors and i would like to have many engagement as much as possible so I asked copilot to rephrase for me. but kuddos for the catch\n\nSounds like a task from an interview process.\n\nactually this is not an interview question. it was an actual request. no one wants to do it so I've braven up and raised my hand but told them I haven't done this before but supporting MIM for 10 years and I've more than passed my fundamentals can help me but will still need help with others. and they approved and supported.\n\n> > >\n> tasked with designing a full B2B system\n> > > >\n\nand\n\n> > >\n> I‚Äôm still new to this\n> > > >\n\nWhat could go wrong.\n\nI always love when I'm asked to perform open heart surgery to I can start googling on how the surgeries are done.\n\nJokes aside. Hire someone to help you out, getting advice from people who have literally zero accountability over the recommendations and decisions will end up badly. Especially because you are asking about designing enterprise ready system while providing actual requirements. Just some generic prompts.\n\nIt's like asking what are the best practices when building house. You will get equally generic advices. Build it secure, with power, water and windows and pipes. Make sure it's level and no holes.\n\nI just wanted to have some short answers of suggestions and or warnings or something. although I would really appreciate if someone send in a link of a whole b2b system I can reference.\n\nI think all needs to be new to something before they can be expert. I just wanted to gather all possible infos I can get from everywhere so I may know all my possible options and if possible all the tips and warnings I can get before creating just a workflow and not even implementing the setup yet\n\nI get it that my question is asking too much or very demanding and stating that I'm new to this means it will more likely double the complexity of this.\n\nbut the truth is, I understand the b2b system. we already have a b2b system it's just that it's not that regulated or monitored. there are no proper design or even a documentation so I just wanted to clean it and fix it while learning doing it.\n\nof course we have some senior and architects that helps me with this but I wanted to check the forums,internet, even facebook groups what data or suggestions I can get so I can also suggest in the design planning.\n\nI hope this will clear up somethings. and hopefully you can understand my thoughts and the tone is kind as I have type this without an AI to check the tone or meaning",
