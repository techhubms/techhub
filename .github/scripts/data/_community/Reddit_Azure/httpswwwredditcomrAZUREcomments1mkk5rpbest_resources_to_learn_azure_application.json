Are there any tutorials, guides, or personal experiences you can share on setting up effective logging and telemetry? Any suggestions or recommendations would be super helpful! Thanks!\n\nLog custom information only when there's a high probability that it would be useful in troubleshooting an issue. Pick a sampling rate that matches your needs. There's no reason to log absolutely every piece of information that is available. Generally, averages are enough for meaningful telemetry. It costs the same to store data for 6 months as it does for 1 month, so store it for 6. Custom metrics are very cool and can provide valuable insight into an applications workflow. App insights is terribly expensive when compared to other solutions like data dog so use it with specific intentions in mind instead of opening the flood gates.\n\nStep 1: Ensure you have daily ingestion limits set, Step 2: It doesn't really matter as long as you have done Step 1\n\nTake sampling seriously.\n\nAt scale, configuring sampling correctly (upsampling useful info vs downsampling useless ones) makes and breaks your troubleshooting outcomes.\n\nOpen telemetry is the new standard in the industry for logs, metrics, and traces. The azure monitor SDK is built on top of the open telemetry SDK. I prefer to use the regular open telemetry SDK but the azure monitor SDK integrates with application insights easier.\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-enable?tabs=aspnetcore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-enable?tabs=aspnetcore)\n\n[https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/dotnet/](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/dotnet/)\n\nPlus if you working in distributed applications, Aspire has first class support for open telemetry. The Aspire dashboard is so popular Microsoft made a container image for the dashboard.\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/overview?tabs=bash](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/overview?tabs=bash)\n\nEither SDK has solid auto instrumentation with good defaults. See what logs are provided by default and plug in where needed. The dotnet YouTube channel just released a series about adding custom metrics, logs, and traces through open telemetry and to the aspire dashboard.",
