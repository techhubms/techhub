  "EnhancedContent": "\\*\\*Summary\\*\\*:\n\nI want to initiate a support request to transfer an Orphaned Azure Subscription to my client where the original Owner is no longer reachable. No one else has Owner roles, and my client is a Reader (despite also paying for the service) and I've been made a Guest. We attempted to fill out a support request but were denied before the final step because my client (Reader) does not have support request privileges.\n\n\\*\\*Problem\\*\\*:\n\nBecause we don’t have the required permissions, we cannot submit a support ticket via the portal, and every support path Microsoft suggests redirects us to a place that requires those same permissions — creating a dead end.\n\n\\*\\*What We've Tried\\*\\*:\n\n- Called Azure support (disconnected after long hold twice)\n\n- Tried all support submission paths (portal blocks us)\n\n- Attempted to use “Contact Us” on [azure.microsoft.com](http://azure.microsoft.com)\n\n- Read all documentation on orphaned subscriptions and role assignments\n\n- Client is the legal IP owner and has been paying the bills\n\n\\*\\*Request\\*\\*:\n\nIs there \\*any\\* process or escalation path we can follow from outside the portal to initiate a subscription ownership transfer or recovery?\n\nOnce we're actually speaking with support from Azure, we can provide:\n\n- Proof of business ownership\n\n- IP ownership contracts\n\n- Proof of payment history\n\nTry elevating access for entra global admin so you can regain subscription access\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin?$WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003556)\n\nper doc, elevating access was created for scenarios like the one you are in\n\n> > >\n> Regain access to an Azure subscription or management group when a user has lost access\n> > > >\n\nDo you have any user with Global Admin access at the tenant level?\n\nIf you go to the tenant properties tab on the Overview blade for Entra ID. There is a feature flag that is labelled something like “Bob Example ([bob@example.com](mailto:bob@example.com)) can manage access to all Azure subscriptions and management groups in this tenant”\n\nWhoever pays the bills should have a contact at microsoft who can assist if you don’t have GA available\n\nHad similar issue. Solution (suggested by ms support itself) was to create ticket targeting different subscription, but mentioning we want to deal with the orphaned one.\n\nMicrosoft Gold Partner : [https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership/find-a-partner](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership/find-a-partner)\n\nor Microsoft MVP and LinkedIn : [https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/search?target=Profile&program=MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/search?target=Profile&amp;program=MVP)",
