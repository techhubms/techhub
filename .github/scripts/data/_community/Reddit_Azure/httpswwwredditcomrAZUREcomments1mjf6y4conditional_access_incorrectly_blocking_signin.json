  "EnhancedContent": "As per the image, CA is blocking a sign-in due to one of the IPs \"not matching\" even though it is located in the same city as the second IP that does match.\n\nThis happened to a number of users but magically resolved itself and is now only impacting one.\n\nNo idea what would be causing this so any help is welcome.\n\nYou can open a ticket on it but City level matching is SUPER unreliable\n\nGeolocation isn't accurate.\n\nCity matching is at the mercy of whatever geo-ip provider Azure decides to use. I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nThat's what I was going to say. At least in Mexico, ISP providers give you an IP in other cities.\n\nCity level? That's wild ðŸ¤¡\n\nGeo location, especially so course as city is unreliable, also its totally bypassed by anyone on a IPv6 network\n\nWhat are you trying to achieve with this CAP? If these are office locations for instance why don't you create 2 locations and exclude them from the policy? This way you can blocking anything else.\n\nWhy are you Geo locating at city level? Genuinely asking, was it just a thing that they only expected from that City?\n\nMicrosoft has a hard time with IPv6 Geo locating. I wouldn't trust it to get IPv4 City locating correct either\n\nWhat the heck is the use case for city matching? Why wouldnâ€™t you just use risky sign in detection?\n\nZscaler or other proxies will cause this if you have strict evaluation on for continuous access evaluation",
