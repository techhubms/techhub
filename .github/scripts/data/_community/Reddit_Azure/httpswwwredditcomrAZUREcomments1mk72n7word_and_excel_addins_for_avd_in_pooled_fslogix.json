  "FeedLevelAuthor": "Microsoft Azure",
  "EnhancedContent": "Hello. We need to get some plugins to work in an AVD environment for Word and Excel. This environment is using FSLogix shared among several AVD sessions hosts in a pooled. If we look at the registry key for each user, it appears that the Office key and subtrees are not in the HKLU tree. Typically, the addins would be in that tree so I assume this has something to do with FSLogix pooled storage.\n\nIn a pooled environment, is it possible to get those addins installed and the registry keys created? We attempted to do it manually, but the office applications did not recognize the addin.\n\nThanks\n\ntypically addins like that live in the users appdata folder so unless you are adding an exclusion for it in the redirections.xml file it will exist in the FSLogix mounted vhdx file and roam with the user.\n\nJust install it in user context and you're done, assuming the statement above is accurate as you can change the default install location for addins.\n\nThanks. The addin folder is actually installed as part of a lob software solution installed locally on each host. That is not the issue as I can tell. The problem appears to be that the office software installed on the AVDs does have the typical HKCU registry tree. The office key does not even exist. And under that tree is the registry settings that contain the settings for the addin typically. So there must be a different location where those entries exist. I will need to go hunting",
