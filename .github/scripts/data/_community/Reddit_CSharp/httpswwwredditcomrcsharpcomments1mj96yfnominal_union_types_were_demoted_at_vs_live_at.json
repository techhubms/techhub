Does anyone have a link with the timestamp?\n\nNot sure if it's being live streamed but I can provide these [images from the presentation.](https://imgur.com/a/igTEpuG)\n\nSo comes with dotnet 11?\n\nHe said they are waiting for people to free up. The new VS monthly releases are taking more people so most likely c#15 dotnet 11 unless the design falls flat\n\nI understand how needed union types are, but man, it will be a lot of LOCs for a fraction of what you can do with typescript.\n\nIt's still too bad they aren't going to pursue actual union types. We'll end up with another situation like `Nullable<T>` that will never, ever go away and always be a pain.",
