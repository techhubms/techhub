  "EnhancedContent": "Hi. Straight to the point: VS2022, multiple net 4.7.1 csprojs in sln. I need universal solution which will fail build when some formatting/styling rules will be voided. Nothing fancy - pascal/camel case rules, white spaces etc. It must be shared among all team members via git. Editorconfig basically does not work, parts of rules are in the VS settings, parts in editorconfig, and after trying to set it up (and reading huge amount of issues on gh) I gave up. What are you redditors using? Thanks.\n\nUse csharpier\n\nThere are a few decisions in csharpier that I don't agree with and I chose to not use it for my team. I love that after it runs the code is formatted completely but some of the decisions in how that formatting is done I find to be \"non-standard\".\n\n.editorconfig works fine for us. Sometimes you have to reload the solution for it to start working after you make changes to it, but once it's setup it works fine. I'm not trying to enforce strict formatting that goes against the norm either though, so maybe that's the issue. For anything more advanced I would look at Roslyn Analyzers.\n\nWe use the modern implementation of style cop, [https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers)\n\nWorks fine with config in the editorconfig, even though thatâ€™s not documented that well.\n\nI use StyleCop.Analyzers.Unstable in my more modern project. The fact that StyleCop.Analyzers hasn't been keeping up with modern language versions and you have to use a -beta package in your build is obnoxious and can set off other alarms.\n\nI use StyleCop.Analyzers.Unstable and SonarAnalyzer.CSharp by default in almost all projects, with a .ruleset file that I have tuned and (try to) ratchet up severity of various things over time.\n\nI used to use CodeMaid but there were a lot of stability problems there and I eventually uninstalled it. Being able to cleanup most problems just by saving was great, but not if it was crashing or inteferring with various refactorings.\n\nIf there are additional analyzers that other projects use, I would love to hear about them.",
