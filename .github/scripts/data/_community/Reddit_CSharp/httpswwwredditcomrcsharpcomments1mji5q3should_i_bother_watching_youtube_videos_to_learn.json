  "EnhancedContent": "I recently decided to learn C#,I've got past experience with Lua,JS,CSS,HTML ( we all start somewhere.. ) but I couldn't for the life of me find a clear answer to this question.I've been mainly considering the following:\n\n- a book is easier to navigate through\n\n- tutorials are quicker and kinda better since you have people explaining things to you\n\nIf you guys could give me an answer that'd be great!\n\nI've been a dev for nearly 30 years. Writing code, making mistakes and figuring them out has been 100% more reliable. You can get information buy videos, but honestly, the best devs I've worked have the 'trial by fire' learning method. In short repetition is key.\n\nIf you already know what questions to ask then you don't need a book. But if you don't, a good book will provide a structured overview of topics that you may even not know exist.\n\nVideos are good for quickly showing how to use tools. If you are not familiar with IDE and basic project management then I recommend starting with video tutorials.\n\nBut both of these things only provide information that allows you to learn faster. To really learn, you'll need to write code. As much as you can.\n\nYou will always get better information, and retain that information, from a properly written book. Personally, Id reccomend Programming C#12 by Ian Griffiths.\n\nThis book looks great thanks!\n\nMy advice whatever you do, start applying what you learn immediately.  Think of a project to apply the knowledge to.\n\nThe best kind of learning to me comes from pushing far enough into something where you start encountering problems or an understanding of why something might be necessary.  Then you come by that thing in your reading and it will be more quickly internalized because it actually means something to you and applies to your project.\n\nWhy not both? Books for theory, video for reinforcement and application\n\nDo you learn better by reading a book, or being guided in a tutorial?\n\nI'll be frank,I rarely read books,but I believe I'd have all the information gathered in one place and somewhat easily accessible\n\nIt's all subjective. If you learn better with a book, then do a book. There's all kinds of free materials out there, sample projects videos, etc.\n\nAre you trying to learn to build something specific?\n\nIf you just want to get to a level where you feel familiar with things watch a few YouTube videos and get coding (an AI assist can help dramatically in this part too)\n\nIf you want to get deep in trenched knowledge after this read books and keep coding",
