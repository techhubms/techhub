It's a source generator.\n\nRight now I'm actively working on a pet project a Kanban board with a backend built entirely in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core using Clean Architecture. The idea is to build something that can actually be extended: boards, cards, moving cards between columns, labels, comments, activity logs the usual stuff.\n\nFor now, the focus is on the backend. Iâ€™ve already got the basic CRUD operations in place and the architecture set up, and Iâ€™m gradually adding new features. Eventually, I want to hook it up to a simple UI (maybe Blazor or React), and add real-time updates with SignalR.\n\nThere's still a lot to build. I've just started working on it. If you're curious, the code is open source here:[https://github.com/NETViking-on/coreboard-kanban](https://github.com/NETViking-on/coreboard-kanban)\n\nI'm working on porting one of my python projects to c# on Linux. Using AOT, I can get 1/16th the execution time for the same code.\n\nI'm building a tiny app to help me combat a windows 11 issue I can't figure out. My machine seems to automatically adjust the input volume of my sound device. If I speak too loudly, it reduces it - but it never adjusts it back up. So over time it ends up at 10%.\n\nI am building a windows service (hosted service) that monitors the input volume of the default sound device and puts it back to 100% if it is less than 100%. It polls at a configurable interval.\n\nI am also building a winforms app that creates a tray icon with 2 buttons: \"Open\" and \"Exit\". Open shows a small window with log output from the background service, and exit shuts down both. It's been a fun little project.\n\nI built an app that uses nature sounds and focus features to help people focus, study, or relax ðŸ˜Œ used by over 60k people now.
