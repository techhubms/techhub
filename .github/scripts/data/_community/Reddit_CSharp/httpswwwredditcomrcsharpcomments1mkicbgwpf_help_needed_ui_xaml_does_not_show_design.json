Maybe I am wrong from top to bottom. Please help me. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI'm willing to bet most \"professionals\" barely use the design editor and write the xaml directly. I personally assign the DesignInstance Type to have the intellisense warn about wrong binding property names, but never bothered with mock data. If you remove IsDesignTimeCreatable, that's what you'll get. But since I was curious I just looked it up.\n\n[This article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/xaml-tools/xaml-designtime-data?view=vs-2022) seems to suggest writing values directly in the xaml to mock, using stuff like d:Text, d:Source, d:ListView.Items and so on.\n\nIt's the first time I've heard about IsDesignTimeCreatable. I can only find official references in these two articles as sentences. One for [uwp](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/data-binding/displaying-data-in-the-designer) and a [mvvm blog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2013/april/mvvm-maximizing-the-visual-designer%E2%80%99s-usage-with-design-time-data). But no official api description anywhere. Both articles mention requiring a parameterless constructor that feeds mock values to get it working.\n\nAnd it makes sense, because usually your service dependencies would be injected, and the designer can't know about DI configuration.\n\nThen I found this very relevant [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8472228/how-to-use-ddesigninstance-with-types-that-dont-have-default-constructor). The second answer has a solution using a static factory to create your instance passing null as parameters.\n\nWow. I am impressed with your digging skills and dedication for the answer. Thank you so much for your time. I took a look into the stackoverflow answer, and it contains a lot of good solutions to the problem. Thanks!\n\nIt is very useful. Thanks\n\nIf you have a constructor that injects dependencies, then the designer can't deal with it. That is expected as the designer isn't running your whole app.\n\nThe solution is to make a parameterless constructor. The #if DEBUG statement can be omitted. Either during runtime, you are calling the correct constructor, or if you use some DI all modern DI frameworks take care of this themselves. Usually it's something like \"I will call the constructor with the most parameters that I can resolve\".\n\nThanks!\n\nDo you inject 'd:DataContext=\"{d:DesignInstance Type=vm:CamerasViewModel, IsDesignTimeCreatable=True}\"' into &lt;UserControl&gt; Tag in xaml to see design preview?\n\nYou dont need to base the parameterless one on the one with parameters, just add this:\n\n`public CamerasViewModel(){}`",
