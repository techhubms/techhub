How was your experience with MAUI? I haven’t touched it but I’ve wanted to try it out for an exercise tracking app for my home gym\n\nthanks, I don't have much experience in it yet MAUI, so while I'm making this app I'll be studying in parallel. Considering that I learn very quickly and understand well, I don't think this will be a problem\n\nAmazing work!! Need more examples like this from the community to help push MAUI's credibility as a serious cross platform framework.\n\nthanks\n\nIt seems like this is just your UI mockup for the app idea, and not the actual implementation, right? Either way looks really nice\n\nyes, this is my layout, I indicated this in the description of the post. thanks !",
