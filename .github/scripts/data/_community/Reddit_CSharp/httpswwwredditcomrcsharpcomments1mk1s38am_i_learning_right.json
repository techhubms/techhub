  "EnhancedContent": "Hi mate !\n\nI've been a solo developer on a completely unknown language for 10 years\n\nThen I've come to the realization that if I wanted to evolve in my career (I work in IT but not as a developer) I needed to learn .NET and C#.\n\nSo, two years ago, I bought a 20$ c# basic learning course on Udemy (IDK if it's known worldwide but it's a learning platform with video courses) to learn the basics of .net\n\nThen, I started to port my old projects to C#, starting by doing simple console stuff, to winform applications, then basic asp.net, APIs, and now I'm working on Blazor websites over those 2 years.\n\nJust like you, I used AI to help me doing stuff and learning the best approach to do things I wanted.\n\nBUT.\n\nIMO, the most important thing to do, as a beginner, is to use AI to LEARN, not to DO the code for you.\n\nI know it's hard to not fall for it, but you should ask \"how should I do this ?\" \"What's the best approach to do what I want to achieve ?\" \"Here is my code, is it good ?\" \"Show me where I was wrong\" Instead of asking \"I want to do this, show me the code\"\n\nWhen AI gives you code, read it, understand it, and if you don't, ask it to explain it to you. Try to limit copy/paste to write code yourself\n\nKeep basic Intellisense, do not use \"GitHub copilot\" enhanced Intellisense as it tends to suggest complete methods\n\nSorry if my English is a bit broken, I'm not a native English speaker ^\n\nHave fun learning & coding !\n\nAI is **after** you know shit.\n\nThis is a terrible suggestion.\n\nHow does he know if it tells him something incorrect? How will he know if it suggests something that will make his app insecure and flawed? Does it explain in depth what OOP is? What about why you use Inheritance, or even suggest what inheritance is?\n\nIt does not. You have to know these things before hand, just so you can even ask it to explain the concepts you have heard about.\n\nThank youðŸ¤”ðŸ’­",
