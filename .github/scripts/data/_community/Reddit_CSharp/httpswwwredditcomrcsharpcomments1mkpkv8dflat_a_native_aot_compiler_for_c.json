  "FeedLevelAuthor": "C#",
  "EnhancedContent": "I liked the idea of having portable compilers such as in C/C++, Go etc where you can compile source files directly without projects or solutions like in [bflat](https://github.com/bflattened/bflat). So I built a wrapper to call different c# compilers and then the linker to build native executables on windows and linux and native dlls on windows. Hope you guys find it useful.\n\nGithub: [dflat](https://github.com/TheAjaykrishnanR/dflat)",
