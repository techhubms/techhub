  "EnhancedContent": "I have 18 years exp .net development, former manager and tech lead roles, now consulting for a multi national company that has been changing CTOs every 2 years. We are calling the current number 5. I've been on and off this company for more than 7 years.\n\nNumber 5 took over more than an year ago, by the books, and, just now, he is trying to implement his great vision which is, of course, cost cutting everywhere.\n\nSince then, he won't listen to any influential people, who are gradually resigning, do not understand technology and he is always chatgpting that in 5 years AI agents will take over all IT departments.\n\nWhat are your opinions about it?
