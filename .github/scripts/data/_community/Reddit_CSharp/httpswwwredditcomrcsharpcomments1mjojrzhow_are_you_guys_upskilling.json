It a vicious circle. Are Udemy courses the real deal or how to practice handson?\n\nThe C# Player's Guide is your way to go to solidify your basic concepts and up-skill\n\nAlso if you buy now you get the next version free (sometime towards the end of the year hopefully)\n\nand for core concepts the current version is more than fine.\n\n[https://csharpplayersguide.com/blog/2025/03/14/another-6th-edition-update/](https://csharpplayersguide.com/blog/2025/03/14/another-6th-edition-update/)\n\n> > >\n> As a reminder, I’ve committed to the idea that anybody who paid money for the fifth edition (on Gumroad or Amazon) will get the sixth edition for free once it becomes available (on Gumroad as a PDF, because I can’t afford to ship printed copies to everyone for obvious reasons). So if you’re debating whether you should wait, don’t. Just get the fifth edition now. When the sixth edition is ready, you’ll be able to get that for free.\n> > > >\n\nSide projects\n\nI am studying [how async await really works](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/how-async-await-really-works/) for like a month. It's a very good post but full of advanced c# concepts that are required to fully understand it. It's incredible how can AI help you understand any excerpt you got stuck.\n\nAfter that I'm back to recording videos of .net 8 API using DDD, authorization and tests to YouTube. They got like 1 or 2 views but it's incredible how you learn much more when you are teaching, even if it is for yourself.\n\nThis is my best advice for you. Instead of watching Udemy courses, try to make one on YouTube of any topic you want\n\nAbsolutely this. If you can understand something well enough to teach it, you understand it more than if you learned it for yourself.\n\nCare to share some of your videos? Maybe we can bring that up to 3 views!\n\nMore than half way through Functional Programming in C# by Enrico Buonanno.\n\nSide projects, I keep making side projects to learn new stuff.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I used Pluralsight a lot. But as it grew, it lost its appeal to me. It rarely puts out a course I'm interested in and even if it does, they are hard to find amongst all the rubbish. Now, back to books, with a flutter of Youtube. Sometimes I'll jump on Github and learn some tricks in other people's code.\n\nI bought the Framework Design Guide. TBH first principles will always be the go-to for me when I need to upskill. Also, I do side-projects, like I've been playing around with recreating Star Wars Rebellion videogame from 1999 to be a vanilla C# game, (no unity), to learn how to use RavenDB and event driven architecture and .net Aspire",
