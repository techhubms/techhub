I've definitely asked AI its advice on architectural decisions and things like that but never for code generation.\n\nCongrats on this work. If it is really not AI generated it looks impressive for a beginning developer.\n\nKinda refreshing to see something allegedly not vibe-coded. Keep up your work!\n\nCheck the commit log, no AI. Thanks for the kind words :)",
