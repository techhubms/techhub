  "EnhancedContent": "We have officially entered the trough of disillusionment.\n\nAfter using GPT5 for the past hour or so, it is clear that AI has officially entered the trough of disillusionment. It has for me at least.  How about you?\n\n[The Hype Cycle](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*DzQp-DLAxyIqWjY5.jpg)\n\nI still find AI very valuable, but the limitations holding it back have not been moved forward in a meaningful way and likely will not for a while as it is clear we have reached the end of scaling and model size benefits.\n\n## Welcome to the [r/ArtificialIntelligence](/r/ArtificialIntelligence/) gateway\n\n### Question Discussion Guidelines\n\nPlease use the following guidelines in current and future posts:\n\n- Post must be greater than 100 characters - the more detail, the better.\n- Your question might already have been answered. Use the search feature if no one is engaging in your post.\n\n- AI is going to take our jobs - its been asked a lot!\n- Discussion regarding positives and negatives about AI are allowed and encouraged. Just be respectful.\n- Please provide links to back up your arguments.\n- No stupid questions, unless its about AI being the beast who brings the end-times. It's not.\n\n###### Thanks - please let mods know if you have any questions / comments / etc\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/ArtificialInteligence) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nIf not a trough, then a plateau. Just as deadly with the amounts of capital thrown into this hype-cinerator.\n\nYann Lecunn was RIGHT and Hype bros were all laughing at him now look who is foolish.\n\nI hope he is having an amazing day\n\nWell on the bright side society isn't going to collapse in the near term now.\n\nWell....remember the dotcom bubble?\n\nIt's gonna get ugly.\n\nnot at all. It's not about you, it's about the 'industry in general'. You are an early adopter. the real trough of disillusionment comes when a lot of companies don't see the expected results from their investments and actions in regards to AI. That will still take a while.\n\nWhat's the issue? I've never understood the obsession with AGI\n\nJust use the focken tools, they are nice. If AI companies won't be able to sustain themselves, they will close the free services and increase prices for the API. Not a big deal, in 2021 GPT-3 costed $60 per 1m output tokens, we are too spoiled. You can also be happy it won't take your job but increase your productivity (if you're a senior dev, for example)\n\nPlus, the OSS models won't go away\n\nSo, the normal tech cycle: hype, realization of limitations, \"just a useful tech\"\n\nNew models are out for 2 hours and people already spreading doom and gloom.\n\nLimitations of current LLM paradigm indeed. For any further breakthroughs, it requires a completely new architecture to manage it efficiently.\n\nLLMs also perform poorly as context gets larger and are not cost efficient to replace similar roles compared to let’s say a human from low income countries.\n\nYou do realise there are other models / companies right? Most people believe google will achieve AGI first, so ur post to me is a bit idk, too early",
