  "EnhancedContent": "I keep seeing posts asking for the best AI courses, roadmaps, videos, or learning paths — but it always leaves me wondering: what does it actually mean to “get into AI”?\n\nPersonally, I’ve built RAG systems using just Python and the LangChain library. I’ve also created chatbots around LLMs with simple API calls. So far, I haven’t needed complex math or deep ML theory to do that. So I find myself asking — is that already “AI”? Or am I just a builder using AI tools?\n\nThen there’s the job title confusion. What exactly is the difference between an AI Engineer and an ML Engineer? I can’t imagine companies hiring people to build entire LLMs from scratch — that would require insane amounts of compute, time, and money. So what do these AI roles actually do in a company day-to-day?\n\nIs it mostly fine-tuning existing models? Prompt engineering? Wrapping APIs? Building pipelines?\n\nI’d really like to understand what “getting into AI” means in practice — especially in a company or enterprise setting. Because right now, I feel like I’m doing AI work, but according to many online “learning paths,” I haven’t even started.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from people already working in this space.\n\n## Welcome to the [r/ArtificialIntelligence](/r/ArtificialIntelligence/) gateway\n\n### Question Discussion Guidelines\n\nPlease use the following guidelines in current and future posts:\n\n- Post must be greater than 100 characters - the more detail, the better.\n- Your question might already have been answered. Use the search feature if no one is engaging in your post.\n\n- AI is going to take our jobs - its been asked a lot!\n- Discussion regarding positives and negatives about AI are allowed and encouraged. Just be respectful.\n- Please provide links to back up your arguments.\n- No stupid questions, unless its about AI being the beast who brings the end-times. It's not.\n\n###### Thanks - please let mods know if you have any questions / comments / etc\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/ArtificialInteligence) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\n# Maybe the real AI is the friends we made along the way!\n\nIntegration is the next emerging field. You are at the cutting edge of technology. We live in a time where tools are leaving labs and are no longer limited to math phds. Field of integrating ai is growing, much needed and you’re on the right path.\n\nthank you friend! Yeah I always get over stimulated and whelmed with this amount of information out there and get stuck w what to do!",
