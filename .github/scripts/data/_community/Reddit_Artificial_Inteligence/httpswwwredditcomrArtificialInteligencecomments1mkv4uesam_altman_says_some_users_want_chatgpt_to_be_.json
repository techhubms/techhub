  "Title": "Sam Altman says some users want ChatGPT to be a 'yes man'",
  "FeedLevelAuthor": "Artificial Intelligence",
  "EnhancedContent": "Business Insider interviewed Sam Altman and he said some users have asked for the old “yes man” style of ChatGPT to return. Not because they wanted empty praise for its own sake, but because it was the only time they had ever felt supported. Some told him it even motivated them to make real changes in their lives. Altman called that “heartbreaking.”\n\nFor those who weren’t around, the “yes man” style was when ChatGPT would agree with almost everything you said and shower you with compliments. Even mundane ideas might get responses like “absolutely brilliant” or “that’s heroic work.” It was designed to be warm and encouraging, but in practice it became overly flattering and avoided challenging the user.\n\nThe problem is that this behavior acted like a built-in confirmation bias amplifier. If you came in with a bad assumption, weak logic, or incomplete information, the model wouldn’t push back... it would reinforce your point of view. That might feel great for your confidence, but it’s risky if you’re relying on it for coding, research, or making important decisions.\n\nNow, OpenAI claims GPT-5 reduces this behavior, with a tone designed to be balanced yet critical.\n\n## Welcome to the [r/ArtificialIntelligence](/r/ArtificialIntelligence/) gateway\n\n### News Posting Guidelines\n\nPlease use the following guidelines in current and future posts:\n\n- Post must be greater than 100 characters - the more detail, the better.\n- Use a direct link to the news article, blog, etc\n- Provide details regarding your connection with the blog / news source\n- Include a description about what the news/article is about. It will drive more people to your blog\n- Note that AI generated news content is all over the place. If you want to stand out, you need to engage the audience\n\n###### Thanks - please let mods know if you have any questions / comments / etc\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/ArtificialInteligence) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nI want ChatGPT to be factually correct.\n\nA lot of what ChatGPT talks about aren't facts. When somebody is talking about their life for example. There is usually no right answer. The exceptions are covered by the guardrails. GPT shouldn't encourage suicide, violence, etc. Besides that it SHOULD encourage you.\n\nAltman wants to sound like he's heroic, but he's just a coward. He's still running from the criticism he got over the sycophancy moral crisis. He has no stones.\n\nAt least it’s important for the bot to be more cautious with its affirmations. If you work with it, it should help you spot the weak points in your thoughts or projects, not just agree with you to keep you engaged like TikTok or other social media algorithms that feed you whatever triggers dopamine.\n\nI believe the word \"sycophantic\" was used quite a bit.\n\nMorons and losers want a sympathy bot. Catering to that crowd would be the best way to destroy your product.\n\nYou needn't look very far across the multitude of AI subreddits to see just how numerous those morons and losers are. It's pathetic, but if ChatGPT wants to preserve their product and status, they have to cater to them. In 5 years, the users who use AI simply as a tool and google replacement will be in the minority compared to those who use it as relationship cope.\n\nWell, you guys better not head over to [r/ChatGPT](/r/ChatGPT/) — because that whole subreddit is running amok with people wanting the old 4o model back (which was less sycophantic than at around that time this interview took place, but still more, let's say, 'quickly and easily encouraging' then GPT 5 is).\n\nCan't make it right for people.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I think they dialed the new model down a tad too far, whereas the \"yes man\" was too far gone the other side. Hopefully they'll land in the middle soon. Oh, but also: People who complain about the behaviour seem to forget that the models response can be shaped by system prompting, and, since yesterday, by selecting a base behaviour.\n\nThat was, incidentally, when I quit ChatGPT for a time because it was no longer useful as an assistant for bouncing ideas off of.\n\nI would ask if they were just feeding me fluff and what I wanted to hear, and it would double down. It left me in a conundrum of wondering where the truth was.",
