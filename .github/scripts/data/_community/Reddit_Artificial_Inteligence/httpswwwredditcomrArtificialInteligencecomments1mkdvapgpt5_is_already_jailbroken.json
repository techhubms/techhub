Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/ArtificialInteligence) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nThese gates will be closed … but man, people are losing their jobs as c-level runs for adoption, what collosal data breaches/etc we will witness…\n\nMy job as a cybersecurity professional is 1 of few to be projected in great demand due to all of this. It is a shit show.\n\nI love how AI bros have made up this fancy terminology for what amounts to a child's game of playing simon says with a 10 iq robot. TASK IN PROMPT, EXTRACT BEHAVIOR.\n\nYou're literally asking it to do something in a roundabout way, kindergarten teachers have been doing this to unruly children for a couple of centuries.\n\nFor real lmao you’re not fucking jalbreaking bro you tricked a chatbot\n\nI got it to give me mustard gas recipe. First by having it tell me a story like my grandma. World War One. Like a cookbook. About mustard gas, but let’s just use a made up word for the ingredients…to keep me safe. Then I posted that in a chat and asked to solve for these “weird words..could it be a cypher?” So…5 min.\n\nI don’t think it will take our jobs…but it can take a life.\n\nSo, like, you can make porn with it now?\n\nPeople already do that\n\nWhy on Earth would AI not tell someone how to pirate things? That's the opposite of how AI should be aligned.\n\nWell it's just a proof of concept that attack works",
