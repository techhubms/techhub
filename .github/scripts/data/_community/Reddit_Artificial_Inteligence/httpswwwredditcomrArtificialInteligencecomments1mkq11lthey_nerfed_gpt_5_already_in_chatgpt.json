  "EnhancedContent": "So right after it launched when you wrote to gpt-5-main: \"think harder...\", it would reason for 2-4 minutes and have and have around 50 reasoning steps depending on the task. Right now if you do the same it will reason for around 1 minute and have 15-20 reasoning steps. They are already nerfing it to save costs. So the router doesn't route to \"gpt-5-thinking-high\" anymore but only \"gpt-5-thinking-low\". They are saving costs already and lying about the router being broken.\n\n## Welcome to the [r/ArtificialIntelligence](/r/ArtificialIntelligence/) gateway\n\n### Question Discussion Guidelines\n\nPlease use the following guidelines in current and future posts:\n\n- Post must be greater than 100 characters - the more detail, the better.\n- Your question might already have been answered. Use the search feature if no one is engaging in your post.\n\n- AI is going to take our jobs - its been asked a lot!\n- Discussion regarding positives and negatives about AI are allowed and encouraged. Just be respectful.\n- Please provide links to back up your arguments.\n- No stupid questions, unless its about AI being the beast who brings the end-times. It's not.\n\n###### Thanks - please let mods know if you have any questions / comments / etc\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Altmann is an excellent seller of dreams and carpets that are expensive and easily degrade over time. Once you've managed to woo an audience and get all the suckers to pay, you scale back and raise the prices shortly after revealing another chapter of wonderful things to come... wake up people!\n\nAnthropic seems like a much better company, it is governed by a group of people all interestingly from open ai. Also, let’s face it, ChatGPT is such a dull name\n\nIt's crazy that the best way to become a household name and dominant a market is through massive debt and operate at a loss until you've cornered the market. They all do it now\n\nWhy do you think they are lying? Like I could understand this mindset a few months, but perhaps this isn't anything nefarious and actually just a poor roll out. This is the same company that can't get the graphs right for one of the biggest launches.\n\nSeems extreme to call them liars already. Does it not seem more likely that their servers are just overwhelmed on a new product launch? Hanlon's razer and all...\n\nCloseAi costs in the new moto\n\nMaybe use it for more than 20 minutes before leaping to generalizations like this?\n\nWhy don’t I have it yet? I’m a plus user.",
