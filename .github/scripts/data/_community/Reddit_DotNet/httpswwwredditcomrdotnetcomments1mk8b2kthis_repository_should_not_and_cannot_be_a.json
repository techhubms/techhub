I'm not programming in .NET Framework anymore, so I haven't used referencesource for years. Was it providing any value that source.dot.net doesn't?\n\nYes, referencesource is .NET framework and source.dot.net is .NET\n\n- Microsoft rarely made announcements when deprecating tiny little things like this and IMHO they don’t have an internal process on non-core assets like this. Remind you that such supporting tools/sites are provided without SLA. So, your ask about why might not be answered (or at least not immediately). People asked about Mono’s fate and that took several years to be made public.\n- In the end, maintaining such sites have clear costs, but the audience and return is limited. As long as they continue to support debugging into source code with VS and this GitHub repo, I am fine.\n\n> > >\n> In the end, maintaining such sites have clear costs, but the audience and return is limited.\n> > > >\n\nBut if the audience is limited, so are the costs.\n\ncosts?????\n\nIf you can drop support for .net framework/just back port bugfixes to the latest version supporting .net framework. MQTTnet also dropped .net framework support with version 5. You don't get support for entity framework core or asp net core for even longer.\n\nis this actually surprising to people years after announcing the deprecation of .NET framework?\n\nIt's not deprecated. At all.\n\n[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework)\n\n\".NET Framework 4.8.1 is the latest version of .NET Framework and will continue to be distributed with future releases of Windows. As long as it is installed on a supported version of Windows, .NET Framework 4.8.1 will continue to also be supported.\"\n\nThanks for your post tinmanjk.
