Jetbrains tools anywhere really.\n\nMacOS, Rider\n\nAt home, I tend to use Linux and either VS Code and the dotnet CLI or Rider. At work, Windows 11 and VS 2022.\n\nNeovim♥️\n\nmacOS, Rider. A bit of Cursor when needed\n\nWhy? Cause it just works. The front end to my .NET stuff is a native iOS and native Android app, so easier to be on one platform\n\nI also edit video and photos - which macOS is just nicer\n\nVS and VS Code on Windows.\n\nVS Code on Mac.\n\nRider on all OSes\n\nWork : Linux(cachyos) Rider(c#) and VS-code(web/ts) Home : Linux(nixos) then the same tools.\n\nBefore when we had really old code we needed to maintain I was forced to use windows and visual studio, now when that's gone I'm really happy to get the performance and productivity from Rider.\n\nLinux is a welcome bonus, especially the way windows is moving.",
