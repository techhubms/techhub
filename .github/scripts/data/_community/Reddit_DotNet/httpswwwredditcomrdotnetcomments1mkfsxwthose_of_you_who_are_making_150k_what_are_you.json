  "EnhancedContent": "I spend most days telling people above me to not make stupid decisions. It isn't going well.\n\nThis is the most accurate summary I have ever seen\n\nAnd let me guess, they make 300k a year taking any decisions just to show they are \"working\"\n\nI spend most days telling people to check with you before making decisions. And to stop adding more and more work without adding resources.\n\n- working with ops to segment a bunch of azure stuff into new vnets for security purposes without breaking production apps\n- Building out a new ETL process for data consumption and architecture for service processing of said data\n- React App Redesign\n- Migration from Micro Git Repos to Mono Repo....\n- Killing and cleaning up 10 years of nuget artifact hell in the local nuget repo (mono repo resolves this)\n- Upgrading everything not on .Net 9 to .Net 9 through the WHOLE ecosystem\n- Migrating away from 100+ SSIS packages to Azure Data Factory, logic apps, and azure functions, and snowflake..\n- Constant Pull Request reviews\n- Constant meetings\n- Constant groomings\n- cherry picking code for releases\n- managing and executing releases\n- managing the git branch strategy\n- documenting dev onboarding processes/env setup/branching strategy\n- sitting on Arch calls talking about Arch things with other Arch's\n- somehow finding 20 hours in a week that don't exist to work on code that had a deadline last week.\n\n> > >\n> Constant Pull Request reviews\n> > > >\n\nThese and meetings are day killers\n\nI think framing is important here, 150k is a juniors salary in New York (at least for my company) and a senior’s salary outside of the US\n\nOr elsewhere in the US\n\nMaintenance on institutional software. Senior level.\n\nJob title? Professional puck passer as institution software is ass.\n\nInternal user “Why does this error out uploading a file”\n\nMe “Because our vendors software was built in the before times when cavemen roamed”\n\nOther daily things include upkeep on our c# backend for database and other things. Managing people etc.\n\nEnterprise Architect / Development Manager / DevOps / \"Wouldn't be cool if..?\" dream destroyer",
