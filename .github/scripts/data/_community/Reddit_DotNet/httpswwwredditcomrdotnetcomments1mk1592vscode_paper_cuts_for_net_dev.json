I manage multiple large solutions, where I use the UI in VS for Nuget to update and manage package versions across the entire solution. Working with Nuget now in VSCode is really hard and very manual. I would love a fully-fledged UI in VSCode like we have in VS for Nuget.

Thanks for the recommendation.\n\nthis üëçüèº love the extension!\n\nFirst of all, if it is still not, it should be free of subscription like any popular language extensions\n\nThis is one of the main problems. I have no problem paying for developer tooling, but it really hurts the ecosystem, trust, and adoption.\n\nAnother really bad move was disabling extensions in all VSCode forks. This means that people who use Cursor for example, can not use the extension, and are forced to use community-maintained ones such as DotRush (which is pretty good TBH).\n\n[https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp](https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp)\n\nYour feedback should go to the right place, whether there are Microsoft employees monitoring this (there are indeed).\n\nTo be honest here.. Never saw a point\n\nBloat VSCode (text editor) to oblivion just so it can work like regular IDE\n\nNo hate, just my tough\n\nEven a bloated VS Code runs smoother than VS /shrug\n\nBut personally I just absolutely hate how VS forces you to use its dumb UI and integrated management tools for stuff‚Ä¶.i spend more time angry at the tool having unexpected behavior than doing any work.\n\nFrick that. Just give me the text editor and command line again\n\nI prefer manual nuget management. I switched originally away from VS years ago cause it kept bugging out or doing weird stuff\n\nIf I‚Äôm having trouble reading the dotnet build output, I output to a log file and open it in vscode.\n\nI‚Äôve been using VS Code for almost 7 years now exclusively; I don‚Äôt really get why I would ever need to open VS or what value it brings\n\nThanks for your post Sure-Natural-9086.
