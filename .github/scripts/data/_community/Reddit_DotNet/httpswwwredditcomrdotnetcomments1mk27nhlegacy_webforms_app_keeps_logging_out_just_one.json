  "EnhancedContent": "Note this is a web forms application and we haven't pushed any code changes recently. I have exactly one user who has been using this for over a decade but all of a sudden will logging and just get logged out clicking around the site.\n\nIt is only one user and I can login with the just fine (I had them give me their creds) and it works for me. He has verified it happens on both chrome and firefox for him.\n\nI am at the point where I need him to verify it does it on another machine because this is the typical, works on my machine(s) scenario. However, I still would like to try and figure out what is going on, on his machine but am really at a stopping point of where I can begin to try and diagnose that, since it has done it across multiple browsers (same machine though).\n\nThe ONLY thing I could think of was if one of the two cookies asp.net uses are getting deleted somehow, but I don't see how multiple browsers, even on the same machine, would have that issue, so I'm really just looking for any educated guesses or help here.\n\nI'll note the auth is the old asp.net membership stuff that came with web forms\n\nAsk him to make sure the time zone is correct on his computer, not just that the time “looks right”\n\nI had an issue like that and then realized his emails were coming from the future\n\nOh man this is I great idea. We've had issues with MFA with that before on my apps that aren't 25 years old lol\n\nSo you have a login screen and the user tries to login with credentials.\n\nWhat is happening after that? It is redirected to some page and then logging out or it is not logging in at all?\n\nYea just a plain jane old school username and password login running on the aspnet membership provider from the early 2000s.\n\nFrom their explanation, they click around the site to just do normal stuff and then get logged out. Think like if you let your session timeout, but we have a long timeout set for that, and also it is not happening to anyone else in the system, which is probably about 50 users. And they say this happens what seems like random, no specific page or button clicked and also sometimes it happens and simetimes it doesn't. It just seems to be getting more frequent for this one user\n\nThanks for your post andrewsmd87. Please note that we don't allow spam, and we ask that you follow the rules available in the sidebar.
