It’s designed for real-world practicality by emphasizing design documentation before code, multiple peer reviews, visual workflow boards, shared ownership, and customer validation.\n\nEvery work item is scoped to less than two weeks and begins with a concise design document. Peer signoff is required before coding starts, helping eliminate architectural surprises during PR reviews. These documents not only provide immediate context but also serve as a lasting knowledge base for the team and a valuable resource for AI coding agents and LLMs.\n\nThere’s no assigned ownership of workstreams. Engineers are encouraged to pick up any ticket that interests them, supported by team conversations and the design doc knowledge base. Successes and learning opportunities are shared by all.\n\nGolazo is built for asynchronous collaboration, making it ideal for both in-person teams and hybrid teams across time zones. Daily standups focus on lessons learned and moving work forward, not just status updates. Regular retrospectives celebrate wins and identify ways to improve efficiency. Planning is a group activity, ensuring everyone’s perspective is included.\n\nCurious about the details?
