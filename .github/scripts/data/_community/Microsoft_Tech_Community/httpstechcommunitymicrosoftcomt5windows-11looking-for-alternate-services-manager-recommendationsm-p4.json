  "EnhancedContent": "Hi all,\n\nNot sure if this exists, but I'm on the hunt for a (preferably FOSS) program that can serve as a tool to help manage running and disabled services. I have lots of programs for various things on my work laptop (pro AV engineer here) and everything likes to install services whether they are update managers or background processes. It would be great if such tool had info on built-in or common services short of Googling them all. Black Viper had a ton of info back in the day. A feature I'd really like to see is the ability to store/recall/import/export presets for groups of services to enable or disable based on what I might be doing.\n\nThis might be more granular than anyone should bother being but I definitely don't like bloat so it's worth a shot.",
