  "Description": "# Unlock the Latest Agentic App Capabilities—Now Available with Ignite 2025\n\nThe Ignite 2025 update delivers a major leap forward for the AI Toolkit extension pack in VS Code, introducing a unified, end-to-end environment for building, visualizing, and deploying intelligent agentic applications. This release enables developers to build and debug locally in VS Code, then deploy to the cloud with a single click. Seamlessly switch between VS Code and the Foundry portal for visualization, orchestration, and evaluation, creating a smooth roundtrip workflow that accelerates innovation and delivers a truly unified AI development experience. Download the AI Toolkit extension today and start building next-generation agentic apps in VS Code!\n\n![]()\n\n# What Can You Do with the AI Toolkit Extension Pack?\n\n## Build AI Agents Using GitHub Copilot\n\n- Scaffold agent applications using best-practice patterns, tool-calling examples, tracing hooks, and test scaffolds, all powered by Copilot and aligned with the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview).\n- Generate agent code in Python or .NET, giving you flexibility to target your preferred runtime.\n\n## Build and Customize YAML Workflows\n\n- Design YAML-based workflows in the Foundry portal, then continue editing and testing directly in VS Code.\n- To customize your YAML-based workflows, instantly convert it to Agent Framework code using GitHub Copilot. Upgrade from declarative design to code-first customization without starting from scratch.\n\n![]()\n\n## Visualize Multi-Agent Workflows\n\n- Envision your code-based agent workflows with an interactive graph visualizer that reveals each component and how they connect\n- Watch in real-time how each node lights up as you run your agent. Use the visualizer to understand and debug complex agent graphs, making iteration fast and intuitive.\n\n## Experiment, Debug, and Evaluate Locally\n\n- Use the Hosted Agents Playground to quickly interact with your agents on your development machine.\n- Leverage local tracing support to debug reasoning steps, tool calls, and latency hotspots—so you can quickly diagnose and fix issues.\n- Define metrics, tasks, and datasets for agent evaluation, then implement metrics using the Foundry Evaluation SDK and orchestrate evaluations runs with the help of Copilot.\n\n![]()\n\n## Seamless Integration Across Environments\n\n- Jump from Foundry Portal to VS Code Web for a development environment in your preferred code editor setting.\n- Open YAML workflows, playgrounds, and agent templates directly in VS Code for editing and deployment.\n\n![]()\n\n# How to Get Started\n\n- **Install the AI Toolkit extension pack** from the VS Code marketplace.\n- **Install the Azure MCP server extension** to leverage GitHub Copilot to interact with your Foundry resources\n- **Select the AI Toolkit icon** on the VS Code sidebar to view and build with your LLMs and agents.\n- **Select the Foundry extension** icon for deeper integration and access to enterprise-grade hosting and evaluation.\n- **Install the** [Foundry SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/sdk-overview?pivots=programming-language-python) and review documentation for both AITK and Foundry.\n\n# Feedback & Support\n\nTry out the extensions and let us know what you think!
