Service Groups are tenant level resources so they can have members across the tenant but do not interfere or use tenant-wide RBAC or Policy abilities.\n\n![]()\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Low Privilege Management:** Service Groups are designed to operate with minimal permissions, ensuring that users can manage resources without needing excessive access and appealing to multiple personas. Access to a Service Group does not grant role-based access control or policy inheritance to its members.\n- **Flexible and Varying Hierarchies:** Azure resources and scopes, from anywhere in the tenant, can become members of one or multiple service groups. Additionally, Service Groups can be nested providing the ability to have multiple hierarchy structures, i.e. Cost Center, Product, Organization, and more!\n- **Monitoring Capabilities:** From your application to infrastructure health, Azure Monitor features (such as [Health Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/health-models/overview)) are now available to help you troubleshoot, investigate, and monitor your Service Group.\n\n## When should I use them?\n\nService Groups should be leveraged in scenarios where resources sprawl across existing containers making it difficult to monitor and manage them. This is commonly found in scenarios needing to model application hierarchy, company services and workloads. Service Groups cannot be used as a deployment scope nor to manage Policy nor RBAC.\n\n## Try it out!\n\nQuickly start with Service Groups [using REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/create-service-group-rest-api)https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/service-groups/create-service-group-rest-api or [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/ServiceGroupsBrowse.ReactView)!\n\nFor more information on Service Groups, please visit [aka.ms/servicegroups](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/overview).\n\n### FAQ\n\n*Do Service Groups replace existing Azure groups?*\n\nNo, Service Groups have been designed to work in parallel with existing Azure Groups. For a comparison of existing scopes, please review the [scenario comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/overview#scenario-comparison) documentation.\n\n*Who can create Service Groups?*\n\nAnyone with a valid Azure user account in a Microsoft Entra directory can leverage Service Groups!\n\n*Why are Service Groups tenant level?*\n\nService Groups are tenant level so they can have membership from across the tenant.
