If you’re an Azure VMware Solution (AVS) customer, here’s what you need to know about the new requirements and how they will affect your cloud deployments.\n\n###### **What’s changing?**\n\nBroadcom is changing its VMware licensing policies across all hyperscaler platforms to require customers to “**bring your own” portable subscription** for **VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF)**. This means customers must purchase portable VCF subscriptions directly from Broadcom to use with cloud services in the future, including Azure VMware Solution.\n\n###### **AVS already supports “bring your own” licensing model**\n\nThe good news is that Azure VMware Solution is ready for this change. The **AVS VCF BYO** **L** option is available in all **35 AVS regions worldwide**, allowing customers to run AVS using their own VCF subscriptions. This BYOL solution is priced lower than AVS with bundled VCF subscription.\n\n###### **No product changes to AVS**\n\n**These updates are about licensing only**—there are no product changes to how Azure VMware Solution works. Microsoft will continue to deliver AVS as a fully managed VCF private cloud service on Azure. In practice, this means that Microsoft takes care of all infrastructure and VMware host level software management, patches and upgrades. You don’t need to worry about hardware maintenance or manual VMware host updates.\n\n###### **Key dates and transition details**\n\n- Microsoft will stop selling AVS with VCF subscriptions included after October 15, 2025. After this date, new AVS node purchases will require you to provide a VCF subscription purchased from Broadcom.\n- Microsoft will honor existing Reserved Instance commitments to AVS customers. If you purchase AVS Reserved Instances (RIs) on or before October 15, 2025, you can continue to use your AVS nodes without any licensing or product changes until your RI term ends.\n- AVS with license included PayGo nodes can continue to operate **without any licensing or product changes** through October 31, 2026. Alternatively, customers can switch from AVS PayGo and purchase an AVS RI with license included by October 15, 2025.\n\n###### **Helpful resources**\n\nWe’re committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for our customers and partners.
