  "Description": "One of the most common questions Azure customers and administrators ask is:\n\n> >\n> *“How do I know who created this resource?”*\n> >\n\nIf you’ve ever been in charge of managing a large subscription with dozens (or even thousands) of resources, you know how important it is to answer this question quickly. Whether it’s for troubleshooting, governance, or compliance, tracking the origin of a resource can save time and reduce confusion.\n\nThe good news: Azure makes this information available. You just need to know where to look.\n\n### Step 1: Open the Resource Overview\n\nNavigate to the **Overview** page of the resource in question. This gives you the usual metadata like **resource group**, **subscription**, **location**, **login server**, and **provisioning state**.\n\nAt first glance, however, you won’t see *who* created the resource. That information isn’t shown in the overview fields.\n\n### Step 2: Switch to JSON View\n\nOn the Overview page, look for the link labeled **“JSON View”** in the top right corner.\n\nClicking this opens the full resource definition in JSON format.\n\n### Step 3: Scroll to the systemData Section\n\nWithin the JSON, scroll until you find the **systemData** object. This is where Azure tracks metadata about the resource lifecycle.\n\nHere’s what you’ll find:\n\n- \"systemData\": {\n\"createdBy\": \"someuser@domain.com\", \"createdByType\": \"User\", \"createdAt\": \"2025–05–20T19:50:33.1511397Z\", \"lastModifiedBy\": \"someuser@domain.com\", \"lastModifiedByType\": \"User\", \"lastModifiedAt\": \"2025–05–20T19:50:33.1511397Z\" }\n\n### What This Tells You\n\n- **createdBy** → The user or service principal that created the resource.\n- **createdByType** → Whether it was created by a human user, managed identity, or another Azure service.\n- **createdAt** → The exact timestamp of creation (UTC).\n- **lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedByType,** and **lastModifiedAt** → Useful if the resource was updated after creation.\n\nThis metadata gives you clear visibility into **who provisioned the resource and when**.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n- **Governance** — Understand ownership and responsibility.\n- **Troubleshooting** — Track down configuration changes.\n- **Compliance & Auditing** — Satisfy requirements for accountability in your cloud environment.\n\nBy making the **systemData** object part of your standard investigation checklist, you’ll save yourself the guesswork the next time you’re wondering, *“Who created this resource?”*",
