  "Description": "*Authored by Misha Bansal, Product Manager, Azure Compute*\n\nWe are excited to announce the public preview of the new Azure Ebsv6 and Ebdsv6 Virtual Machines, powered by 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8573C (Emerald Rapids) processors. These VMs deliver significantly higher remote storage performance, scaling up to 800,000 IOPS and 14 Gbps of remote disk throughput featured by [Azure Boost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-boost/overview) which is designed to accelerate storage and networking capabilities.\n\nThe Ebsv6 VMs are purpose-built for memory-intensive workloads, including relational database servers, large-scale data warehousing, and advanced analytics. This generation delivers up to 2× higher remote storage performance compared to Ebsv5, enabling greater workload consolidation and efficiency. With an [NVMe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/enable-nvme-faqs) interface for both local and remote disks, these VMs provide fast, low-latency storage access. The VM series also offers flexible configurations, with options for local SSD across multiple VM sizes.\n\n##### **Key feature improvements compared to the previous generation Ebsv5 Intel based VMs including:**\n\n- Up to 15-30% better CPU performance, powered by the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8573C (Emerald Rapids) processor​\n- Up to 192 vCPU and 1832 GiB memory\n- Azure Boost which enables up to:\n- 800K IOPS and 14GB/s remote storage throughput with Premium v2 and Ultra Disk support\n- 15% higher remote storage performance per vCPU with up to 6600 IOPS/vCPU\n- 10% higher remote storage throughput per vCPU\n- Increased networking bandwidth, up to 200Gbps\n- Enhanced security through Total Memory Encryption (Intel® TME) technology\n\nIn today’s data-driven world, organizations need to process, analyze, and extract insights from massive datasets quickly and efficiently. Workloads such as OLTP and OLAP, which power real-time transactions and analytics, demand high-performance compute and storage. Azure Ebsv6 VMs are built to meet these challenges by delivering fast, low-latency storage and flexible configurations to support demanding applications.\n\n##### **Ebsv6 & Ebdsv6 Series VM Spec Summary:**\n\n| **VM Series** | **vCPU** | **Memory (GiB)** | **Uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2 IOPS** | **Uncached Ultra Disk and Premium SSD v2 Throughput (MB/s)** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | [Ebsv6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/memory-optimized/ebsv6-series?tabs=sizebasic)/[Ebdsv6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/memory-optimized/ebdsv6-series?tabs=sizebasic) | 2 - 192 | 16 - 1832 | 13200 - 800000 | 330 - 14000 |\n\nFor local temp disk options, please refer to the Ebdsv6 page for full specifications. Whether you choose a VM with a local temp disk or not, you can attach remote persistent disk such as Premium Disk v1, Premium Disk v2, or Ultra Disks to the VMs.\n\n##### **Getting Started:**\n\nThese VMs are available for Public Preview in the **US East** region. To request access to the preview, please fill out this [survey](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR2vQUheGFPhKmch5Uj5LYy5UQlhSTjdFM0lCRVBEQjNWMVgzOTNTWFBSTC4u&route=shorturl).\n\nYou can learn more here:\n\n[Ebsv6-series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/memory-optimized/ebsv6-series?tabs=sizebasic)\n\n[Ebdsv6-series](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/memory-optimized/ebdsv6-series?tabs=sizebasic)\n\n[Ultra Disk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#ultra-disk-limitations)\n\n[Premium SSD v2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssd-v2)\n\n***Have questions?*** Please reach us at [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/) and our experts will be there to help you with your Azure journey.",
