  "Description": "## General Availability announcement\n\nToday marks the general availability of Azure Container Registry (ACR) repository permissions with Microsoft Entra attribute-based access control (ABAC).\n\nABAC augments the familiar Azure RBAC model with namespace and repository-level conditions so platform teams can express least-privilege access at the granularity of specific repositories or entire logical namespaces.

With ABAC, CI/CD systems and runtime consumers like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters have least-privilege access to ACR registries.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nEnterprises are converging on a central container registry pattern that hosts artifacts and container images for multiple business units and application domains. In this model:\n\n- CI/CD pipelines from different parts of the business push container images and artifacts only to approved namespaces and repositories within a central registry.\n- AKS clusters, Azure Container Apps (ACA), Azure Container Instances (ACI), and consumers pull only from authorized repositories within a central registry.\n\n![]()An Azure Container Registry containing images from different business domains across repositories and namespaces.\n\nWith ABAC, these repository and namespace permission boundaries become explicit and enforceable using standard Microsoft Entra identities and role assignments.
