Each sub-agent can have its own instructions, triggers, and toolsets, letting you automate everything from outage response to customer email triage.\n2. **Prebuilt System Tools**: Eliminate the inefficiency of creating basic automation from scratch, and choose from a rich library of hundreds of built-in tools for Azure operations, code analysis, deployment management, diagnostics, and more.\n3. **Custom Logic**: Align automation to your unique business processes by defining your automation logic and prompts, teaching the agent to act exactly as your workflow requires.\n\n### Flexible Triggers: Automate on Your Terms\n\nInvoke the agent to [respond automatically to mission-critical events](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sre-agent/incident-management), not wait for manual commands. This feature helps speed up incident response and eliminate missed opportunities for efficiency.\n\n1. **Multi-Source Triggers**: Go beyond chat-based interactions, and trigger the agent to automatically respond to Incident Management and Ticketing systems like [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) and [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/), Observability Alerting systems like Azure Monitor Alerts, or even on a [cron-based schedule for proactive monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sre-agent/scheduled-tasks) and best-practices checks. Additional trigger sources such as GitHub issues, Azure DevOps pipelines, email, etc. will be added over time. This means automation can start exactly when and where you need it.\n2. **Event-Driven Operations**: Integrate with your CI/CD, monitoring, or support systems to launch automations in response to real-world events - like deployments, incidents, or customer requests. Vital for reducing downtime, it ensures that business-critical actions happen automatically and promptly.\n\n### Expanded Data Connectivity: Unified Observability and Troubleshooting\n\nIntegrate data, enabling comprehensive diagnostics and troubleshooting and faster, more informed decision-making by eliminating silos and speeding up issue resolution.\n\n1. **Multiple Data Sources**: The agent can now read data from Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights based on its Azure role-based access control (RBAC). Additional observability data sources such as [Dynatrace](https://aka.ms/sreagent/dynatrace), [New Relic](https://aka.ms/sreagent/newrelic), [Datadog](https://aka.ms/sreagent/datadog), and more can be added via the Remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for these tools. This gives you a unified view for diagnostics and automation.\n2. **Knowledge Integration**: Rather than manually detailing every instruction in your prompt, you can upload your Troubleshooting Guide (TSG) or Runbook directly, allowing the agent to automatically create an execution plan from the file. You may also connect the agent to resources like [SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), or documentation repositories through Remote MCP servers, enabling it to retrieve needed files on its own. This approach utilizes your organization’s existing knowledge base, streamlining onboarding and enhancing consistency in managing incidents.\n\nAzure SRE Agent is also building multi-agent collaboration by integrating with [PagerDuty](https://aka.ms/sreagent/pagerduty) and [Neubird](https://aka.ms/sreagent/neubird), enabling advanced, cross-platform incident management and reliability across diverse environments.\n\n### Custom Actions: Automate Anything, Anywhere\n\nExtend automation beyond Azure and integrate with any tool or workflow, solving the problem of limited automation scope and enabling end-to-end process orchestration.\n\n1. **Out-of-the-Box Actions**: Instantly automate common tasks like running azcli, kubectl, creating GitHub issues, or updating Azure resources, reducing setup time and operational overhead.\n2. **Communication Notifications**: The SRE Agent now features built-in connectors for Outlook, enabling automated email notifications, and for Microsoft Teams, allowing it to post messages directly to Teams channels for streamlined communication.\n3. **Bring Your Own Actions**: Drop in your own Remote MCP servers to extend the agent’s capabilities to any custom tool or workflow.
