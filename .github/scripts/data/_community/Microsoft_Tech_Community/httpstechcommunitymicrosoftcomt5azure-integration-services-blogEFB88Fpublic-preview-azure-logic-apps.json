This unlocks a seamless way for developers to give their agents secure, governed access to the systems they rely on—without writing boilerplate authentication code or managing API plumbing.\n\nWith this feature, agents can now use any Logic Apps connector—including SAP, ServiceNow, Dynamics, Salesforce, SQL, GitHub, and hundreds more—as a first-class MCP tool inside Foundry. This builds on our recent Public Preview [of Logic Apps MCP Servers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/introducing-logic-apps-mcp-servers-public-preview/4450419), which enable both connectors and workflows to be exposed as MCP tools.\n\n## How it works\n\n**Step 1 — Select a Logic Apps connector as a tool**\n\nIn the Agent Tools catalog, you’ll now find Logic Apps connectors available alongside existing MCP tools. You can search by name or filter to show only Logic Apps connectors (marked with the *Custom* tag). After selecting a connector, you’ll move on to choosing a Logic App resource.\n\n**Step 2 — Create or select a Standard Logic App**\n\nLogic Apps connectors require a Standard Logic Apps resource as their host.  If you don’t already have one, a new Logic App will be created automatically. If you do, you’ll see a dropdown allowing you to pick an existing Logic App.\n\n**Step 3 — Configure the connector as an MCP server**\n\nThis is where Logic Apps provides its power and flexibility. You effectively generate an MCP server using your connector:\n\n- Choose which operations you want to expose\n- Optionally configure parameter behavior\n- Specify whether parameters are provided by the model or the user\n- Review or edit the autogenerated tool description based on the connector’s OpenAPI definition\n\nParameters that require user input are clearly indicated in the UI.\n\n**Step 4 — Register the MCP server as a tool in Foundry**\n\nThis flow begins in the Azure portal and completes in the Foundry portal. After registration completes, your tool appears in the Agent tool list—ready to be added to any agent. In the Connected Resources view, you’ll also see the Logic Apps resource that backs your MCP tool.\n\nIn just a few steps, agents can now use Logic Apps connectors natively, unlocking secure enterprise connectivity without custom code.\n\nFoundry continues to support custom MCP servers, including those created from Logic Apps workflows themselves. If you want to expose a workflow as an MCP tool, you can do so with the same mechanism. (See our [detailed document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/set-up-model-context-protocol-server-standard) on converting workflows to MCP tools.)\n\n## Roadmap\n\n**Unified Experience**Today, the flow spans the Azure portal and the Foundry portal. A fully Foundry-native experience is coming in an upcoming release.\n\n**OAuth-based First-Party Connectors** Some first-party connectors using OAuth are not yet supported. These will be enabled in the near future.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Watch this short demo video to see the feature in action.\n- Get started with the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/add-agent-tools-connector-actions) to try it yourself.\n\nUpdated Nov 25, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[ai](/tag/ai?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[logic apps standard](/tag/logic%20apps%20standard?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[DivSwa&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xNTYxNTYzLTQxNzI3NmlGRjYyMDM2MjI1MjVFMjhD?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/divswa/1561563) [DivSwa](/users/divswa/1561563) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined October 11, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/divswa/1561563)\n\n/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog [Azure Integration Services Blog](/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
