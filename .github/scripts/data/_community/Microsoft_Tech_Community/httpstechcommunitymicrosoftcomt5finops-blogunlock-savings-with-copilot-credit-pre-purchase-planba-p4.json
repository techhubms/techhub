To help you plan confidently and save more, we’re introducing **Copilot Credit Pre-Purchase Plan (P3)\\***, **** a simple, one‑year plan that delivers volume discounts and automatic billing, so your team can focus on outcomes, not invoices.\n\n## What is Copilot Credit Pre-Purchase Plan?\n\nThe P3 is a **one‑year, pay‑up‑front option** for Copilot Credits. You purchase **Copilot Credit Commit Units (CCCU)** and your usage automatically draws from this pool. Higher tiers unlock **progressive discounts** enabling more growth. [See pricing here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320995).\n\n## How it works\n\n- You **pre-purchase a pool of Copilot Credits Commit Unit** (CCCUs) for one year.\n- Every time you use Copilot Credits for Microsoft Copilot Studio, Dynamics 365 first-party agents, or Copilot Chat\\*, the CCCUs are **automatically drawn down** from your P3 balance.\n- If you use up your balance before the year ends, you can **add another P3 plan** or switch to **pay-as-you-go**.\n- If you don’t use all your credits by the end of the year, the remaining balance **expires**.\n\n## Example:\n\nA retail company runs 15 custom Copilot Studio agents to handle inventory checks, store operations, and customer service. They expect seasonal spike (holiday campaigns, back-to-school, and clearance events) but want predictable costs.\n\n**Without P3:** On the **pay-as-you-go** model their total cost can vary and spike as their usage goes up and down. During peak months, usage surges, and so does the bill make budgeting tough.\n\n**With P3:** Based on forecasting they expect to use **1,500,000 Copilot Credits** over 12 months. Because they know how many Copilot Credits they plan on consuming, the retail company buys **P3**:\n\n- **Purchase P3 Tier 2: 15,000 CCCUs (this covers 1,500,000 Copilot Credits)**\n- **P3 Upfront cost:** $14,100\n- **P3 discount:** 6% vs PAYG\n\nNow, every time their agents run, CCCUs are **automatically deducted from the P3 balance**.\n\n**P3 Tiers:**\n\nPricing as of October 2025, subject to change. [See pricing here.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320995)\n\n##\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Cost savings**: Up to 20% discount at highest tier\\*\\*.\n- **Budget predictability**: One‑year term with upfront payment and no surprise bills.\n- **Flexibility**: Add more P3 anytime; works alongside capacity packs and PAYG.\n- **No redeployment**: Applies automatically to eligible usage.\n- **Defined Scope**: Decide where the P3 applies based on your business needs. It can be applied at the resource group, subscription, management group, or shared level.\n\n## How to Purchase Copilot Studio Pre-purchase plan\n\n- Sign in to the **Azure portal** → **Reservations** → **+ Add** → **Copilot Credit Pre‑purchase Plan**.\n- Select your **subscription** and **scope**\n- Choose your **tier** and complete payment.\n- Link your subscription to Copilot Studio in **Power Platform Admin Center**.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Estimate accurately**: Use historical usage or [Copilot consumption estimator.](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-studio-estimator/)\n- **Deploy first**: Ensure environments are PAYG‑enabled before buying.\n- **Monitor utilization**: Set alerts to avoid unexpected PAYG charges.\n- **Plan for renewal**: Auto‑renew is on by default; adjust as needed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf you’re scaling fast or managing multiple environments, P3 gives you **predictable costs and meaningful savings** without sacrificing flexibility. It’s ideal for customers with **variable or growing usage** who want to optimize spend and simplify billing.\n\nCopilot Credit Pre-Purchase Plan makes it easier to innovate without worrying about unpredictable costs. By committing upfront, you unlock discounts, streamline billing, and gain confidence in your budget.\n\n**Ready to start?** Visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to purchase your plan today or read the [Copilot Credits Pre-purchase Plans documents](https://aka.ms/copilotP3) to learn more.\n\n**** **Resources:**\n\n- [Read how to confidently scale AI agent deployments with Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/P3Blog)\n- [Learn more about Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio)\n- [See Microsoft Copilot Studio Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320995)\n\n*\\*Copilot Credit covers Microsoft Copilot Studio, Dynamics 365 first-party agents, and Copilot Chat.
