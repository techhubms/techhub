Every time I log in, it keeps showing error messages related to tenant access, and I cannot perform any normal operation inside Azure. It does not allow me to proceed, create resources, or even navigate the portal pages.\n\nSince this account is the one I planned to use for my Power Platform / Developer environment setup, this issue is now blocking all further development work.\n\nCould you please help me check the tenant status of this account, and fix the access issue so that I can properly use Azure Portal again?\n\nThank you very much for your assistance.\n\nBest regards",
