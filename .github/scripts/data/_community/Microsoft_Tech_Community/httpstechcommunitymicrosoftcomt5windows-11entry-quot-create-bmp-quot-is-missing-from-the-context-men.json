I had a look into the new Paint-Program and decided that only a mother could like it. I uninstalled it and installed 'Classic Paint', not from the Windows Store (because I did not find it there), but from a different site.\n\nAfterwards I noticed that there is a missing bmp in the context menue \"New Entry\". Okay, technically I don't know if Win11 put it there in the first place and I just didn't notice it missing, but I assume for now that it's a result of me uninstalling Win11-Paint.\n\nTo what registry-entry must I sacrifice my firstborn son to get it back?\n\nI am running Windows 11 Professional, today's version, fully updated, but mutiliated through explorer-patcher. If you need more information I will get it to you, but maybe that's enough.",
