  "Description": "I’m using Microsoft Edge with two separate profiles, each signed in with a different Microsoft/Azure AD account and syncing independently. Sync works fine, but I noticed something odd:\n\nWhen I’m in my second profile, I can still see the account from my first profile listed as an available sign-in option (and vice versa). It seems that all accounts I use in Edge show up in every profile, even though I only want each account to exist in its own profile.\n\nFrom my understanding, profiles should be isolated, but it looks like Edge (or Windows) is pulling all accounts from a shared system account store. This isn’t ideal for me, as I want strict separation between profiles.\n\nMy questions:\n\nIs there a way to prevent accounts from one profile showing up in another?\n\nCan Edge profiles be configured to not share the same system account list?\n\nIs this behavior by design, or am I missing a setting somewhere?\n\nI’m on Windows 11, latest version of Edge.",
