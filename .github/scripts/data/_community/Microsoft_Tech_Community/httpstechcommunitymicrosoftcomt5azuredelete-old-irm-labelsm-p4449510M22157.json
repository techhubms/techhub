  "EnhancedContent": "Hi,\n\nWe just started using Purview and I want to set up Sensitivity Labels to protect information. Currently there are no sensitivity labels set up or visible in Purview.\n\nHowever, in Office Apps I can still see some Rights Management protection labels which were set up 10 years ago or more. I think these may have been set using AD RMS in our online Microsoft domain but I am not sure. They were never used and there are no documents protected using these labels. (To explain where I can see them: in Excel for example they are listed under File &gt; Protect Workbook &gt; Restrict Access)\n\nI would like to get rid of these old labels so we can start clean using new sensitivity labels in Purview, but I can't find them listed anywhere and I can't find any articles that seem to cover this.\n\nI would be very grateful if anyone could explain how to list and hopefully delete these old labels so we can start fresh.\n\nMany thanks.",
