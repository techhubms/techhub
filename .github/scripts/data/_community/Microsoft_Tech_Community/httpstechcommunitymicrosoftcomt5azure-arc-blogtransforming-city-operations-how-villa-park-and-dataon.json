Working directly with Microsoft's engineering team and a forward-thinking city partner, we've proven that Azure Local delivers practical AI value for government operations. We're excited to help other municipalities achieve similar results on our Azure Local platform.”*\n> >\n\nVilla Park’s deployment leverages DataON’s Azure Local-certified hardware, Microsoft’s Arc-enabled AI stack, and the expertise of city planners to deliver:\n\n- End-to-end digital workflows for CEQA, zoning, and ADU permitting\n\n- **Conversational AI interfaces** that empower staff to ask questions and get cited, regulatory-compliant answers instantly\n\n- **Operational resilience** with **full offline support**, ensuring continuity even during network outages\n\n- A **replicable model for other municipalities**seeking to modernize planning and compliance\n\n#### About DataON\n\nDataON’s edge infrastructure, combined with Azure Local and Edge RAG, forms the core of this transformation. DataON provides robust hardware and delivers deployment, integration, and training services, ensuring a seamless Azure Local experience. Their close support helps organizations quickly adopt and confidently manage edge solutions, resulting in secure, high-performance, and scalable deployments for multi-site environments.\n\n#### Let’s take a closer look at the features we’re announcing today:\n\n###### **Deep Search for Complex Reasoning with LazyGarph RAG**\n\n###### With the Ignite release, Edge RAG introduces Deep Search powered by LazyGraph RAG; a dynamic graph-based retrieval method that enables advanced, multi-document reasoning. This means Villa Park planners can now ask complex, multi-part questions that span zoning, CEQA, and ADU regulations, and Edge RAG will synthesize answers by connecting information from multiple sources in real time.\n\nImage 1: Deep Search capabilities on Edge RAG\n\nThe system incrementally explores only the most relevant document chunks, reducing compute cost and latency while delivering comprehensive, cited responses. For Villa Park, this translates to resolving intricate regulatory scenarios, such as “What are the environmental constraints for ADUs in zones X, Y, and Z?”. With answers that reference and link multiple regulatory documents and historical decisions, all in a single query.\n\n**Advanced Document Parsing for Structured Data**\n\nEdge RAG’s advanced document parsing, introduced in this release, transforms how Villa Park’s planning documents are utilized. During data ingestion, the system now extracts not only free-form text but also tables, images, headings, and rich metadata. This includes full indexing of multi-page tables, column headers, and section context, with each chunk annotated by page number, section heading, and table index. As a result, planners can search for specific permit statistics, environmental impact scores, or compliance tables and retrieve results directly from structured data within city documents; enabling precise, source-attributed answers that were previously difficult or impossible to obtain.\n\nImage 2: Advanced document parsing on Edge RAG\n\n**Enhanced Chat Experience**\n\nThe new model-only chat mode allows staff to interact directly with the language model, bypassing contextual data for general queries or troubleshooting. This flexibility enables Villa Park staff to quickly switch between knowledge-based chat-grounded in city data, and model-only chat for training, testing, or handling ambiguous queries, streamlining both day-to-day operations and onboarding of new team members.\n\n##### Additional Edge RAG Preview Refresh Updates\n\nWe also improved Edge RAG based on customer feedback, adding these features:\n\n- **Agentic RAG for autonomous workflows****:** Systems can reason and act at the edge with less manual work.\n\n- **Full offline support****:**Operates and accesses data even without a network.\n\n- **SharePoint integration (private preview)****:**users will also be able to query Edge RAG directly over SharePoint, enabling enhanced information retrieval and analysis within their workflows.\n\nImage 3: Sharepoint as a data source on Edge RAG\n\n- **Performance optimizations****:** Query responses for every search type, excluding Deep Search, are now delivered in under 15 seconds on legacy A2 and A16 GPUs; a fivefold speed boost. Additionally, streaming image processing has increased one hundred times, allowing 600 images to be handled continuously in just 36 seconds.\n\nSince late May, Edge RAG has supported “bring your own model” (BYOM), allowing organizations to deploy their preferred language models such as OpenAI GPT-4o or other advanced models, directly on their own infrastructure. This capability enables advanced features like deep search and hybrid multimodal search, while ensuring that sensitive data remains on-premises. BYOM empowers organizations to tailor Edge RAG’s AI capabilities to their unique compliance, performance, or customization requirements, maintaining full control over both data and model selection.\n\n#### Security, Compliance, and Sustainability\n\nEdge RAG is built for trust: data sovereignty ensures sensitive data remains on-premises, zero-trust architecture integrates with Microsoft security stack, and compliance-ready design supports municipal, state, and industry regulations. Sustainability is also a priority, with energy-efficient edge hardware reducing carbon footprint.\n\n#### Looking Ahead: The Future of Edge Intelligence\n\nEdge RAG enables flexible edge intelligence deployment in various environments. Its adaptable design handles dynamic workloads, supporting frontline teams as operations evolve. Instead of just speeding up processes or boosting connectivity, Edge RAG fosters innovative applications and smarter decision-making, helping organizations stay agile amid changing technology and business needs.\n\n#### Resources\n\nExplore these resources to learn more about Edge RAG, deployment best practices, customer stories, and technical documentation:\n\n- Product documentation: [Edge RAG Preview, enabled by Azure Arc Documentation | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/edge-rag/)\n\n- Get Started: [Quickstart: Install Edge RAG Preview enabled by Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/edge-rag/quickstart-edge-rag)\n\n- Release notes: [What's New in Edge RAG – Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/edge-rag/whats-new)\n\n- Tech Talk Distribution List: [EdgeRAGTalk@microsoft.com](mailto:EdgeRAGTalk@microsoft.com)\nJoin the conversation, ask questions, and connect with the Edge RAG team\n\n**Recommended Ignite sessions:**\n\n- [BRK147](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fignite.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Fsessions%2FBRK147%3Fsource%3Dsessions&amp;data=05%7C02%7CInbal.Sagiv%40microsoft.com%7Cfad046de77f644c394ea08de23a423f7%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638987385326027450%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=DfSji8Cc%2BtZ9j7rlxMSGpKEzxx2qwTt7fzhnz%2FpAAiQ%3D&amp;reserved=0): What’s new in Azure Local\n\n- [ODSP1467](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fignite.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Fsessions%2FODSP1467%3Fsource%3Dsessions&amp;data=05%7C02%7CInbal.Sagiv%40microsoft.com%7Cfad046de77f644c394ea08de23a423f7%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638987385326264555%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=VxYY2ORwZBBGQhk%2B%2BLCKgp%2BxJ63EQaxD%2B5PzcviYhh4%3D&amp;reserved=0): Unlock your IT potential with Azure Local & DataON Plus Solutions\n\n- [BRK199](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fignite.microsoft.com%2Fen-US%2Fsessions%2FBRK199%3Fsource%3Dsessions&amp;data=05%7C02%7CInbal.Sagiv%40microsoft.com%7Cfad046de77f644c394ea08de23a423f7%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638987385326197885%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=VyBSYQ8wUAitN1XH%2BJGmGOZAPPX4IKMVQGTz5DyEBvY%3D&amp;reserved=0): From cloud to edge: Building and shipping Edge AI apps with Foundry\n\nUpdated Nov 18, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[adaptive cloud](/tag/adaptive%20cloud?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[azure arc](/tag/azure%20arc?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[hybrid](/tag/hybrid?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[kubernetes](/tag/kubernetes?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[msignite](/tag/msignite?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[!\\[moran_assaf&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0zMDI4MjgzLXhqMlByYg?image-coordinates=0%2C0%2C800%2C800&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/moran_assaf/3028283) [moran_assaf](/users/moran_assaf/3028283) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined May 11, 2025\n\n[View Profile](/users/moran_assaf/3028283)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurearcblog [Azure Arc Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurearcblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
