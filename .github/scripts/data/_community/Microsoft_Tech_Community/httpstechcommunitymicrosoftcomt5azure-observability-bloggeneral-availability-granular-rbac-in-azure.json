  "Description": "We’re excited to announce the **general availability of Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Azure Monitor Logs**!\n\nThis capability enables you to set **fine-grained data access control at the row level**, giving you more flexibility and security when managing log data.\n\nBack in **May 2025**, [we introduced this feature in public preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azureobservabilityblog/public-preview-granular-rbac-in-azure-monitor-logs/4417231). Today, it’s fully available and ready for production use\n\n#### **What is Granular RBAC?**\n\nOrganizations often need to **segregate and control access to data** without trading off the benefits of a centralized logging platform. Granular RBAC builds on existing Azure RBAC capabilities for workspace and table-level access, allowing you to:\n\n- Apply **least privilege access** at any level, **workspace, table, or row level security.**\n- Maintain all your data in a single Log Analytics workspace.\n- Separate **data plane** and **control plane** access using **Azure Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** as part of your RBAC role assignments.\n\nWith Granular RBAC, you can filter which data each user can view or query based on conditions you define such as organizational roles, geographic regions, or data sensitivity levels.\n\n#### **What’s New?**\n\n- **Broad Availability**: Granular RBAC is now supported in **Azure Public Cloud**, **Azure Government (GCC)**, and **Azure China**.\n- **New Built-in Role**: The **Log Analytics Data Reader** role now fully supports Granular RBAC for an out-of-the-box experience. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/manage-access?tabs=portal)\n\n#### **Get Started**\n\n[**Learn more about Granular RBAC and how to set it up in Azure Monitor Logs**](https://aka.ms/LogsGranularRBAC)\n\nWe hope you enjoy this new addition to Azure Monitor Log Analytics.",
