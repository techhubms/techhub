Customize dashboards in Grafana or Azure Monitor Workbooks to detect regressions instantly after a model or prompt change—and understand how those changes affect user experience and spend.\n\n- AI-Tailored Trace View – Follow every AI decision as a readable story: plan → reasoning → tool calls → guardrail checks. Identify slow or unsafe steps in seconds, without sifting through thousands of spans.\n\n- AI-Aware Trace Search by Attributes – Search, sort, and filter across millions of runs using GenAI-specific attributes like model ID, grounding score, or cost.
