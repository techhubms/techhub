  "Description": "## Aggregate and analyze storage metrics from multiple storage accounts in a single chart.\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce a highly requested feature: **Cross Resource Metrics and Alerts** support for **Azure Storage**!\n\nWith this new capability, you can now **monitor and visualize metrics across multiple storage accounts** in a **single chart** and **configure alerts across multiple accounts** — within the same subscription and region. This makes managing large fleets of storage accounts significantly easier and more powerful.\n\n# What’s New\n\n**Cross Resource Metrics Support**\n\n- Visualize aggregated metric data across multiple storage accounts.\n- Break down metrics by individual resources in a sorted and ordered way.\n\n**Cross Resource Alerting Support**\n\n- Create a **single alert rule** that monitors a metric across many storage accounts and triggers an action when thresholds are crossed on any resource.\n\n**Full Metric Namespace Support**\n\n- Works across **Blob**, **File**, **Table**, and **Queue** metric namespaces.\n- All existing storage metrics are supported for cross resource visualization and alerting.\n\n# Why This Matters\n\n**Centralized Monitoring for Large Environments**\n\n- Manage and monitor dozens (or hundreds) of storage accounts at once with a unified view.\n\n**Fleet-wide Alerting**\n\n- Set up a single alert that covers your whole storage fleet, ensuring you are quickly notified if **any** account experiences performance degradation or other issues.\n\n**Operational Efficiency**\n\n- Helps operations teams scale monitoring efforts without needing to configure and manage separate dashboards and alerts for each account individually.\n\n# How To Get Started\n\n## Step 1: Create a Cross Resource Metrics Chart\n\n- Go to **Azure Monitor** **->** **Metrics**.\n- Scope Selection:\n- Under **Select a scope**, select the same Metric Namespace (blob/file/queue/table) for multiple **Storage Accounts** from the same **Subscription** and **Region**.\n- Click **Apply**.\n- In the below example, two storage accounts have been selected for metrics in the blob metric namespace.\n\n![]()\n\n- **Configure Metric Chart**:\n- Select a **Metric** (e.g., Blob Capacity, Transactions, Ingress)\n-\n- **Aggregation**:\n- - By default, a **Split by** clause on *ResourceId* is applied to view individual account breakdowns.\n- Or view **aggregated** data across all selected accounts by removing the **Split by** clause.\n\n![]()\n\n## **Example**\n\nAs another example, lets monitor total transactions across storage accounts on the **Hot** tier to view aggregate or per-account breakdown in a single graph.\n\n- From the same view, select the Transactions metric instead.\n- Select 5 storage accounts by using the **Add Filter** clause and filtering by the *ResourceId* property.\n- Add another filter and select a specific *tier,* say **Hot.** This will show aggregated transactions on data in the Hot tier per minute across all selected storage accounts.\n\n![]()\n\n- Select **Apply Splitting** and select *ResourceId* to view an ordered breakdown of transactions per minute for all the Storage accounts in scope. In this specific example, only 4 storage accounts are shown since 1 storage account is excluded based on the *Tier* filter.\n\n![]()\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Cross Resource Alert Rules\n\n- Click on **New alert rule** from the chart view shown above in order to create an alert that spans the 5 storage accounts above and get alerted when any account breaches a certain transactions limit over a 5 minute period**.**\n- Configure required values for the **Threshold**, **Unit** and **Value is** fields. This defines when the alert should fire (e.g., Transactions > 5000)\n- Under the **Split by dimensions** section, ensure that the Microsoft.ResourceId dimension is not included.\n\n![]()\n\n- Under **Actions,** attach an **Action Group** (Email, Webhook, Logic App, etc.).\n- **Review and Create**.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nCross Resource Metrics and Alerts for Azure Storage makes monitoring and management at scale much more intuitive and efficient. Whether you're overseeing 5 storage accounts or 500, you can now **visualize performance** and **respond to issues** faster than ever. And you can do it for metrics across multiple storage services including blobs, queues, files and tables!\n\nWe can't wait to hear how you use this feature!
