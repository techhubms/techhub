  "Description": "This blog was originally posted to the [App Service team blog](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/08/25/BYOL-Support-for-JBoss.html)\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to announce that Azure App Service now supports Bring Your Own License (BYOL) for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP), enabling enterprise customers to deploy Java workloads with greater flexibility and cost efficiency.\n\nIf you‚Äôve evaluated Azure App Service in the past, now is the perfect time to take another look. With BYOL support, you can leverage your existing Red Hat subscriptions to optimize costs and align with your enterprise licensing strategy.\n\n## üß© What Is BYOL for JBoss EAP?\n\nBYOL allows customers with existing **Red Hat subscriptions** to apply those licenses directly to their JBoss EAP deployments on Azure App Service. This model complements the existing **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)** option, giving customers more control over licensing costs and compliance.\n\nWith BYOL, customers:\n\n- Avoid paying the built-in license fee in PAYG plans.\n- Leverage their Red Hat Cloud Access entitlements.\n- Maintain consistency with on-prem licensing strategies.\n\nThis capability is part of a broader effort to make Azure the best cloud for enterprise Java workloads.\n\n## üí° Why BYOL Matters\n\nJBoss EAP powers mission-critical applications across industries. Until now, customers migrating to Azure App Service had to rely on PAYG licensing, which could be cost-prohibitive for large-scale deployments. BYOL changes that by:\n\n- Reducing total cost of ownership.\n- Supporting license portability via Red Hat Cloud Access.\n- Aligning cloud deployments with existing enterprise agreements.\n\nThis feature was developed jointly by Microsoft and Red Hat and is supported across multiple hosting options including Azure VMs, Azure Red Hat OpenShift, and now App Service.\n\n## üìö Resources and Documentation\n\n- [JBoss EAP on Azure Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/java/ee/jboss-on-azure)\n- [Red Hat Cloud Access Program](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/cloud-access)\n- [Quickstart: Create a Java app on Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-java?pivots=java-jboss)\n\n## ‚úçÔ∏è Final Thoughts\n\nBYOL support for JBoss EAP on Azure App Service is a game-changer for enterprise Java customers. It empowers organizations to modernize their applications on Azure while preserving existing licensing investments. Whether you‚Äôre migrating from on-prem or scaling new workloads, BYOL offers the flexibility and savings you need.\n\nIf you‚Äôre ready to get started, check out the [deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-java-jboss-mysql-app) or reach out to your Microsoft or Red Hat account team for assistance.",
