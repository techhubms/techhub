What are your responsibilities?\n\nI’m an Azure Integration Architect at Cnext, helping organizations modernize and migrate their integrations to Azure Integration Services. I design and build solutions using Logic Apps, Azure Functions, Service Bus, and API Management. I also work on AI solutions using Semantic Kernel and LangChain to bring intelligence into business processes.\n\n##### Can you give us some insights into your day-to-day activities and what a typical day in your role looks like?\n\nMy day usually begins by attending customer requests and handling recent deployments. Most of my time goes into designing integration patterns, building Logic Apps, mentoring the team, and helping customers with technical solutions. Lately, I’ve also been integrating AI capabilities into workflows.\n\n##### What motivates and inspires you to be an active member of the Aviators/Microsoft community?\n\nThe community is open, friendly, and full of knowledge. I enjoy sharing ideas, writing posts, and helping others solve real-world challenges. It’s great to learn and grow together.\n\n##### Looking back, what advice do you wish you had been given earlier that you'd now share with those looking to get into STEM/technology?\n\nStart small and stay consistent. Learn the basics well—like messaging, retries, and error handling—before diving into complex tools. Keep learning and share what you know.\n\n##### What has helped you grow professionally?\n\nHands-on experience, teamwork, and continuous learning. Working across different projects taught me how to design reliable and scalable systems. Exploring AI with Semantic Kernel and LangChain has also helped me think beyond traditional integrations.\n\n##### If you had a magic wand that could create a feature in Logic Apps, what would it be and why?\n\nI’d add an “Overview Page” in Logic Apps containing the HTTP URLs for each workflow, so developers can quickly access to test from one place. It would save time and make working with multiple workflows much easier.\n\n# News from our product group\n\n| | [Logic Apps Community Day 2025 Playlist](https://aka.ms/lacommunityday25/playlist)<br><br><br>Did you miss or want to catch up on  individual sessions from Logic Apps Community Day 2025?
