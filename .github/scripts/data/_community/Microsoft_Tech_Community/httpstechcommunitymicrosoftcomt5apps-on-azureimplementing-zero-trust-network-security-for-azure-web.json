  "EnhancedContent": "Author: Sai Min Thu Date: 7.9.2025 Lab Objective: To demonstrate how to completely remove public internet access from an Azure App Service Web App and secure it within a private virtual network using Private Endpoints, adhering to a zero-trust network model.\n\nIn today's threat landscape, the principle of \"never trust, always verify\" is paramount. While Azure Web Apps are publicly accessible by default, many enterprise scenarios require workloads to be isolated from the public internet to meet strict compliance and security requirements.\n\nThis guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of configuring an Azure Web App to be accessible only through a private network connection via an Azure Private Endpoint. We will:\n\n1. Establish a foundational resource group and virtual network.\n2. Deploy a basic web application.\n3. Implement core security controls by creating a Private Endpoint and integrating with Private DNS.\n4. Enforce network isolation by applying access restrictions.\n5. Validate the security configuration.\n\nDocuments Details: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ci17PsPCILbP8JVZMMLkjAolHK3pomgT-RE76InEkqA/edit?usp=sharing",
