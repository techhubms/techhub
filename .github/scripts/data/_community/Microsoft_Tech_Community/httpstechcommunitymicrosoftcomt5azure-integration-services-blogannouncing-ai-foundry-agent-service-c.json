  "Description": "We have recently made some updates to the AI Foundry Agent Service connector that allows Azure Logic Apps to call the latest AI Foundry Agent API via our connector and streamline AI integration for enterprises. It delivers secure, governed connectivity through, accelerates deployment with low-code design, and scales globally. This approach embeds advanced AI into business processes without custom code, reducing complexity and driving faster time-to-value.\n\nThere are a few different use cases that are unlocked as a result of these investments:\n\n- Leveraging Logic Apps large connector library and vast collection of triggers that allow you to subscribe to events in the enterprise and hand off to a foundry-hosted agent. For example, you can subscribe to a new document being added a SharePoint list and then pass the content from that SharePoint document to the Foundry agent.\n- Another use case my be polling a mailbox for new messages that meet your filter criteria. Those messages and attachments can subsequently be retrieved and passed to the Foundry agent.\n- Agentic business processes built with Logic Apps and Agent Loop allow for multi-agent solutions where Logic Apps can participate in the broader agent ecosystem and leverage agents built using AI Foundry.\n\n## New Operations\n\nThe 3 new operations include:\n\n- **External agent activity protocol based on application:** track and manage activities across agents operating within a particular application context\n- **External agent activity protocol based on agent identifier:** track and manage activities for a specific agent by its unique identifier, enabling monitoring, auditing, and external control of that agent’s actions.\n- **Invoke Agent:** used to trigger an agent to perform a specific task or action within an orchestration or agent-based system.\n\n![]()![]()\n\n## Demo\n\nIn the following video, we will take a look at a demo on how we can use Logic Apps to invoke a Foundry Agent.",
