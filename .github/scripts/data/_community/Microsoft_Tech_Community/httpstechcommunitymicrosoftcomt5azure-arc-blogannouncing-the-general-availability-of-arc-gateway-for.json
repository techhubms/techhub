  "EnhancedContent": "Hello everyone,\n\nNow that the [Azure Arc gateway is GA](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearcblog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-the-azure-arc-gateway-for-arc-enabled-ser/4456356) is announced, we are super happy to also announce the General Availability of  the Arc Gateway for Azure Local! This launch represents a major leap forward in how organizations can securely and efficiently connect their on-premises and edge environments to Azure.\n\n#### **Arc Gateway revolutionizes Azure Local connectivity to Azure**\n\nIf you’ve ever tried to connect on-premises resources to Azure, you know the challenges: dozens (sometimes hundreds!) of outbound firewall rules, complex configurations, and ongoing security concerns. It’s a lot to manage, and frankly, it’s not the experience we want for our customers or partners.\n\nArc Gateway changes the game. With a single, centralized HTTPS egress point for all Azure-bound traffic from your Azure Local instances and workloads, you dramatically reduce complexity and risk. Instead of managing countless endpoints, you only need to allow a small, well-defined set—making your environment more secure and much easier to operate.\n\n#### **What Makes Arc Gateway for Azure Local to Stand Out?**\n\nLet me highlight what makes Arc Gateway stand out:\n\n- **Unified and secure Azure Traffic Management:** All HTTPS traffic from your Azure Local instances flows through one front door—the Arc Gateway. No more sprawling firewall rules or wildcards.\n- **Significantly Fewer Endpoints:** We’ve reduced the number of required endpoints from over 100 to fewer than 28. This means less guess work and a much simpler security posture.\n- **Comprehensive Integration for your workloads:** Arc Gateway isn’t just for infrastructure endpoints. It also fully supports Azure Local VMs with Arc gateway, and AKS clusters in preview mode, streamlining connectivity across your entire hybrid estate.\n- **Seamless Enterprise Proxy Integration:** Already using an enterprise proxy? Arc Gateway fits right in, routing outbound traffic through your existing proxy before heading to Azure.\n\nFor a deeper technical dive, I encourage you to check out our detailed article: [Azure Local – Arc gateway outbound connectivity deep dive](https://github.com/Azure/AzureLocal-Supportability/blob/main/TSG/Networking/Arc-Gateway-Outbound-Connectivity/DeepDive-ArcGateway-Outbound-Traffic.md)\n\n#### **FAQs:**\n\n**Is it possible to enable Arc gateway on my existing Azure local clusters?**\n\n- We are working hard to enable this feature in a future release of Azure Local.\n\n**Can I enable Arc gateway on my existing Azure Local VMs if it was not enabled for the infrastructure during deployment?**\n\n- Using Arc gateway for your Azure Local VMs is possible regardless of the infrastructure. If you have a working Arc gateway resource you can deploy new Azure Local VMs or attach existing Azure Local VMs if guest management is enabled.\n\n**Can I enable Arc gateway on my existing Azure Local AKS Clusters?**\n\n- If you enabled Arc gateway during deployment for the Azure Local infrastructure, AKS Clusters will implicitly leverage the Arc gateway running on the hosts. AKS Clusters running in Azure Local with Arc gateway will remain in Public Preview until GA is released in the future.\n\n##### **Getting Started:**\n\nTo get started with Arc gateway for Azure Local, visit our documentation and deployment guides.
