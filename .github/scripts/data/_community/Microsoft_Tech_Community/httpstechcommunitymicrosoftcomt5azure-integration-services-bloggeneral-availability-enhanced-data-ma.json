This release marks a major milestone in our journey to modernize and streamline data transformation workflows for integration developer.\n\n### What's new\n\nThe new UX, previously available in public preview, is now the **default experience** in the Logic Apps Standard extension.\n\n![]()\n\nThis GA release reflects direct feedback from our integration developer community. Weâ€™ve resolved **blockers** that we heard from customers and usability issues that impacted performance and stability, including:\n\n- **Opening V1 maps in V2**: Seamlessly open and edit existing maps you have already created with latest visual capabilities.\n- **Load schemas on Mac**: Addressed schema-related crashes on macOS for a smoother experience.\n- **Function documentation updates**: Improved guidance and examples for built-in collection functions that apply on repeating nodes.\n\n### Whatâ€™s coming next\n\nWeâ€™re not stopping here. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of whatâ€™s ahead:\n\n- **Smart mapping**: Schema-aware suggestions to accelerate mapping process and reduce manual effort to drag and drop.\n- **Select root node**: Choose any node from referenced schemas to be root node.\n- **Flat file schema support**: Natively deal with CSV files within Logic Apps to be used for mapping.\n\n### Stay connected\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback.
