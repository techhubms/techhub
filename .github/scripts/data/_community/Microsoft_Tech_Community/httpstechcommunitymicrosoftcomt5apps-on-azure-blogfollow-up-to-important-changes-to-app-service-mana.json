  "Description": "This post provides an update to the Tech Community article [*‘Important Changes to App Service Managed Certificates: Is Your Certificate Affected?’*](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/important-changes-to-app-service-managed-certificates-is-your-certificate-affect/4435193) and covers the latest changes introduced since July 2025. With the November 2025 update, ASMC now remains supported even if the site is not publicly accessible, provided all other requirements are met. Details on requirements, exceptions, and validation steps are included below.\n\n## Background Context to July 2025 Changes\n\nAs of July 2025, all ASMC certificate issuance and renewals use HTTP token validation. Previously, public access was required because DigiCert needed to access the endpoint *https:///.well-known/pki-validation/fileauth.txt* to verify the token before issuing the certificate. App Service automatically places this token during certificate creation and renewal. If DigiCert cannot access this endpoint, domain ownership validation fails, and the certificate cannot be issued.\n\n## October 2025 Update\n\nStarting October 2025, App Service now allows DigiCert's requests to the *https:///.well-known/pki-validation/fileauth.txt* endpoint, even if the site blocks public access. If there’s a request to create an App Service Managed Certificate (ASMC), App Service places the domain validation token at the validation endpoint. When DigiCert tries to reach the validation endpoint, App Service [front ends](https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/february/azure-inside-the-azure-app-service-architecture#front-end) present the token, and the request terminates at the front end layer. DigiCert's request does not reach the [workers](https://learn.microsoft.com/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/february/azure-inside-the-azure-app-service-architecture#web-workers) running the application.\n\nThis behavior is now the default for ASMC issuance for initial certificate creation and renewals. Customers do not need to specifically allow DigiCert's IP addresses.\n\n## Exceptions and Unsupported Scenarios\n\nThis update addresses most scenarios that restrict public access, including App Service Authentication, disabling public access, IP restrictions, private endpoints, and client certificates. However, **a public DNS record is still required**. For example, sites using a private endpoint with a custom domain on a private DNS cannot validate domain ownership and obtain a certificate.\n\nEven with all validations now relying on HTTP token validation and DigiCert requests being allowed through, certain configurations are still not supported for ASMC:\n\n- Sites configured as \"Nested\" or \"External\" endpoints behind Traffic Manager. Only \"Azure\" endpoints are supported.\n- Certificates requested for domains ending in **\\*.trafficmanager.net** are not supported.\n\n## Testing\n\nCustomers can easily test whether their site’s configuration or set-up supports ASMC by attempting to create one for their site. If the initial request succeeds, renewals should also work, provided all requirements are met and the site is not listed in an unsupported scenario.",
