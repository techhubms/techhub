  "Description": "Hi everyone! I know this is a silly question, but I want to ask why, after connecting my Azure Static Web App to my GitHub and it would connect the Git Workflow, the commit would fail. Although, I haven't finished setting up some other resources yet, and I just connected my StatWebApp URL to my Azure Maps, there are other resources that I still need to deploy, and I still need to properly wire the backend to my Azure AI Services. Thanks in advance!",
