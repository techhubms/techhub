The joint session explores how telcos can break down silos and unlock the full potential of AI by enabling strategic collaboration across systems, teams, and technologies.\n\nThe core challenge they address is clear: AI in isolation cannot answer even the simplest customer questions. Whether it's billing, device performance, or network coverage, fragmented systems lead to blind spots, duplication, and poor customer outcomes. To overcome this, they propose a unified framework that blends **technology** and **culture**‚Äîbecause tech alone doesn‚Äôt scale, and culture alone doesn‚Äôt transform.\n\n**Azure AI Foundry: The Engine Behind Connected Intelligence**\n\nAt the heart of this vision is Microsoft‚Äôs **Azure AI Foundry**, a shared AI platform designed to scale intelligence across the enterprise and a core component of Microsoft‚Äôs recently announced [Network Operations Agent Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/telecommunications/2025/06/12/powering-the-future-of-telecom-microsoft-brings-agentic-ai-to-life-at-tm-forum-dtw/). It integrates:\n\n- **Agent Frameworks** and **Agent Catalogs** for modular AI deployment\n- **700+ TB of daily data** from network switches, device logs, and location records\n- **Enterprise-grade orchestration** and **data governance**\n- **AI/ML models** aligned with customer-level time series events\n\nThis architecture enables reuse, speed, and alignment across people, organizations, and systems‚Äîturning data into actionable intelligence.\n\n**Model Context Protocol (MCP): AI-to-AI Collaboration**\n\nA standout innovation is the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, which goes beyond traditional APIs. While APIs connect systems through data, MCP connects **intelligence through context**. It allows AI agents to dynamically discover and chain APIs without custom coding, enabling real-time collaboration across network operations, device management, and deployment workflows.\n\nBy integrating MCP into the API fabric, Microsoft is laying the groundwork for **agentic AI**‚Äîwhere intelligent systems can autonomously interact, adapt, and scale across the telco ecosystem.\n\n## From Hype to Impact: Operationalizing AI in Telco with TM Forum‚Äôs ODA and Open APIs\n\nThe telecom industry is moving from hype to impact by operationalizing AI through TM Forum‚Äôs Open Digital Architecture (ODA) and Open APIs. The session, ***From hype to impact: operationalizing AI in telco with TM Forum‚Äôs ODA and Open APIs***, explores how telcos can build AI-ready architectures, unlock data value for automation and AI agents, and scale responsibly with governance and ethics at the core.\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs collaboration with TM Forum is enabling telcos to modernize OSS/BSS systems using the ODA Canvas‚Äîa modular, cloud-native execution environment orchestrated with AI and powered by Microsoft Azure. This architecture supports plug-and-play integration of differentiated services, reduces integration costs by over 30%, and boosts developer productivity by more than 40% with GitHub Copilot.\n\nLearn how leading telcos like [Telstra](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1740058425924206437-telstra-telecommunications-azure-openai-service) are scaling AI solutions such as ‚ÄúOne Sentence Summary‚Äù and ‚ÄúAsk Telstra‚Äù across their contact centers and retail teams. These solutions, built on Azure AI Foundry, have delivered measurable impact: 90% of employees reported time savings and increased effectiveness, with a 20% reduction in follow-up contacts. Telstra‚Äôs success is underpinned by a modernized data ecosystem and strong governance frameworks that ensure ethical and secure AI deployment.\n\n## Accelerating TM Forum Open API Development with GitHub Copilot\n\nAs the telecom industry embraces open standards and modular architectures, Microsoft is empowering developers to move faster and smarter with **GitHub Copilot**‚Äîan AI-powered coding assistant that‚Äôs transforming how TM Forum (TMF) Open APIs are built and deployed.\n\n**Why GitHub Copilot for TM Forum Open APIs?**\n\nTMF Open APIs are a cornerstone of interoperability in telecom, offering over 100 standardized RESTful interfaces across domains like customer management, product catalog, and billing. But implementing these APIs can be time-consuming and repetitive.\n\n**GitHub Copilot** streamlines this process by:\n\n- Autocompleting boilerplate code for TMF endpoints\n- Suggesting API handlers and data models aligned with TMF specs\n- Generating test plans and documentation\n- Acting as an AI pair programmer that understands your code context\n\nThis means developers can focus on business logic while Copilot handles the heavy lifting.\n\n**Real-World Uses**\n\nTelco developers benefit from powerful features in GitHub Copilot that streamline the development of TMF Open API services. One such feature is **Agent Mode**, which automates complex, multi-step tasks such as implementing TMF API flows, running tests, and correcting errors‚Äîsaving developers significant time and effort. Another key capability is **Copilot Chat**, which provides conversational support directly within the IDE, helping developers debug code, validate against TMF specifications, and follow best practices with ease. Together, these tools enhance productivity and reduce friction in building compliant, scalable telecom solutions.\n\nFor example, when building a **Customer Management** microservice using the TMF629 API, Copilot can suggest endpoint handlers, validate field names against the spec, and even help write README documentation or unit tests.\n\n**üìà Proven Productivity Gains**\n\nCSPs like [**Proximus**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/transforming-telecommunications-generative-ai-proximus-rick-lievano-6lkze/) have reported significant productivity improvements using GitHub Copilot in their Network IT functions:\n\n- 20‚Äì30% faster code writing\n- 25‚Äì35% faster refactoring\n- 80‚Äì90% improvement in documentation\n- 40‚Äì50% gains in code compliance\n\nOther telcos like **Vodafone**, **NOS**, **Orange**, **TELUS**, and **Lumen Technologies** are also leveraging Copilot to accelerate innovation and reduce development friction.\n\n**Best Practices for TMF API Projects**\n\nTo get the most out of Copilot:\n\n- Use it for repetitive tasks and pattern recognition\n- Always validate generated code against TMF specs\n- Keep relevant spec files open to improve suggestion accuracy\n- Use Copilot Chat for guidance on security, error handling, and optimization\n\nGitHub Copilot is more than a coding assistant‚Äîit‚Äôs a catalyst for telco transformation. By combining AI with TMF‚Äôs open standards, Microsoft is helping developers build faster, smarter, and more consistently across the telecom ecosystem.\n\n> >\n> Learn more about how to configure and use GitHub Copilot in your own TMF Open API projects in our [latest tech community blog](https://aka.ms/telco/githubcopilot).\n> >\n\n## Microsoft‚Äôs Broader Vision for Telco Transformation\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs contributions reflect a comprehensive strategy to reshape the telecom landscape through scalable intelligence, open collaboration, and developer empowerment.\n\nAt the core of Microsoft‚Äôs vision is the idea that **AI must be connected, contextual, and reusable**. The Azure AI Foundry and Model Context Protocol (MCP) exemplify this approach by enabling telcos to:\n\n- Harness massive volumes of time-series data from networks, devices, and customer interactions\n- Deploy modular AI agents that can collaborate across systems\n- Orchestrate workflows that adapt in real time to changing conditions\n\nThis architecture transforms fragmented data into actionable insights, allowing CSPs to move from reactive operations to proactive intelligence.\n\n## Conclusion: Microsoft‚Äôs Strategic Alignment with TM Forum\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs participation at TM Forum Innovate Americas 2025 reflects a deep commitment to transforming the telecom industry through **AI-first innovation**, **open collaboration**, and **developer empowerment**.\n\nFrom T-Mobile‚Äôs vision for **Connected Intelligence**, to Microsoft‚Äôs roadmap for operationalizing **AI and ODA**, and the developer-centric acceleration enabled by **GitHub Copilot**, Microsoft is helping Communication Service Providers (CSPs) move faster, scale smarter, and deliver better customer experiences.\n\nBy aligning with TM Forum‚Äôs goals‚Äîstandardization, interoperability, and autonomous operations‚ÄîMicrosoft is not just participating in the conversation; it‚Äôs helping lead it.\n\n## üì£ Call to Action\n\nJoin Microsoft and other industry leaders at TM Forum Innovate Americas 2025 to explore the future of telco transformation. Whether you're a strategist, technologist, or developer, this is your opportunity to connect, learn, and shape what‚Äôs next.",
