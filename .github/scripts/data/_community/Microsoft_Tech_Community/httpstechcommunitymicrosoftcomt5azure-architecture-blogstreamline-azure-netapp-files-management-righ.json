Traditional workflows often require extensive portal navigation, manual configuration, and policy management, leading to inefficiencies and context switching. The extension addresses these challenges by enabling **AI-powered automation** through natural language commands, reducing provisioning time from hours to minutes while minimizing errors and improving compliance. Key capabilities include generating production-ready ARM templates, validating resources, and delivering optimization insights—all without leaving the coding environment. **Co-authors:**\n\n- [Prabu Arjunan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabu-arjunan/), Product Manager, NetApp\n- [Sagar Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagav-gupta/), Product Manager, NetApp\n- [Nitya Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitya-gupta-1252904/), Executive Director of Product, NetApp\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn enterprise Azure environments, provisioning storage should fit seamlessly into your development workflow. Yet for many teams, deploying Azure NetApp Files (ANF) requires constantly switching between the IDE and Azure Portal—a manual process that interrupts coding momentum and pulls developers away from strategic work.\n\n***What if you could simplify that experience and complete provisioning in minutes instead of hours?***\n\nThe Azure NetApp Files VS Code Extension brings automation and intelligence directly into your development environment. By reducing manual steps and minimizing context switching, organizations can shorten provisioning time from hours to minutes and lower configuration errors, all while maintaining compliance and optimizing costs through AI-driven insights. This approach helps teams accelerate projects and keep developers focused on building, not navigating portals.\n\n# The Traditional Approach\n\n**Time to Deliver: ~1 Day (8 Hours)**\n\nLet’s look at **\"Aarav,\" a Senior Azure DevOps Engineer**. His task is standard but heavy: provision Azure NetApp Files volumes for a production application including database tiers (Standard service level), app tiers (Flexible service level), and backup storage.\n\nWithout automation, Aarav’s day is consumed by manual overhead:\n\n- **Manual Configuration:** Spending significant time outside the platform—cross-referencing documentation, planning capacity pools, and validating service levels—before even beginning the deployment in the Azure Portal.\n- **Policy Management:** Manually applying snapshot policies and export rules while tracking everything in spreadsheets, increasing the risk of error.\n- **Final Validation:** Running connectivity tests that often reveal configuration drift, requiring him to troubleshoot typos or missing assignments before deployment.\n\n**The Real Cost:** High error rates, configuration drift, and \"context switching\" that impacts engineering focus.\n\n# The Modern Approach\n\n**Time to Deliver: ~30 Minutes**\n\nWith the **Azure NetApp Files VS Code Extension**, Aarav stays in his IDE, shifting his workflow from manual clicking to streamlined coding. At the heart of this experience is **@anf**, an intelligent chat participant that transforms storage management into a seamless conversation. By interpreting natural language commands, **@anf** empowers developers to instantly generate production-ready ARM templates, inspect critical resource details like capacity and performance tiers, and receive AI-driven optimization recommendations—all without ever leaving the editor. This capability removes the friction of portal navigation, enabling teams to provision, validate, and optimize enterprise-grade storage with the speed and precision of simple text prompts.\n\n## Step 1: Generate Infrastructure (10 Minutes)\n\nAarav doesn't write JSON from scratch. He opens GitHub Copilot chat in VS Code and types:\n\n***@anf generate ARM template for production volumes with premium SKU for database***\n\nThe AI assistant instantly generates a validated, production-ready ARM template with correctly configured capacity pools and volumes.\n\n## Step 2: Instant Validation (10 Minutes)\n\nOnce deployed, there is no need to hunt through portal tabs to verify the setup. Aarav simply asks:\n\n***@anf what is this volume***\n\nThe extension returns comprehensive details on size, tier, and active policies directly in the editor.\n\n## Step 3: Optimization & Insights (5 Minutes)\n\nTo ensure long-term efficiency, Aarav runs an AI analysis on the new resources:\n\n***@anf analyze this volume***\n\nThe extension provides immediate feedback on **performance optimization**, **cost efficiency**, and **capacity planning**.\n\n# Key Capabilities\n\nThe extension provides three core AI-powered commands that cover the entire lifecycle:\n\n| **Command** | **Function** | **Business Value** | | --- | --- | --- | | **@anf generate ARM template** | Creates production-ready ARM templates for volumes and capacity pools. | Eliminates manual writing; ensures IaC best practices. | | **@anf what is this volume** | Retrieves resource details (size, tier, performance). | Reduces portal visits and context switching. | | **@anf analyze this volume** | AI analysis of cost and performance. | Drives continuous improvement and cost savings. |\n\n# The ROI: Why This Matters\n\nShifting from portal-driven workflows to AI-guided, code-first provisioning delivers measurable impact.\n\n## Efficiency Gains\n\n| **Metric** | **Before (Manual)** | **After (AI-Assisted)** | **Improvement** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Time to Provision** | 8 Hours | 30 Minutes | **93% Faster** | | **Context Switches** | 15–20 Portal Visits | 0–1 Visit | **Higher Focus** | | **Configuration** | 30+ Manual Clicks | 1 Command | **Lower Risk** |\n\n# Summary\n\nFor Azure-focused teams, this extension simplifies infrastructure management, reduces risk, and accelerates delivery—all without leaving your coding environment. It’s a practical way to keep developers productive and projects on track. The VS Code Extension is essentially your “Azure NetApp Files *Storage Copilot for Code”*!\n\n# Ready to Start?
