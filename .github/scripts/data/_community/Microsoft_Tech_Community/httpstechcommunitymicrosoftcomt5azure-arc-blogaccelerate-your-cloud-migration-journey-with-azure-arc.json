Today, we’re excited to announce a new **preview capability** that extends this value: **Azure Migrate’s Arc-based discovery**—designed to accelerate your migration decision-making and planning without additional on-premises deployments.\n\n**What’s New:**\n\nWith **Arc-based discovery**, you can leverage your existing Arc-enabled servers and Arc-enabled SQL Server instances to quickly gain insights into:\n\n- **Migration readiness** for Azure targets such as Azure VMs, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Managed Instance.\n- **Savings potential** for different migration strategies—all without deploying new on-premises infrastructure.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nGetting started is simple:\n\n1. **From Azure Arc Center, create a migration project**.\n2. **Scope your Arc-enabled resources by subscription**.\nThat’s it—no extra on-premises setup required.\n\nAzure Migrate uses data already collected by Arc to:\n\n- Generate **default business cases** comparing your current on-premises TCO with Azure.\n- Provide **full-estate migration readiness assessments** for supported Azure targets\n\nAzure Migrate business case automatically identifies the best savings options for using Azure such as Reserved Instances, Azure Hybrid Use Benefits as well as Extended Security Updates for EOL. It also estimates the sustainability impact of migrating your workloads to Azure.\n\nAzure Migrate assessments provide information about readiness of your workloads for Azure targets, identify potential readiness issues, recommend SKUs for Azure targets to help you plan your migration.\n\nIn addition to default business cases and assessments, you can also create custom business cases and assessments.\n\nYou can also optionally deploy the new Azure Migrate Collector VM extension on your Arc machines to collect performance data to get right-sized SKU recommendations in assessments  and more accurate savings in the business case.\n\n### **How to get started:**\n\n- Follow this [quick start guide to create your migration project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/quickstart-evaluate-readiness-savings-for-arc-resources?view=migrate).\n- Review the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-arc-resource-discovery?view=migrate) for full information on the capability, pre-requisites, and current limitations.\n\nWe are excited to bring migration planning capabilities for your Arc resources and are looking forward to your feedback during the preview!\n\nUpdated Nov 14, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[adaptive cloud](/tag/adaptive%20cloud?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[azure arc](/tag/azure%20arc?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[data services](/tag/data%20services?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[hybrid](/tag/hybrid?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[msignite](/tag/msignite?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[servers](/tag/servers?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[update](/tag/update?nodeId=board%3AAzureArcBlog)\n\n[!\\[snehith&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMDM1ODAtMjU4MDJpQzREMzZFQkYxQURBNkIwNw?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/snehith/103580) [snehith](/users/snehith/103580) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined December 18, 2017\n\n[View Profile](/users/snehith/103580)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurearcblog [Azure Arc Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurearcblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
