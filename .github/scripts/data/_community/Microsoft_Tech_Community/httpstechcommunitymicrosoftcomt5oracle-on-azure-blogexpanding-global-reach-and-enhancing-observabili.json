  "EnhancedContent": "## Microsoft and Oracle are excited to announce expanded regional availability in Germany North and introduce enhanced observability for Oracle Exadata VM Clusters and Oracle Exadata Infrastructure on Oracle Database@Azure.\n\nThis blog is co-authored with Jeni Mattson, Principal Product Manager, Exadata and Database Cloud Product Management\n\nMicrosoft and Oracle are excited to announce expanded regional availability in Germany North and introduce enhanced observability for Oracle Exadata VM Clusters and Oracle Exadata Infrastructure on Oracle Database@Azure.\n\n**Oracle Database@Azure expands to Germany North – now available in 23 regions worldwide**\n\nOracle Database@Azure is rapidly expanding its global presence. Now available in Germany North, we’re bringing Oracle Database@Azure closer to customers around the world — helping meet data residency needs, reduce latency, and boost resiliency.\n\nOracle Database@Azure is now available in 23 Azure regions globally – the most of any hyperscaler. The full list of supported regions includes: Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Canada Central, Central India, Central US, East US, East US 2, France Central, Germany North, Germany West Central, Italy North, Japan East, Japan West, North Europe, Southeast Asia, South Central US, Sweden Central, UK South, UK West, West US, West US2 and West US3.\n\nOracle Database@Azure will expand to 10 more regions by the end of 2025, further enhancing global scalability and resilience.\n\n**Enhanced observability for Oracle Exadata on Oracle Database@Azure**\n\nExadata customers using Oracle Database@Azure now have more ways to monitor and manage their environment with enhanced observability for Exadata logs and events with Azure Monitor and Microsoft Sentinel. This new capability provides  deeper visibility into system behavior such as patching, failures, and cluster changes— directly in the Azure Portal.\n\nWith native log observability in the Azure Portal, organizations can monitor both Exadata VM Clusters and Exadata Infrastructure at the same time. This expands operational visibility and brings Exadata environments into alignment with Azure’s monitoring and security ecosystem.\n\nConsolidating operational and database logs within Azure Monitor and Microsoft Sentinel provides end-to-end visibility into system health, performance, and user activity, strengthens security through advanced threat detection and compliance monitoring while streamlining operations with faster troubleshooting and proactive issue resolution across hybrid cloud environments.\n\nWith the growing complexity of hybrid cloud environments, centralized observability is increasingly important. This new capability allows organizations to:\n\n- Centralize monitoring for a unified, real time view of logs from Azure services and Oracle databases Correlate logs across Azure and Oracle services  for simplified, proactive troubleshooting and root cause analysis. Query logs using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics and set proactive alerts for critical events. Automate incident response and remediation.\n\n- Customize dashboards and reports with deep log analysis and advanced querying capabilities with Kusto Query Language\n\n- Integrate seamlessly with Azure services like Azure Security Center for threat detection and Microsoft Sentinel for SEIM and SOAR capabilities\n\n- Support compliance and auditing  by retaining logs and tracking changes and access with Azure policy\n\n**Supported Log Types :**\n\n- Exadata VM cluster Life Cycle Management Logs\n\n- Exadata Database logs\n\n- Exadata Infrastructure Logs\n\n- Exadata Data Guard logs\n\n**Getting Started**\n\nTo get started, you can enable this feature in the Azure Portal, configure settings, integrate with partner solutions, and set up Microsoft Sentinel. Learn more in our [detailed set up guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/oracle-exadata-database-dedicated-infrastructure-logs?branch=main&amp;branchFallbackFrom=pr-en-us-304189).\n\n**Learn More**\n\n- [Azure Monitor Logs - Azure Monitor | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-platform-logs)\n\n- [Log Analytics workspace overview - Azure Monitor | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview)\n\n- [Onboard to Microsoft Sentinel | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/quickstart-onboard?tabs=defender-portal)\n\nUpdated Aug 14, 2025\n\nVersion 5.0\n\n[oracle database@azure](/tag/oracle%20database%40azure?nodeId=board%3AOracleonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[bhbandam&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-6.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/bhbandam/866953) [bhbandam](/users/bhbandam/866953) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined November 12, 2020\n\n[View Profile](/users/bhbandam/866953)\n\n/category/azure/blog/oracleonazureblog [Oracle on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/oracleonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
