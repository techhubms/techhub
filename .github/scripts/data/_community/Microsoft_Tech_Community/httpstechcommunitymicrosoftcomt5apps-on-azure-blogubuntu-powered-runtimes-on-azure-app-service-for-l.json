  "EnhancedContent": "We’re updating the OS foundation for **new code-based stacks** on Azure App Service for Linux. Every new major version of our supported stacks will target Ubuntu going forward - this includes the new versions for **.NET 10, Python 3.14, Node 24, PHP 8.5** and **Java 25** - all expected to rollout in the next couple of months. Existing stacks remain on Debian, and **nothing changes for your current apps** unless you choose to move.\n\n## Why Ubuntu?\n\nBecause we manage the OS for you, this change is about platform gains that quietly benefit your apps without adding work for your teams.\n\n- **Builds on Debian’s ecosystem:** Ubuntu inherits Debian’s rich package universe while moving faster upstream. This lets the platform adopt newer toolchains and libraries more predictably, improving compatibility and unblocking modern dependencies.\n- **LTS stability with long runway:** Ubuntu LTS follows a 5-year support lifecycle giving us a stable, well-maintained base to operate at scale.\n\n## What’s changing (and what isn’t)\n\n- **Changing:** New **.NET 10, Python 3.14, Node 24, PHP 8.5** and **Java 25** code-based stacks will run on **Ubuntu** images.\n- **Not changing:** Your **existing apps stay on Debian**. No forced migrations.\n- **Operational parity:** Deployment flows (Oryx, GitHub Actions, Azure CLI), scaling, diagnostics, and networking continue to work as before.\n\n## What this means for you\n\n- **No action required** for existing apps.\n- When creating a **new** app or upgrading to **.NET 10, Python 3.14, Node 24, PHP 8.5** and **Java 25**, you’ll get the Ubuntu-based stack by default.\n- When upgrading, verify any native packages your app installs at build/start, since Ubuntu often provides equal or newer versions and names may differ.\n\n## Quick FAQ\n\n**Do I need to move now?** No. Existing apps stay on Debian. Migrate only if you want the newer runtimes and platform improvements.\n\n**Will my build behavior change?** Expected to be neutral-to-positive. Leaner images and fresher toolchains can reduce build and cold-start times.\n\n**Any breaking differences?** None anticipated for supported frameworks. If you pin specific distro package versions, confirm availability on Ubuntu during upgrade.\n\nBy standardizing new stacks on **Ubuntu LTS**, we preserve Debian’s strengths while unlocking a faster cadence, long-term security coverage, and leaner images that translate to better reliability and performance—delivered transparently by the platform.\n\nPublished Oct 30, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure app service](/tag/azure%20app%20service?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[TulikaC&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/tulikac/1661700) [TulikaC](/users/tulikac/1661700) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined December 21, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/tulikac/1661700)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
