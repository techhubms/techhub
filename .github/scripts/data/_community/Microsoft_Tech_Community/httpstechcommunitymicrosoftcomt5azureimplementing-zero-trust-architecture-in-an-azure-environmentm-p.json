  "Description": "In today’s cloud-driven world, the traditional “trust but verify” security model no longer works. The rise of remote work, hybrid networks, and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats means that organizations can’t rely solely on firewalls or network perimeters to protect their assets. Instead, **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)** has become the gold standard for securing modern cloud environments — especially on platforms like **Microsoft Azure**.\n\nThis article explores the principles of Zero Trust, why it matters, and how to implement it effectively in an **Azure environment**.\n\n[https://dellenny.com/implementing-zero-trust-architecture-in-an-azure-environment/](https://dellenny.com/implementing-zero-trust-architecture-in-an-azure-environment/)",
