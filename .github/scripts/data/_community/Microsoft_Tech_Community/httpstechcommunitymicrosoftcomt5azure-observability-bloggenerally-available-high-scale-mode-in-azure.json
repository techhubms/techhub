High scale mode is ideal for customers approaching or above 10,000 logs/sec from a single node.\n\nWhen High Scale mode is enabled, Container Insights does multiple configuration changes leading to a higher overall throughput. These include using a more powerful agent setup, using a different data pipeline, allocating more memory for the agent, and more. All these changes are made in the background by the service and do not require input or configuration from customers.  High Scale mode impacts only the data collection layer (with a new DCR) – the rest of the experience remains the same. Data flows to our existing tables, your queries and alerts work as before too.\n\nHigh Scale mode is available to all customers. Today, High scale is turned off by default. In the future, we plan to enable High Scale mode by default for all customers to reduce the chances of log loss when workloads scale.\n\n**To get started with High Scale mode, please see our documentation at** [https://aka.ms/cihsmode](https://aka.ms/cihsmode)\n\nUpdated Sep 08, 2025\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n[azure kubernetes service](/tag/azure%20kubernetes%20service?nodeId=board%3AAzureObservabilityBlog)\n\n[azure monitor](/tag/azure%20monitor?nodeId=board%3AAzureObservabilityBlog)\n\n[!\\[DalanMendonca&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS03NjM3NzQtMjYzMDEyaTg3QTgyRkE4OTUzOTg0OUE?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/dalanmendonca/763774) [DalanMendonca](/users/dalanmendonca/763774) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined August 18, 2020\n\n[View Profile](/users/dalanmendonca/763774)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azureobservabilityblog [Azure Observability Blog](/category/azure/blog/azureobservabilityblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
