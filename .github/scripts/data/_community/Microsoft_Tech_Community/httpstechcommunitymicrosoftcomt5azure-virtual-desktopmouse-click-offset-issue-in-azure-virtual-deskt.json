  "EnhancedContent": "We are experiencing a recurring mouse misalignment issue when using the Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) Windows App on several Windows 11 clients. The problem occurs on devices with two external monitors and affects multiple users.\n\nEnvironment\n\nWindows version: 10.0.26200.6899 (Windows 11, 25H2) AVD Windows App: mainly version 2.0.757.0, some clients are on slightly different versions Hardware: Windows 11 PCs with two external monitors Display settings: both monitors at 1920x1080, 100% scaling Mac users (using the AVD app) report no issues\n\nIssue description The visual mouse pointer and the actual click position become misaligned inside the AVD RemoteApp session. For example, clicking on one item may select the item below it.\n\nThis appears to be a rendering or coordinate-mapping issue within AVD when running inside the Windows App.\n\nTemporary workaround Minimizing the AVD window and then maximizing it immediately resolves the issue. This refresh/redraw action realigns the pointer and click coordinates.\n\nQuestions Has anyone else seen mouse click offset issues in the AVD Windows App on Windows 11 25H2 with dual-monitor configurations? Are there known fixes, configuration adjustments, or recommended workarounds beyond the minimize/maximize redraw?",
