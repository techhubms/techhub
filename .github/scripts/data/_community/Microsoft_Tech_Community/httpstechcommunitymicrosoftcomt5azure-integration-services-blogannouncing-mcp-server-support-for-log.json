  "EnhancedContent": "## Agent Loop now includes MCP support—unlocking enterprise data through secure, connector‑driven MCP servers.\n\nAt Ignite, we announced that Agent Loop in Azure Logic Apps Standard now supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling agents to discover and call external tools through an open, standardized interface. This brings powerful, flexible tool extensibility to both conversational and autonomous agents.\n\nMCP support gives agents a common language and secure channel to interact with enterprise systems. By standardizing communication through connector-driven MCP servers, it ensures consistent data exchange, governance, and trust across every agent interaction.\n\nAgent Loop offers three ways to bring MCP tools into your workflows:\n\n- Bring Your Own MCP connector – Point to any external MCP server using its URL and credentials, instantly surfacing its published tools in your agent. An example of this type of MCP Server is using [Logic Apps as an MCP Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/create-mcp-server-api-center) which enables you to dynamically build MCP Servers using Logic Apps connectors.\n\n- Managed MCP connector – Access Azure-hosted MCP servers through the familiar managed connector experience, with shared connections and Azure-managed catalogs. Inside of Logic Apps, there are already a set of managed MCP servers that are ready to use. Popular MCP Servers include:\n- Office 365 Email\n- Office 365 Calendar\n- Salesforce\n- Microsoft Learn\n- Atlassian Jira\n- GitHub\n\n- Custom MCP connector – Build and publish your own OpenAPI-based MCP connector to expose private or tenant-scoped MCP servers. Idea for reusability of MCPs across organization.\n\nManaged and Custom MCP connectors support on-behalf-of (OBO) authentication, allowing agents to call MCP tools using the end user’s identity. This provides user-context-aware, permission-sensitive tool access across your intelligent workflows.\n\n## Demo\n\nTo view how you can setup using MCP Servers inside of Agent Loop, please review the following video.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\nFor additional resources:\n\n- [Agent Loop Calling MCP Servers - Logic Apps Labs](https://aka.ms/agentloop/mcp)\n- [Logic Apps MCP Demos](https://aka.ms/mcp-demos)\n\nUpdated Nov 18, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[ai](/tag/ai?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[logic apps standard](/tag/logic%20apps%20standard?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[KentWeareMSFT&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMzc3NzYzLTM3MDMzN2lBMDQxNzRGQUE3REQ3MjUx?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/kentwearemsft/1377763) [KentWeareMSFT](/users/kentwearemsft/1377763) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined April 30, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/kentwearemsft/1377763)\n\n/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog [Azure Integration Services Blog](/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
