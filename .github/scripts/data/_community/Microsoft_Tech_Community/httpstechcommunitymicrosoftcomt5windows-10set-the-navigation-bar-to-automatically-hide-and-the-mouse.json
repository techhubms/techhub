  "Description": "My computer is set to automatically hide the navigation bar. After leaving the computer on for a long time, when I open an application, the navigation bar remains hidden and does not appear when I move the mouse to the bottom. I can only use the navigation bar again after returning to the desktop. It feels as if the application is covering the navigation bar. This problem can be solved by restarting the computer, but I would like to solve it without restarting.\n\nThank you for your answer.",
