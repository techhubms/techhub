I began my preparation on July 10, 2025, mainly using Microsoft Learn modules, hands-on practice in Azure, and practice questions from SkillCertExams. The practice sets really helped me get familiar with scenario-based questions and time management.\n\nI received my official result on September 30, 2025, and I can say the effort was worth it. My advice: focus on understanding how Azure services connect, take practice tests under timed conditions, and carefully review every mistake. Good luck to everyone.",
