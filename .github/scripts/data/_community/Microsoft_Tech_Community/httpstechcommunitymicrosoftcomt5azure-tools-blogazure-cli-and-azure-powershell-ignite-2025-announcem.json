  "Description": "In 2025, the key investment areas for Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell are quality and security. We have also made significant efforts to improve the overall user experience. Meanwhile, AI remains a central theme.\n\nAt Microsoft Ignite 2025, we are pleased to announce several new features related to these priorities:\n\n- In terms of security: MFA enforcement\n- Azure CLI Upgrade and Python 3.13 Compatibility explanation\n- New feature: Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell -***What-If*** and ***-export bicep*** parameter\n\n## Extending our coverage\n\nWe’ve rolled out significant updates across Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell to enhance functionality:\n\n**Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell Upgrades**\n\n- Services updated: ACR, ACS, AKS, App Config, App Service, ARM, ARO, Backup, Batch, Cloud, Compute, Consumption, Container, Container app, Core, Cosmos DB, Cognitive Services, DMS, Eventhub, HDInsight, Identity, IoT, Key Vault, MySQL, NetAppFiles, Network, Packaging, Profile, RDBMS, Service Fabric, SQL, Storage.\n\n**New Extensions for Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell**\n\n- Extensions added: arize-ai,connectedmachine,containerapp,lambda-test,migrate,neon,pscloud,sftp,site,storage-blob-preview.\n\n**New GA Modules for Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell**\n\n- Modules are now generally available: DeviceRegistry, DataMigration, FirmwareAnalysis,LoadTesting,StorageDiscovery , DataTransfer, ArizeAI, Fabric, StorageAction, Oracle\n\nFor detailed release notes:\n\n- Azure CLI: [https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli)\n- Azure PowerShell:  [https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/release-notes-azureps](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/release-notes-azureps)\n\n## Azure CLI Upgrade and Python 3.13 Compatibility Notes\n\nAzure CLI has been upgraded from version **2.76 to 2.77** primarily to address several security vulnerabilities (CVE), including issues related to remote code execution risks and certificate validation flaws in underlying dependencies, ensuring compliance with the latest security standards.\n\nThis upgrade requires Python to move from **3.12 to 3.13**, which introduces a significant change: Python 3.13 enforces stricter SSL verification rules, causing failures for users running behind proxies that intercept HTTPS traffic. Solution: Update your proxy certificate to comply with strict mode. For instance, Mitmproxy fixed this in version v10.1.2 (reference: *https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/32083#issuecomment-3274196488*).\n\nFor more Python3.13 details, see [What’s New In Python 3.13](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.13.html) .\n\n## Handling Claims Challenges for MFA in Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell\n\nClaims challenges appear when ARM begins enforcing MFA requirements. If a user performs create, update, or delete operations without the necessary MFA claims, ARM rejects the request and returns a claims challenge, indicating that higher-level authentication is required before the API call can proceed. This mechanism is designed to ensure sensitive operations are performed only by users who have completed MFA.\n\nThe challenge arises because Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell can only acquire MFA claims during the login phase, and only if the user’s account is configured to require MFA. Changing this setting affects all services associated with the account, and many customers are reluctant to enable MFA at the account level. As a result, when a claims challenge occurs, Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell cannot automatically trigger MFA in the same way Azure Portal does.\n\n**Azure CLI example:**\n\n> >\n> *az login --tenant \"aaaabbbb-0000-cccc-1111-dddd2222eeee\" --scope \"https://management.core.windows.net//.default\" --claims-challenge \"\"*\n> >\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nAzure CLI[:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mandatory-multifactor-authentication?tabs=dotnet#application-ids-and-urls) [Troubleshooting Azure CLI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/use-azure-cli-successfully-troubleshooting#troubleshooting-multifactor-authentication-mfa)\n\n**Azure PowerShell example:**\n\n> >\n> *Connect-AzAccount -Tenant yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyy -Subscription zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzz -ClaimsChallenge*\n> >\n\nFor more details, see:\n\nAzure PowerShell: [Troubleshooting the Az PowerShell module | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/troubleshooting#troubleshooting-multifactor-authentication-mfa)\n\n## Advanced cloud analysis capabilities, involving capacity insights or forecasting in Azure CLI\n\nWith this update, Azure CLI now uses the latest ARM API version (2022-09-01) for endpoint discovery during cloud registration and updates, replacing the older API versions previously used. This ensures more accurate and up-to-date service endpoints, simplifies the configuration of custom Azure clouds, and improves reliability when retrieving required endpoints. By adopting the new API, Azure CLI stays aligned with the latest Azure platform capabilities, increasing both compatibility and forward-compatibility. As a result, users benefit from more accurate endpoint discovery and improved support for new Azure features and service endpoints as they become available.\n\nFor more details about managing cloud environments in Azure CLI, please refer to the official documentation: [Azure cloud management with the Azure CLI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/manage-clouds-azure-cli)\n\n## Azure PowerShell - Add Pagination Support for 'Invoke-AzRestMethod' via '-Paginate' parameter\n\n**Invoke-AzRest** **Method** is a flexible fallback for calling Azure Management APIs, returning raw HTTP responses from underlying endpoints, but it currently lacks built-in pagination, forcing users to implement custom logic when working with large datasets. Since pagination was not part of the original design, changing the default behavior could break existing scripts that depend on the current response format and ***nextLink*** handling. To address this without disruption, we plan to introduce pagination as an optional opt-in feature, enabling users to retrieve complete datasets through server-driven pagination without writing custom code while preserving the current behavior by default for full backward compatibility.\n\nFor more details, see the official documentation for **Invoke-AzRestMethod**: [Invoke-AzRestMethod (Az.Accounts) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.accounts/invoke-azrestmethod)\n\n## Introducing Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell -***What-If*** and ***-export bicep*** parameter\n\nWe’re introducing two new features in both Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell: the *What-If* and *Export Bicep* parameters. The *What-If* parameter gives you an intelligent preview of which resources will be created, updated, or deleted before a command runs, helping you catch issues early and avoid unexpected changes. The *Export Bicep* parameter generates the corresponding Bicep templates to streamline your infrastructure-as-code workflows. Both features leverage AI to assist with command interpretation and template generation. If you’d like to try these capabilities in Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell, you can sign up through our [form](https://aka.ms/PreviewSignupPSCLI).\n\nPlease stay tuned for more updates.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nThe latest breaking change guidance documents can be found at the links below. To read more about the breaking changes migration guide, ensure your environment is ready to install the newest version of Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.\n\nAzure CLI: [Release notes & updates – Azure CLI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/release-notes-azure-cli)\n\nAzure PowerShell: [Migration guide for Az 15.0.0 | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/migrate-az-15.0.0)\n\nMilestone timelines:\n\n[Azure CLI Milestones](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/milestones)\n\n[Azure PowerShell Milestones](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/milestones)\n\nThank you for using the Azure command-line tools. We look forward to continuing to improve your experience. We hope you enjoy Ignite and all the great work released this week.
