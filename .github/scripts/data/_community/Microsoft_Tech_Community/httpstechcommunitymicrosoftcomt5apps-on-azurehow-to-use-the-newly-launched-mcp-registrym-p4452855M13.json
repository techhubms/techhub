  "Description": "The newly launched Model Context Protocol (MCP) Registry in preview is as an open catalog for publicly available MCP servers. This is key in providing discoverability of MCP servers and standardization of this process. The Registry serves as a source of truth for MCP Servers and has also published a process for adding MCP servers. The MCP Registry also allows to register public and private sub-registries. This is an interesting addition and bears some semblance to DNS in its design. The public sub-registry can be likened to a MCP marketplace for servers while a private sub-registry would be suitable for enterprises with stricter privacy and security requirements.\n\n![]()MCP Registry tracks MCP Servers\n\n##### **Accessing Data**\n\nThe Registry data can be accessed through the API provided.
