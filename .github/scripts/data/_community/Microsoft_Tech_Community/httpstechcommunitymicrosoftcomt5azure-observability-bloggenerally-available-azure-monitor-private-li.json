  "Description": "##### Introduction\n\nWe are excited to announce the **General Availability (GA)** of **Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) scale limit increase**, delivering **10x scalability improvements** compared to previous limits. This enhancement empowers customers to securely connect more Azure Monitor resources via Private Link, ensuring **network isolation, compliance, and Zero Trust alignment** for large-scale environments.\n\n##### What is Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)?\n\nAzure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) is a feature that allows you to securely connect Azure Monitor resources to your virtual network using private endpoints. This ensures that your monitoring data is accessed only through authorized private networks, preventing data exfiltration and keeping all traffic inside the Azure backbone network.\n\n##### AMPLS – Scale Limits Increased by 10x in Public Cloud & Sovereign Cloud (Fairfax/Mooncake) - Regions\n\nIn a groundbreaking development, we are excited to share that the scale limits for Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) have been significantly increased by tenfold (10x) in Public & Sovereign Cloud regions as part of the General Availability! This substantial enhancement empowers our customers to manage their resources more efficiently and securely with private links using AMPLS, ensuring that workload logs are routed via the Microsoft backbone network.\n\n![]()AMPLS - Scale Limit Increase - End-to-End Monitoring Telemetry flow\n\n##### What’s New?\n\n- **10x Scale Increase**\n- Connect up to **3,000 Log Analytics workspaces** per AMPLS (previously 300)\n- Connect up to **10,000 Application Insights components** per AMPLS (previously 1,000)\n- **20x Resource Connectivity**\n- Each Azure Monitor resource can now connect to **100 AMPLS resources** (previously 5)\n- **Enhanced UX/UI**\n- Redesigned AMPLS interface supports loading **13,000+ resources** with pagination for smooth navigation\n- **Private Endpoint Support**\n- Each AMPLS object can connect to **10 private endpoints**, ensuring secure telemetry flows\n\n##### Why It Matters\n\nTop Azure Strategic 500 customers, including major Telecom service providers and Banking & Financial Services organizations, have noted that previous AMPLS limits did not adequately support their increasing requirements. The demand for private links has grown 3–5 times over existing capacity, affecting both network isolation and integration of essential workloads. This General Availability release resolves these issues, providing **centralized monitoring at scale** while maintaining robust security and performance.\n\n##### Customer Stories\n\nOur solution now enables customers to scale their Azure Monitor resources significantly, ensuring seamless network configurations and enhanced performance.\n\n##### **Customer B - Case Study: Leading** **Banking & Financial Services Customer**\n\n##### Challenge:\n\nThe Banking Customer faced complexity in delivering personalized insights due to intricate workflows and content systems. They needed a solution that could scale securely while maintaining compliance and performance for business-critical applications.\n\n##### Solution:\n\nThe Banking Customer **** has implemented Microsoft Private Links Services (AMPLS) to enhance the security and performance of financial models for smart finance assistants, leading to greater efficiency and improved client engagement. To ensure secure telemetry flow and compliance, the banking customer implemented **Azure Monitor with Private Link Scope (AMPLS)** and leveraged the **AMPLS Scale Limit Increase** feature.\n\n##### Business Impact:\n\n- Strengthened **security posture** aligned with **Zero Trust principles**\n- Improved **operational efficiency** for monitoring and reporting\n- Delivered a **future-ready architecture** that scales with evolving compliance and performance demands\n\n##### **Customer B - Case Study: Leading Telecom Service Provider - Scaling Secure Monitoring with AMPLS**\n\n##### Architecture:\n\nA Leading Telecom Service Provider employs a highly micro-segmented design where each DevOps team operates in its own workspace to maximize security and isolation.\n\n##### Challenge:\n\nWhile this design strengthens security, it introduces complexity for large-scale monitoring and reporting due to physical and logical limitations on Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS). Previous scale limits made it difficult to centralize telemetry without compromising isolation.\n\n##### Solution:\n\nThe **AMPLS Scale Limit Increase** feature enabled the Telecom Service Provider to expand Azure Monitor resources significantly. Monitoring traffic now routes through Microsoft’s backbone network, reducing data exfiltration risks and supporting Zero Trust principles.\n\n##### Impact & Benefits\n\n- **Scalability:** Supports up to **3,000 Log Analytics workspaces** and **10,000 Application Insights components per AMPLS** (10× increase).\n- **Efficiency:** Each Azure Monitor resource can now connect to **100 AMPLS resources** (20× increase).\n- **Security:** Private connectivity via Microsoft backbone mitigates data exfiltration risks.\n- **Operational Excellence:** Simplifies configuration for 13K+ Azure Monitor resources, reducing overhead for DevOps teams.\n\n##### **Customer Benefits & Results**\n\nOur solution significantly enhances customers’ ability to manage Azure Monitor resources securely and at scale using **Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)**.\n\n##### Key Benefits\n\n- **Massive Scale Increase**\n- **3,000 Log Analytics workspaces** (previously 300)\n- **10,000 Application Insights components** (previously 1,000)\n- Each AMPLS object can now connect to:\n- Azure Monitor resources can now connect with **up to 100 AMPLS resources** (20× increase).\n- **Broader Resource Support**\n- **Data Collection Endpoints (DCE)**\n- **Log Analytics Workspaces (LA WS)**\n- **Application Insights components (AI)**\n- Supported resource types include:\n- **Improved UX/UI**\n- Redesigned AMPLS interface supports loading **13,000+ Azure Monitor resources** with **pagination** for smooth navigation.\n- **Private Endpoint Connectivity**\n- Each AMPLS object can connect to **10 private endpoints**, ensuring secure telemetry flows.\n\n##### **Resources:**\n\nExplore the new capabilities of Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) and see how it can transform your network isolation and resource management.
