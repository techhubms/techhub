With in-place upgrade for Trusted Launch now available, you can instantly boost the protection of your Azure Virtual Machines and Scale Sets—without downtime or complex migrations. Whether you're running Gen1 (BIOS) or Gen2 (UEFI) resources, this upgrade helps you stay ahead of modern threats by enabling foundational security features like Secure boot with minimal effort.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe’re excited to announce that **Trusted Launch in-place upgrade support** is now available to help you strengthen the security of your Azure virtual machines and scale set resources—without the need for complex migrations or rebuilds.\n\n- **Generally available** for existing Gen1 & Gen2 virtual machines (VMs), and for Gen1 & Gen2 VM Uniform scale sets\n- In **private preview** for Gen1 & Gen2 VM Flex scale sets\n\n**Trusted launch** **is strongly recommended by Microsoft** as the secure path from the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) through the Windows kernel Trusted Boot sequence. It helps prevent bootkit malware in the boot process, ensuring your workloads start in a verified and uncompromised state. **Disabling Trusted launch puts your infrastructure at risk of bootkit infections**, making this upgrade not just beneficial—but essential.\n\nBy leveraging [in-place upgrade support](https://aka.ms/TrustedLaunchUpgrade), you can seamlessly enhance foundational security for your **existing** virtual machine and scale set resources with Trusted launch **at no additional cost**, ensuring protection against modern threats and readiness for future compliance needs.\n\n# What is Trusted launch?\n\n**[Trusted Launch](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch)**is a built-in Azure virtual machine and scale set capability that helps protect your virtual machines from advanced threats—right from the moment they start.\n\nIt adds a layer of foundational security to your VMs by enabling:\n\n- **Secure Boot:** Prevents unauthorized code like rootkits and bootkits from loading during startup.\n- **vTPM:** Acts as a secure vault for encryption keys and boot measurements, enabling attestation of your VM’s integrity.\n- **Boot Integrity Monitoring:** Guest attestation extension continuously checks that your VM boots into a trusted, uncompromised state.\n\nTrusted launch security features.\n\nTrusted Launch enhances the security posture of a VM through cryptographic verification and ensures the VM boots to a desired secure state protecting it from attacks that modify operating system processes. This maintains the trust of the guest OS and adds defense-in-depth.

Change the VM size to Trusted launch supported VM size if needed to support the upgrade.\n- VM or Scale set is running [operating system supported with Trusted launch](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch#operating-systems-supported). For Scale set resources, you can change the OS image reference to supported OS version along with Trusted launch upgrade.\n- VM or Scale set is not dependent on Azure [features currently not supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/trusted-launch#unsupported-features) with Trusted launch.\n- Azure Backup, if enabled for VMs, should be configured with [the Enhanced Backup policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-enhanced-policy). Existing Azure VM backup can be [migrated from the Standard to the Enhanced policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-azure-vm-migrate-enhanced-policy).\n- Azure site recovery (ASR), if enabled for VMs, should be [disabled prior to upgrade](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/concepts-trusted-vm#migrate-azure-site-recovery-protected-azure-generation-2-vm-to-trusted-vm). You can re-enable ASR replication post completion of Trusted launch upgrade.\n\n***What are the best practices to consider before upgrade?***\n\nWe recommend following certain best practices before you execute the upgrade to Trusted launch for VMs and Scale set hosting production workloads:\n\n- Review the step-by-step guide published for [Gen1](https://aka.ms/TrustedLaunchUpgrade) and [Gen2](https://aka.ms/TrustedLaunchUpgrade/Gen2VM) VM and [Scale set](https://aka.ms/TrustedLaunchUpgrade/ScaleSet) including known limitations, issues, roll-back steps.\n- Enable Trusted launch on a test VM or Scale set and determine if any changes are required to meet the prerequisites.\n- [Create restore points](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/create-restore-points) for VMs associated with production workloads before you enable the Trusted launch security type. You can use the restore points to re-create the disks and VM with the previous well-known state.\n\n**** ***Can I enable Trusted launch without changing OS from Gen1 (BIOS) to Gen2 (UEFI)?***\n\nTrusted launch security capabilities (Secure boot, vTPM) can be enabled for Gen2 UEFI-based operating system only, it cannot be enabled for Gen1 BIOS-based operating system.\n\n***How will my new or other VMs or Scale set be affected?***\n\nThe upgrade is executed on specific VM or Scale set resource only. It does not impact new or other existing Azure VMs, Scale set clusters already running in your environment.\n\n***Can I roll back Trusted launch upgrade to Gen1 (BIOS) configuration?***\n\nFor virtual machines, you can [roll back the Trusted launch upgrade to Gen2 VM](https://aka.ms/TrustedLaunchUpgrade/Gen2VM#roll-back) without Trusted launch. You cannot in-place roll back from Trusted launch to Gen1 VM.\n\n- For restoring Gen1 configuration, you’ll need to restore entire VM and disks from the backup or restore point of VM taken prior to upgrade.\n- For scale sets, you can roll back the changes made to previous known good configuration including Gen1 configuration.\n\nUpdated Sep 04, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[virtual machines](/tag/virtual%20machines?nodeId=board%3AAzureCompute)\n\n[!\\[AjKundnani&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/ajkundnani/1382620) [AjKundnani](/users/ajkundnani/1382620) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined May 06, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/ajkundnani/1382620)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurecompute [Azure Compute Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurecompute) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
