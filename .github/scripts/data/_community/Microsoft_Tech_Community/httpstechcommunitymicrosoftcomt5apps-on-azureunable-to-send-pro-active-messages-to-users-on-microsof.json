  "Description": "I have built an application to send pro-active messages to users on Microsoft Teams. I am using C# Bot Framework SDK. The application is designed to support users from different tenants [Application Type: multi-tenant] and I have tested the same in the past by installing the app to users belonging to a different tenant than that where the Azure Bot Service is hosted and where the App is registered. Please note that the App doesn't require any API permission but just needs to be installed by the user.\n\nAfter the recent changes made by Microsoft on July 31, 2025, I am no longer able to create an Azure Bot Service having App Type as **multi-tenant**. We plan to publish this application to the Microsoft Teams store. I got to know from the GitHub Issue - [https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/issues/1747](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/issues/1747) that once the application is certified by Microsoft it will be multi-tenant. Therefore, I created the Azure Bot Service and App Registration with App Type as **single-tenant** as **multi-tenant** option was no longer available.\n\nIn the single-tenant configuration, I tested it by installing the application to user belong to the same tenant where the Azure Bot service is hosted and the App is registered. The code started to return an unauthorized exception. Neither I was not able to send out a Welcome Adaptive message card when the Bot application was installed by the user nor I was able to send out a pro-active message to the user.\n\nI had raised a question in the Microsoft Learn Question and Answer Forum and was asked by the Moderator to post it as a thread in the Microsoft Tech Community.\n\nI have mentioned the details in the question along with the attempts that I made to resolve the issue. Kindly go through the details mentioned in the question - [Unable to send pro-active messages to users on Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/5565284/unable-to-send-pro-active-messages-to-users-on-mic)\n\nI’d really appreciate any help or guidance you can provide on resolving this issue. Thank you in advance for your time and support!",
