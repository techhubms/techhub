  "EnhancedContent": "At the company where I work, we purchased a Copilot+ laptop with the hope of being able to use the new Windows AI libraries, such as Windows.AI.TextRecognition. The library works well, but we are unable to process more than 2 documents concurrently, which severely limits our document processing capacity. We also feel misled, as we did not see any mention anywhere of such a limitation regarding the library. I would appreciate it if a Microsoft representative could confirm whether this limitation exists and, if not, let us know if there is any way to increase this limit. Thank you in advance.",
