By doing so, you can establish a comprehensive plan that outlines the specific steps, timelines, and resources required for each wave, ensuring a structured and efficient approach to migration and modernization.\n\nKey aspects of the wave planning in this stage includes:\n\n- **Group and sequence applications and workloads** using tags, dependency analysis, and workload data.\n- **Set Azure targets and migration tools** based on Azure Migrate assessment recommendations.\n- **Outline planning steps, timelines,** and create a wave plan for application migration and modernization.\n\n#### Execution Stage\n\nUsing wave planning you can perform the migration and modernization activities of the application withing the wave, as per the plan and track the progress as workloads are moved, tested, and migrated / modernized in Azure.\n\nKey aspects of wave planning at this stage includes:\n\n- **Centrally track migration and modernization activities** for all applications and workloads within the wave. You can start migrating servers and databases using Server migration and Azure database Migration Service using in-product integrations.\n- **Integrated** **end-to-end workflows** to facilitate server migrations from on-premises environments and various public clouds to Azure Virtual Machines.\n- **Monitor and visualize wave timelines** in relation to planned migration and modernization dates and implement corrective actions as required based on status updates.\n\nIn a nutshell, wave planning transforms migration from a one-time event into a continuous journey of improvement.
