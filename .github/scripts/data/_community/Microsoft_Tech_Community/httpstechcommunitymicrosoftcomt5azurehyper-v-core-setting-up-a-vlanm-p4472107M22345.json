I have tried to find where to create a post under the servers section but I cannot find the create post button in that community. I'm happy for this post to be moved to the correct location.\n\nI have a server running Hyper-V core 2019 of which I remotely connect to from a Windows 10 Pro computer using Hyper-V manager. I have a number of VM and relevant snapshots on it.\n\nI have recently been asked by work to investigate setting up a VLAN on this server to group together 5 VMs on there own private network (hopefully using my existing VMs) with access to the internet. I have searched online on how to do this and in most cases the host Hyper-V server is a full blown OS not a base Hyper-V core. Can anyone guide me on the best source of information on how to setup this requirement? At this time I am imagining that most work has to be done on the command line screen of Hyper-V core via command line entries or PowerShell commands.\n\nIf this is not possible can someone point me to reliable information on how i can upgrade my Hyper-V core  to a full blown OS with a GUI ideally without losing my existing VMs?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRegards,\n\nBarry",
