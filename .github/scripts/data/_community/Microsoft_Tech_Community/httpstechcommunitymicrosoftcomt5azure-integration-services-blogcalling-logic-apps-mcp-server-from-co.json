  "Description": "We recently[released our MCP Server capabilities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/introducing-logic-apps-mcp-servers-public-preview/4450419) in Azure Logic Apps that unlocks enterprise data assets for agentic solutions. One of the questions that I received was, how can I connect to the Logic Apps MCP Server from Copilot Studio. In this post/video, we will describe exactly how to set that up.\n\n##### Why Azure Logic Apps?\n\nAzure Logic Apps provides an enterprise ready solution for building MCP Servers including the following capabilities:\n\n- Strong security posture. Our MCP servers support Entra ID authentication (aka EasyAuth) which provides enterprise authentication and authorization capabilities.\n- Logic Apps (Standard) is a single tenant offering, giving customers dedicated compute, storage and networking.\n- Managed Identity is supported in Logic Apps, allowing you to connect to Azure resources in a secure and efficient manner, without keys or secrets\n- Logic Apps support over 1400 connectors including popular SaaS connectors. But, Logic Apps also has built-in connectors that allow for high-throughput scenarios including on-premises connectivity, without needing an on-premises gateway.\n\n##### Pre-requisites\n\nIn this video, we use the following services:\n\n1. **API Center** - which provides a wizard experience for building our MCP server. It also offers customers with a governance and discoverability surface for organizations looking to scale their MCP offerings. In this video, I used the free tier.\n2. **Logic Apps Standard** - which will provide our MCP capabilities through exposing workflows and connectors as MCP tools.\n3. **Copilot Studio** - which will provide our conversational capabilities and will consume our MCP Server\n\n##### Setup\n\n1. Use API Center to build a Logic Apps MCP Server. **Note:** This can be done without API Center as well, but API Center provides some value-add for customers interested in governance and discoverability.\n2. During this process, an App registration will be created. We need to obtain some values from this App registration and make some minor changes.\n3. Add MCP Server to Copilot Studio.\n4. Use your Copilot Studio agent to call MCP Server.",
