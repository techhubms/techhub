It delivers predictable performance and high reliability with dedicated infrastructure, high throughput, and up to 90-days orchestration data retention. It’s ideal for mission-critical workloads requiring consistent, high-scale throughput and for organizations that prefer predictable billing.\n\nKey features of the Dedicated SKU include:\n\n- **Dedicated Infrastructure:** Runs on dedicated resources guaranteeing isolation.\n- **Custom Scaling:** Configure Capacity Units (CUs) to match your workload needs.\n- **High Availability:** High availability with multi-CU deployments.\n- **Data Retention:** Up to 90 days.\n- Configuring the Durable Task Scheduler during Function App creation. Selecting 3 capacity units.**Performance:** Each CU supports up to 2,000 actions per second and 50GB of orchestration data.\n\n### What’s new in the Dedicated SKU?\n\n#### More Capacity Units\n\nAs of today, the Dedicated SKU enables you to purchase additional capacity units for high performance and orchestration data storage.\n\n#### High Availability\n\nFor applications requiring even higher availability for mission-critical scenarios, the Dedicated SKU now offers a High Availability feature. To enable high availability, you need at least 3 capacity units on your scheduler instance.\n\nLearn more about the Dedicated SKU here: [https://aka.ms/dts-dedicated-sku](https://aka.ms/dts-dedicated-sku)\n\n### Consumption SKU (Public Preview)\n\nWe’ve heard your feedback loud and clear. We understand that the Dedicated SKU isn’t the right fit for every scenario. That’s why we’re introducing a new pricing plan: the Consumption SKU, a SKU tailored for workloads that run intermittently, or scale dynamically, and for requirements where flexibility and cost efficiency matter most.\n\nThe Consumption SKU is perfect for variable workloads and development/test environments. It offers:\n\n- **Pay-Per-Use:** Only pay for actions dispatched\n- **No Upfront Costs:** No minimum commitments.\n- **Data Retention:** Up to 30 days.\n- **Performance:** Up to 500 actions per second.\n\nLearn more about the Consumption SKU here: [https://aka.ms/dts-consumption-sku](https://aka.ms/dts-consumption-sku)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nWe’re excited to reach this milestone, but we also have many plans for the future. Here’s a glimpse of the features you can expect to see in the Durable Task Scheduler in the near future:\n\n- **Private Endpoints**\n- **Zone Redundancy** in the Dedicated SKU\n- **Export API** – Need your orchestration data for longer than the max retention limit? Use the Export API to move data out of DTS into a storage provider of your choice.\n- **Dynamic Scaling of Capacity Units** – Set a minimum and maximum and allow DTS to dynamically scale up and down depending on orchestration throughput.\n- **Ability to handle payloads larger than 1MB**\n\n## Get started with the Durable Task Scheduler today\n\n- **Documentation**: [https://aka.ms/dts-documentation](https://aka.ms/dts-documentation)\n- **Samples**: [https://aka.ms/dts-samples](https://aka.ms/dts-samples)\n- **Getting Started**: [https://aka.ms/dts-getting-started](https://aka.ms/dts-getting-started)\n\nUpdated Nov 19, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure functions](/tag/azure%20functions?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[durable functions](/tag/durable%20functions?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[greenie-msft&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMzk5MjY2LTUyNTIxM2k0OUQzOTZENThENDM5NjVG?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/greenie-msft/1399266) [greenie-msft](/users/greenie-msft/1399266) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined May 24, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/greenie-msft/1399266)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
