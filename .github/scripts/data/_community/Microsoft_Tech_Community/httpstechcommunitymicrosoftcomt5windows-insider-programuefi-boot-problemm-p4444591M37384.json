I am running win 11 with all updates applied and have the latest BIOS (Z490 chipset). If I am running and then restart, everything works fine. If I shutdown and immediately start, it also works (fast boot is on). If I shutdown and then kill the power for a few seconds before starting or if I do something to force a full shutdown, it will give a blue screen saying the BCD is screwed up. I can insert a win 11 USB and choose to repair my computer using automatic repair, it says nothing changed, but a restart will then boot. If I then do a full shutdown again, it is busted again.",
