  "EnhancedContent": "If you’ve been waiting to run Python 3.14 in on Azure App Service - it’s here. Azure App Service for Linux now offers Python 3.14 as a first-class runtime. You can create a new 3.14 app through the Azure portal, automate it with the Azure CLI, or roll it out using your favorite ARM/Bicep templates — and App Service continues to handle the OS, runtime updates, and patching for you so you can stay focused on code.\n\n#### Why Python 3.14 matters\n\n[Python 3.14](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html) (released October 7, 2025) lands with real performance and runtime improvements.\n\n- **Faster under load.** Internal interpreter work reduces overhead in common call paths and improves memory behavior, which can translate to lower latency and less CPU churn in web apps and APIs.\n- **Smarter concurrency.** Python 3.14 continues the rollout of subinterpreters and a free-threaded build (no GIL), making it easier to take advantage of multi-core parallelism for CPU-bound or high-throughput workloads. In 3.14, that free-threaded mode is more mature and shows significantly better multi-threaded performance than earlier releases.\n- **Developer quality-of-life.** You get a more helpful interactive REPL (better highlighting and error hints), cleaner typing through deferred annotations, and new template string syntax (“t-strings”) for safe, structured interpolation.\n\nAll of that is now available to you on App Service for Linux.\n\n#### What you should do next\n\nIf you’re currently running an older Python version on App Service for Linux, this is a good moment to validate on 3.14:\n\n1. Stand up a staging app or deployment slot on Python 3.14.\n2. Run your normal tests and watch request latency, CPU, and memory.\n3. Confirm that any native wheels or pinned dependencies you rely on install and import cleanly.\n\nMost apps will only need minor adjustments — and you’ll walk away with a faster, more capable runtime on a platform that keeps the underlying infrastructure patched and production-ready for you.\n\nPublished Oct 30, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure app service](/tag/azure%20app%20service?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[TulikaC&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/tulikac/1661700) [TulikaC](/users/tulikac/1661700) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined December 21, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/tulikac/1661700)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
