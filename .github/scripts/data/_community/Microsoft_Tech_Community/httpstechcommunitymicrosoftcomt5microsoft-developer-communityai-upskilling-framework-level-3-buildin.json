  "Description": "The [Global AI Community](https://globalai.community/) is excited to bring you the latest updates on **AI Upskilling Framework Level 3 Building**, straight from **Microsoft Ignite**! This session dives deep into advanced concepts for building agentic workflows and showcases new announcements that will help developers accelerate their Agentic AI journey.\n\n## **AI Upskilling Framework**\n\nIn this new era of work, AI skills will be critical for nearly every role. But the level of AI readiness will vary: An entry-level sales representative, seasoned marketing professional, data analyst, and engineer will all need different skills to incorporate AI into their day-to-day work.\n\nIt can be complex to navigate these different use cases; that’s why the LinkedIn Learning team crafted [a five-level framework](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/learning-and-development/new-framework-for-ai-upskilling) with a structured learning model to upskill your organization on AI. They built the framework utilizing insights from LinkedIn’s 1 billion members across 200 regions and countries; consulted LinkedIn Learning instructors who are some of the top AI experts in their field; and validated the model with LinkedIn’s top AI engineering experts across R&D and IT.\n\n## **Level 3 Building - Session Highlights**\n\nIn this session, we start with an introduction to the **AI Upskilling Framework**, setting the stage for Level 3 building and its significance. We then explore the **blueprint and landscape** of agentic workflows, followed by a deep dive into **what an agent is**, why it matters, and the challenges organizations face when adopting this approach. You’ll see practical **use cases** and learn about the **tools** that enable agentic solutions, including a **live demo with Microsoft Foundry**. Next, we introduce the **Microsoft Agentic Framework (MAF)**, comparing traditional workflows with agentic workflows and addressing common issues. To bring these concepts to life, we showcase **two new demos**: a **Claims Intake Workflow** and a **Claims Fraud Detection Workflow**, highlighting how agentic design transforms real-world processes. Finally, we wrap up with a **recap and key takeaways** to help you apply these insights in your own projects.\n\n## **Speakers**\n\n- **Alexander Wachtel -** Microsoft AI MVP & MCT, CEO @ ESC Deutschland GmbH\n- **Jose Luis Latorre Millas -** Microsoft AI MVP, Software Architect @ Swiss Life AG\n- **Carlotta Castelluccio-** Sr AI Advocate @ Microsoft\n\n## **Useful Resources**\n\n- Deep dive into the demo code: ​​[https://aka.ms/multi-agents-sample](https://aka.ms/multi-agents-sample)\n- Learn more on MS Learn [https://aka.ms/ai-agents-fundamentals​](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-fundamentals​) and our OSS AI Agents for beginners course [https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners)\n- Join our online communities to share ideas and experiences: [https://aka.ms/foundrydevs](https://aka.ms/foundrydevs)",
