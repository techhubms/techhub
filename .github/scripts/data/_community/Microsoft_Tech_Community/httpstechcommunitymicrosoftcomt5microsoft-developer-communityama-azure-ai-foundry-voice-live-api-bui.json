From automotive assistants to educational tutors, voice-driven agents are reshaping how we interact with technology. But building seamless, real-time voice experiences has often meant stitching together a patchwork of services: STT, GenAI, TTS, avatars, and more. Until now.\n\n## Introducing [Azure AI Foundry Voice Live API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live)\n\nLaunched into general availability on October 1, 2025, the Azure AI Foundry Voice Live API is a game-changer for developers building voice-enabled agents. It unifies the entire voice stack‚Äîspeech-to-text, generative AI, text-to-speech, avatars, and conversational enhancements, into a single, streamlined interface. That means:\n\n- ‚ö° Lower latency\n- üß† Smarter interactions\n- üõ†Ô∏è Simplified development\n- üìà Scalable deployment\n\nWhether you're prototyping a voice bot for customer support or deploying a full-stack assistant in production, Voice Live API accelerates your journey from idea to impact.\n\n## Ask Me Anything: Deep Dive with the CoreAI Speech Team\n\nJoin us for a live AMA session where you can engage directly with the engineers behind the API:\n\n**üóìÔ∏è Date:** 14th Oct 2025 **üïí Time:** 10am PT **üìç Location:** [https://aka.ms/foundry/discord](https://aka.ms/foundry/discord) See the EVENTS **üé§ Speakers:**\n\n- **Qinying Liao**, Principal Program Manager, CoreAI Speech\n- **Jan Gorgen**, Senior Program Manager, CoreAI Speech\n\nThey‚Äôll walk through real-world use cases, demo the API in action, and answer your toughest questions, from latency optimization to avatar integration.\n\n## Who Should Attend?\n\nThis AMA is designed for:\n\n- AI engineers building multimodal agents\n- Developers integrating voice into enterprise workflows\n- Researchers exploring conversational UX\n- Foundry users looking to scale voice prototypes\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nVoice Live API isn‚Äôt just another endpoint, it‚Äôs a foundation for building natural, responsive, and production-ready voice agents. With Azure AI Foundry‚Äôs orchestration and deployment tools, you can:\n\n- Skip the glue code\n- Focus on experience design\n- Deploy with confidence across platforms\n\n## Bring Your Questions\n\nCurious about latency benchmarks? Want to know how avatars sync with TTS? Wondering how to integrate with your existing Foundry workflows?
