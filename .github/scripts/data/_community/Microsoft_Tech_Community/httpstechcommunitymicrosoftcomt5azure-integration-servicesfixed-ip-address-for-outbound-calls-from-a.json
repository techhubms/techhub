  "EnhancedContent": "Hi,\n\nI recently ran a PoC deployment of Azure APIM Standard V2 Sku instead of our current Premium Classic instance. This worked well! Performance is great and I am able to route calls to an on-prem network ok using vnet-integration. However, one of the features we currently make use of with the Premium Classic instance is a fixed ip address for calls from APIM to 3rd parties.\n\nIs there a way to achieve this using Standard V2? We have tried a nat gateway with fixed ip on the same vnet but this does not seem to help.",
