  "Description": "## Background\n\nFollowing [Red Hat's transition to a scalable vCPU-based pricing model in early 2024](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-enterprise-linux-scalable-pricing-cloud-partners-announcement), Microsoft Azure implemented corresponding pricing updates for RHEL services. As part of ensuring our billing infrastructure fully supports this new pricing structure, we are updating the billing meter IDs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux services to provide better alignment with the current pricing model.\n\n## What's Changing\n\nAs part of optimizing our billing infrastructure to fully support Red Hat's updated pricing model, Microsoft Azure is updating the billing meter IDs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) services. These changes ensure our billing system properly accommodates the vCPU-based pricing structure and Reserved Instance functionality.\n\n**Effective Date:** The meter ID migration will begin rolling out on October 2-8, 2025.\n\n## Impact on Customers\n\n**Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Customers**\n\n- **Billing Continuity:** Your RHEL instances will continue to operate without any service interruption\n- **Meter ID Changes:** New meter IDs will appear in your usage reports and cost management statements starting Oct 2-8, 2025\n- **Usage Tracking:** Historical usage data remains accessible through existing billing reports\n\n## Important: No Pricing Impact\n\n**This meter ID migration has no impact on pricing.** Azure already implemented the RHEL pricing changes in early 2024. This meter ID update is purely a technical billing system change and does not affect your costs in any way. For pricing information, see the [Pricing - Red Hat Virtual Machines | Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/red-hat/?msockid=327195d128156d503710839729c16ccb) page.\n\n## Action Required: Update Your Billing Tools\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted monitoring and reporting, we recommend reviewing and updating the following:\n\n1. **Billing Reports and Dashboards**\n\n- - **Cost Management Reports:** Update any custom reports that filter by specific RHEL meter IDs\n- **Power BI Dashboards:** Refresh data connections and update meter ID filters\n- **Third-party Tools:** Verify that cost management tools recognize the new meter IDs\n\n1. **Budget Alerts and Monitoring**\n\n- - **Budget Configurations:** Review budgets that target specific RHEL services and update meter ID filters\n- **Cost Alerts:** Ensure automated cost alerts include both old and new meter IDs during the transition period\n- **Spending Thresholds:** Update any spending controls that rely on meter ID identification\n\n1. **Automated Tools and Scripts**\n\n- - **Cost Analysis APIs:** Update API calls that reference specific RHEL meter IDs\n- **Automation Scripts:** Modify any scripts that process billing data using meter ID filters\n- **Integration Tools:** Update third-party integrations that rely on meter ID mapping\n\n## Transition Period Support\n\nDuring the migration period, you may see both old and new meter IDs in your statements. This is expected behavior as the transition occurs gradually across different regions and services.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n- **October 2-8, 2025:** New meter IDs begin appearing for RHEL Pay as you go meters\n- **Transition Period:** Both old and new meter IDs may appear in billing during migration\n- **Completion:** Migration will be completed across all regions and services\n\n## Affected RHEL Meters\n\nThe following RHEL meter names will be updated with new meter IDs as part of this migration:\n\n- 1 vCPU VM License\n- 1 vCPU VM License - Free\n- 2 vCPU VM License\n- 4 vCPU VM License\n- 6 vCPU VM License\n- 8 vCPU VM License\n- 12 vCPU VM License\n- 16 vCPU VM License\n- 20 vCPU VM License\n- 24 vCPU VM License\n- 32 vCPU VM License\n- 40 vCPU VM License\n- 44 vCPU VM License\n- 48 vCPU VM License\n- 52-vCPU VM License\n- 60 vCPU VM License\n- 64 vCPU VM License\n- 72 vCPU VM License\n- 80 vCPU VM License\n- 96 vCPU VM License\n- 120 vCPU VM License\n- 128 vCPU VM License\n- 144-vCPU VM License\n- 192 vCPU VM License\n- 192-vCPU VM License\n- 208 vCPU VM License\n- 416 vCPU VM License\n- 420-vCPU VM License\n\nThese meter changes are tied to the vCPU count, not the VM family - meaning any VM with the same vCPU count (whether D family, E family, etc.) uses the same RHEL license meter. For example, all 2 vCPU VMs use the \"2 vCPU VM License\" meter regardless of the VM family.\n\nIf your billing reports, budgets, or automated tools currently filter or reference any of these specific meter names, you'll need to update them to include the new meter IDs once the migration begins.\n\n## Support and Resources\n\n**Need Help?**\n\n- **Azure Support:** Contact [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support) for technical assistance with billing or meter ID questions\n- **Account Team:** Reach out to your Microsoft account team for guidance on updating enterprise billing processes\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n- RHEL pricing update details: [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Pricing update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/linuxandopensourceblog/red-hat-enterprise-linux-pricing-update/4097754)\n- **Azure cost optimization** resources can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/cost-optimization)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: Will this affect my RHEL instances or their performance?** A: No, this is purely a billing system update. Your RHEL instances will continue to operate normally with no performance impact.\n\n**Q: How can I identify the new meter IDs in my billing?** A: New meter IDs will appear in your Cost Management portal and usage reports and cost management statements starting October 2-8, 2025. Watch for updated RHEL service descriptions in your billing details.\n\n**Q: What if my automated tools stop working?** A: Contact Azure Support for assistance. We recommend updating your tools proactively using the meter ID mapping reference provided.\n\nWe're committed to making this transition as smooth as possible. If you have questions or need assistance, please reach out to Azure Support or your Microsoft account team.",
