  "Description": "Azure Logic Apps now supports **cloning existing Consumption Logic Apps into Standard workflows**. This feature simplifies migration by allowing you to reuse your existing workflows without starting from scratch. It’s designed to help organizations transition to the Standard model, which offers improved performance, flexibility, and advanced capabilities.\n\n## Why Does It Matter?\n\nMigrating from Consumption to Standard has been a common challenge for teams looking to modernize their integration solutions. Standard workflows provide:\n\n- **Better performance** through single-tenant architecture.\n- **Enhanced developer experience** with local development and VS Code integration.\n- **Advanced features** like built-in connectors, stateful/stateless workflows, and integration with Azure Functions.\n\nThis new cloning capability reduces friction, accelerates adoption, and ensures continuity for existing business processes. And with the announcement of [Agent Loop Support in Logic Apps Consumption](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/announcing-public-preview-of-agent-loop-in-azure-logic-apps-consumption/4471056), the ability to clone agentic workflows to a Logic Apps Standard application allow you to have a graduation strategy for your agents.\n\n## Key Highlights\n\n- **Direct cloning**: Convert an existing Consumption Logic App into a Standard workflow with minimal manual effort.\n- **Preserves workflow design**: Your triggers, actions, and configurations are carried over.\n- **Supports modernization**: Enables migration to a model that supports advanced features like custom connectors and private endpoints.\n- **Improved governance**: Standard workflows allow better control over deployment and scaling.\n\n## How to Get Started\n\n1. Navigate to your **Consumption Logic App** in the Azure portal.\n2. Select **Clone to Standard** from the available options.\n3. Choose the target **Logic App (Standard)** environment and configure settings.\n4. Validate and deploy the cloned workflow.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- **Infrastructure settings aren’t cloned** (e.g., integration account configurations).\n- **Connections and credentials must be reconfigured** after cloning.\n- **Secure parameters aren’t copied**; placeholders are created and need updating from Key Vault.\n- **Connectors default to shared** even if built-in versions exist.\n- **Unsupported items**include:\n- Integration account references\n- XML/Flat file transformations\n- EDIFACT and X12 actions\n- Nested workflows\n- Azure Function calls\n\n## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about this new feature, check the [official documentation](https://aka.ms/clonetostandard/docs) on Microsoft Docs.",
