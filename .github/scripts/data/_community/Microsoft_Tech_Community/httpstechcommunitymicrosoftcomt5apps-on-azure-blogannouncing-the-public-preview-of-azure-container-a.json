  "Description": "We’re thrilled to announce the public preview of Azure Container Apps Azure Monitor Dashboards with Grafana, a major step forward in simplifying observability for your apps and environments. With this new integration, you can view Grafana dashboards directly within your app or environment in the Azure portal, with no extra setup or cost required.\n\n#### **What’s new?**\n\nAzure Monitor Dashboards with Grafana bring the power of Grafana’s visualization capabilities to your Azure resources. Dashboards with Grafana enable you to create and edit Grafana dashboards directly in the Azure portal without additional cost and less administrative overhead compared to self-hosting Grafana or using managed Grafana services.\n\nFor Azure Container Apps, this means you can access two new pre-built dashboards:\n\n- Container App View: View key metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, request rates, replica restarts, and more.\n- Environment View: See all your apps in one view with details like latest revision name, minimum and maximum replicas, CPU and memory allocations, and more for each app.\n\nThese dashboards are designed to help you quickly identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure your applications are running smoothly.\n\n#### **Benefits**\n\n- Drill into key metrics: Stop switching between multiple tools or building dashboards from scratch. Start from the environment dashboard to get a high-level view of all of your apps, then drill into individual app dashboards.\n\n- Customize your views: Tailor the dashboards to your team’s needs using Grafana’s flexible visualization options.\n\n- Full compatibility with open-source Grafana: Dashboards created in Azure Monitor are portable across any Grafana instance.\n\n- Share dashboards across your team with Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Dashboards are native Azure resources, so you can securely share them using RBAC.\n\n#### **Get started today**\n\nFor Azure Container Apps, you can experience these dashboards directly from either your environment or an individual app:\n\n1. Navigate to your Azure Container App environment or a specific Container App in the Azure portal.\n\n1. Open the Monitoring section and select the “Dashboards with Grafana (Preview)” blade.\n\n1. View your metrics or customize the dashboard to meet your needs.\n\nFor detailed guidance, see aka.ms/aca/grafana\n\n##### **Want more? Explore the Grafana Gallery**\n\nLooking for additional customization or inspiration? Visit the [Grafana Dashboard Gallery](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) to explore thousands of community dashboards.\n\nIf you prefer to use Azure Managed Grafana, here are direct links to Azure Container Apps templates:\n\n[Azure / Container Apps / Container App View](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16592-azure-container-apps-container-app-view/)\n\n[Azure / Container Apps / Aggregate View](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/16591-azure-container-apps-aggregate-view/)\n\nYou can also view other published Azure dashboards [here](https://grafana.com/orgs/azure/dashboards).",
