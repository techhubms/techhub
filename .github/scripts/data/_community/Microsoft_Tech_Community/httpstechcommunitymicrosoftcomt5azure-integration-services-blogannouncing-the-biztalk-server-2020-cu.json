  "Description": "The BizTalk Server product team has released the Cumulative Update 7 for BizTalk Server 2020.\n\nThe Cumulative Update 7 contains all released functional and security fixes for customer-reported issues for BizTalk Server 2020. Also, CU7 includes support for the following new Microsoft platforms:\n\n- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022\n- Microsoft Windows Server 2022\n- Microsoft SQL Server 2022\n- Microsoft Windows 11\n\nBizTalk Server 2016 is currently out of support with its end of life in 2027. If you are running BizTalk 2016, or earlier versions of the product, you must upgrade to BizTalk Server 2020 CU6 or strongly consider migrating to Azure Logic Apps. Please fill this survey: [https://aka.ms/biztalklogicapps](https://aka.ms/biztalklogicapps).\n\nMore Information about the CU7:\n\n- This is an optional update only if you require VS 2022. If you don’t need VS2022, you can continue running on BizTalk Server CU6.\n- CU7 requires that you re-create BizTalk groups for BizTalk Server instances that already were part of a BizTalk group before the installation.\n- Existing BizTalk groups can't have different instances at different cumulative update level.\n- We will provide support to our CU6 and CU7 customers.\n\nYou can obtain the software from the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339) or the [Visual Studio Subscriber](https://my.visualstudio.com/) site. For more information about the BizTalk Server 2020 CU7, read the Microsoft Knowledgebase article posted to [https://aka.ms/BTS2020CU7KB](https://aka.ms/BTS2020CU7KB)\n\n.",
