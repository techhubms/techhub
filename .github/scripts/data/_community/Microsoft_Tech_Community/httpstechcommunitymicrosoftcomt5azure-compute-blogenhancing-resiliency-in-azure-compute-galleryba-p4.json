  "Description": "In today's cloud-driven world, ensuring the resiliency and recoverability of critical resources is top of mind for organizations of all sizes. Azure Compute Gallery (ACG) continues to evolve, introducing robust features that safeguard your virtual machine (VM) images and application artifacts. In this blog post, we'll explore two key resiliency innovations: the new Soft Delete feature (currently in preview) and Zonal Redundant Storage (ZRS) as the default storage type for image versions. Together, these features significantly reduce the risk of data loss and improve business continuity for Azure users.\n\n## The Soft Delete Feature in Preview: A safety net for your Images\n\nMany Azure customers have struggled with accidental deletion of VM images, which disrupts workflows and causes data loss without any way to recover, often requiring users to rebuild images from scratch. Previously, removing an image from the Azure Compute Gallery was permanent and resulted in customer dissatisfaction due to service disruption and lengthy process of recreating the image. Now, with Soft Delete (currently available in public preview), Azure introduces a safeguard that makes it easy to recover deleted images within a specified retention period.\n\n### How Soft Delete Works\n\nWhen Soft Delete is enabled on a gallery, deleting an image doesn't immediately remove it from the system. Instead, the image enters a \"soft-deleted\" state, where it remains recoverable for up to 7 days. During this grace period, administrators can review and restore images that may have been deleted by mistake, preventing permanent loss. After the retention period expires, the platform automatically performs a hard (permanent) delete, at which point recovery is no longer possible.\n\n### Key Capabilities and User Experience\n\n- Recovery period: Images are retained for a default period of 7 days, giving users time to identify and restore any resources deleted in error.\n- Seamless Recovery: Recover soft-deleted images directly from the Azure Portal or via REST API, making it easy to integrate with automation and CI/CD pipelines.\n- Role-Based Access: Only owners or users with the Compute Gallery Sharing Admin role at the subscription or gallery level can manage soft-deleted images, ensuring tight control over recovery and deletion operations.\n- No Additional Cost: The Soft Delete feature is provided at no extra charge. After deletion, only one replica per region is retained, and standard storage charges apply until the image is permanently deleted.\n- Comprehensive Support: Soft Delete is available for Private, Direct Shared, and Community Galleries. New and existing galleries can be configured to support the feature.\n\nTo enable Soft Delete, you can update your gallery settings via the Azure Portal or use the Azure CLI. Once enabled, the \"delete\" operation will soft-delete images, and you can view, list, restore, or permanently remove these images as needed.\n\nLearn more about Soft Delete feature at [https://aka.ms/sigsoftdelete](https://aka.ms/sigsoftdelete)\n\n## Zonal Redundant Storage (ZRS) by Default\n\nAnother major resiliency enhancement in Azure Compute Gallery is the default use of Zonal Redundant Storage (ZRS) for image versions. ZRS replicates your images across multiple availability zones within a region, ensuring that your resources remain available even if a zone experiences an outage. By defaulting to ZRS, Azure raises the baseline for image durability and access, reducing the risk of disruptions due to zone-level failures.\n\n- Automatic Redundancy: All new image versions are stored using ZRS by default, without requiring manual configuration.\n- High Availability: Your VM images are protected against the failure of any single availability zone within the region.\n- Simplified Management: Users benefit from resilient storage without the need to explicitly set up or manage storage account redundancy settings.\n\nDefault ZRS capability starts with API version 2025-03-03; Portal/SDK support will be added later.\n\n## Why These Features Matter\n\nThe combination of Soft Delete and ZRS by default provides Azure customers with enhanced operational reliability and data protection. Whether overseeing a suite of VM images for development and testing purposes or coordinating production deployments across multiple teams, these features offer the following benefits:\n\n- Mitigate operational risks associated with accidental deletions or regional outages.\n- Minimize downtime and reduce manual recovery processes.\n- Promote compliance and security through advanced access controls and transparent recovery procedures.\n\nTo evaluate the Soft Delete feature, you may register for the preview and activate it on your galleries through the Azure Portal or RestAPI. Please note that, during its preview phase, this capability is recommended for assessment and testing rather than for production environments. ZRS is already available out-of-the-box, delivering image availability starting with API version 2025-03-03.\n\nFor comprehensive details and step-by-step guidance on enabling and utilizing Soft Delete, please review the public specification document at [https://aka.ms/sigsoftdelete](https://aka.ms/sigsoftdelete)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAzure Compute Gallery continues to push the envelope on resource resiliency. With Soft Delete (preview) offering a reliable recovery mechanism for deleted images, and ZRS by default protecting your assets against zonal failures, Azure empowers you to build and manage VM deployments with peace of mind. Stay tuned for future updates as these features evolve toward general availability.",
