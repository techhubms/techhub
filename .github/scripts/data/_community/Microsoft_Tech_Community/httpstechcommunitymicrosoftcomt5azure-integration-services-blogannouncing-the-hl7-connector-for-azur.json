  "EnhancedContent": "## Connect to Healthcare systems from Azure Logic Apps (Standard and Hybrid)\n\nWe’re excited to announce the Public Preview of the HL7 connector for Azure Logic Apps, empowering healthcare organizations to seamlessly integrate clinical applications and automate data exchange using industry-standard HL7 protocols.\n\n## Why HL7 Integration Matters\n\nHealthcare organizations are complex ecosystems, with departments such as admissions, laboratories, nursing stations, and billing all generating and consuming critical patient data. Efficient, secure, and standardized data exchange is essential for delivering quality care and streamlining operations.\n\n## HL7 Connector: Key Capabilities\n\n- Simplified healthcare application integration with HL7-specific adapters and schemas.\n- Standardized clinical data interchange between diverse medical applications.\n- Automated communication processes to minimize manual intervention.\n- End-to-end business process support for scenarios like admissions, discharge, and transfer, using publisher/subscriber patterns.\n\n## Typical Scenarios\n\n1. End-to-End Integration: Publishers (e.g., Admissions Discharge and Transfer systems) send HL7 messages to subscribers (Hospital Information System, Pharmacy System). Azure Logic Apps processes, validates, reformats, and routes these messages, with acknowledgments sent back to publishers.\n2. Interrogative (Query/Response): Line-of-business applications can query other systems (e.g., requesting lab results from the Hospital Information System), with Azure Logic Apps managing routing and responses.\n\n## HL7 Encode/Decode actions\n\nThe HL7 connector provides native parsing and serialization of HL7 messages. It provides a Decode action that receives an HL7 message to decode in flat file format to produce an XML file, and an Encode action that receives a message to encode, with a header to encode to produce a Flat file.\n\n**Decode**\n\n- **Input**: Flat file HL7 message.\n- **Output**: Decoded XML message content and XML header content.\n\n**Encode**\n\n- **Input**: XML message and header content.\n- **Output**: Encoded HL7 flat file message.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n- HL7 Message Schemas: Supports HL7 v2.X flat-file and XML schemas.\n- Schema Management: Upload BizTalk schemas directly into integration accounts for seamless migration.\n- Hybrid Deployment: Integration accounts connect to Azure.\n- Message Processing: Logic Apps currently supports single message processing, with batching planned for future updates.\n- Multipart Handling: Logic Apps exposes header, body, and custom segments as first-class outputs, simplifying orchestration compared to BizTalk’s multipart pipelines.\n- Connector Availability: HL7 is available for both hybrid and Logic App Standard.\n- Integration accounts: Currently we only support uploading schemas in Integration accounts.\n\n## Announcing MLLP Private Preview\n\nWe’re pleased to announce that MLLP support is now available as a private preview. MLLP Adapter: Enables HL7 messaging over the Minimal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP). MLLP is available only in hybrid due to port restrictions in app services.\n\nCustomers interested in early access and providing feedback can sign up via this survey: [Private bundle for MLLP request](https://aka.ms/privatemllp)\n\n## Get Started\n\nTo learn more about the HL7 connector and how it can transform your healthcare integration workflows, visit our documentation at [Integrate Healthcare Systems with HL7 in Standard Workflows | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/connectors/integrate-healthcare-systems).\n\n### Video explaining the features of the new HL7 connector\n\nUpdated Nov 24, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[integration account](/tag/integration%20account?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[logic apps](/tag/logic%20apps?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[logic apps standard](/tag/logic%20apps%20standard?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[hcamposu&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xNTI0MTY1LTUwOTc2N2lCREVDRDAxQjMxQ0Q3OTM0?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/hcamposu/1524165) [hcamposu](/users/hcamposu/1524165) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined September 16, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/hcamposu/1524165)\n\n/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog [Azure Integration Services Blog](/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
