  "Description": "Today, we’re excited to introduce the Kubernetes Center in the Azure portal, a new experience to simplify how customers manage, monitor, and optimize Azure Kubernetes Services environments at scale. The Kubernetes Center provides a unified view across all clusters, intelligent insights, and streamlined workflows that help platform teams stay in control while enabling developers to move fast.\n\nAs Kubernetes adoption accelerates, many teams face growing challenges in managing clusters and workloads at scale. Getting a quick snapshot of what needs attention across clusters and workloads can quickly become overwhelming. Kubernetes Center is designed to change that, offering a streamlined and intuitive experience that brings everything together in one place, brings the most critical Kubernetes capabilities into a single pane of glass for unified visibility and control.\n\n**What is K** **ubernetes Center?:**\n\n**Actionable insights from the start:** Kubernetes Center surfaces key issues like security vulnerabilities, cluster alerts, compliance gaps, and upgrade recommendations in a single, unified view. This helps teams focus immediately on what matters most, leading to faster resolution times, improved security posture, and greater operational clarity.\n\n**Streamlined management experience:** By bringing together AKS, AKS Automatic, Fleet Manager, and Managed Namespaces into a single experience, we’ve reduced the need to jump between services. Everything you need to manage Kubernetes on Azure is now organized in one consistent interface.\n\n**Centralized Quickstarts:** Whether you’re getting started or troubleshooting advanced scenarios, Kubernetes Center brings relevant documentation, learning resources, and in-context help into one place so you can spend less time searching and more time building.\n\n****\n\n**Azure Portal:**\n\nFrom Distinct landing experiences for AKS, Fleet Manager, and Managed Kubernetes Namespaces:\n\n![]()\n\nTo a streamlined management experience: Get the big picture at a glance, then dive deeper with individual pages designed for effortless discovery.\n\n![]()\n\n****\n\nCentralized Quickstarts:\n\n![]()\n\n**Next Steps:** Build on your momentum by exploring Kubernetes Center. Create your first AKS cluster or deploy your first application using the Deploy Your Application flow and track your progress in real time or Check out the new experience and instantly see your existing clusters in a streamlined management experience. Your feedback will help shape what comes next. Start building today with [Kubernetes Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_KubernetesFleet/KubernetesHub.MenuView/~/overview) on Azure Portal!\n\nLearn more: [Create and Manage Kubernetes resources in the Azure portal with Kubernetes Center (preview) - Azure Kubernetes Service | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-center-azure-portal)\n\n**FAQ:**\n\n1. What products from Azure are included in Kubernetes Center?\nA. Kubernetes Center brings together all your Azure Kubernetes resources such as AKS, AKS Automatic, Fleet Manager, and Managed Namespaces into a single interface for simplified operations. Create new resources or view your existing resources in Kubernetes Center.\n2. Does Kubernetes Center handle multi-cluster management?\nA. Kubernetes Center provides a unified interface aka single pane of glass to view and monitor all your Kubernetes resources in one place. For multi-cluster operations like upgrading Kubernetes Version, placing cluster resources on N clusters, policy management, and coordination across environments, Kubernetes Fleet Manager is the solution designed to handle that complexity at scale. It enables teams to manage clusters at scale with automation, consistency, and operational control.\n3. Does Kubernetes Center provide security and compliance insights?\nA. Absolutely**.** When Microsoft Defender for Containers is enabled, Kubernetes Center surfaces critical security vulnerabilities and compliance gaps across your clusters.\n4. Where can I find help and documentation?\nA. All relevant documentation, QuickStarts, and learning resources are available directly within Kubernetes Center, making it easier to get support without leaving the platform. For more information: [Create and Manage Kubernetes resources in the Azure portal with Kubernetes Center (preview) - Azure Kubernetes Service | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-center-azure-portal)\n5. What is the status of this launch?\nA. [Kubernetes Center](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_KubernetesFleet/KubernetesHub.MenuView/~/overview) is currently in preview, offering core capabilities with more features planned for the general availability release.\n6. What is the roadmap for GA?\nA. Our roadmap includes adding new features and introducing tailored views designed for Admins and Developers. We also plan to enhance support for multi-cluster capabilities in Azure Fleet Manager, enabling smoother and more efficient operations within the Kubernetes Center.",
