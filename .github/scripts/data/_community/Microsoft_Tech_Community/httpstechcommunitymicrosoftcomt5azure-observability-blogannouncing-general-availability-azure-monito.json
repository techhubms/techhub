This service offers a powerful solution for cloud-native monitoring and visualizing all your Azure data.\n\nDashboards with Grafana enable you to create and edit Grafana dashboards directly in the Azure portal without additional cost and less administrative overhead compared to self-hosting Grafana or using managed Grafana services. Built-in Grafana controls and components allow you to apply a rich set of visualization panels and client-side transformations to Azure monitoring data to create custom dashboards.\n\n### Start quickly with pre-built and community dashboards\n\nDozens of pre-built [Grafana dashboards](https://grafana.com/orgs/azure/dashboards) for Azure Kubernetes Services, Application Insights, Storage Accounts, Cosmos DB, Azure PostgreSQL, OpenTelemetry metrics and dozens of other Azure resources are included and enabled by default. Additionally, you can import dashboards from thousands of publicly available [Grafana community and open-source dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/?dataSource=prometheus) for the supported data sources: Prometheus, Azure Monitor (metrics, logs, traces, Azure Resource Graph), and Azure Data Explorer.\n\n### Streamline monitoring with open-source compatibility and Azure enterprise capabilities\n\nAzure Monitor dashboards with Grafana are fully compatible with open-source Grafana dashboards and are portable across any Grafana instances regardless of where they are hosted. Furthermore, dashboards are native Azure resources supporting Azure RBAC to assign permissions, and automation via ARM and Bicep templates.\n\n- Import, edit and create dashboards in 30+ Azure regions\n- Choose from any language in the Azure Portal for your Grafana user interface\n- Manage dashboard content as part of the ARM resource\n- Automatically generate ARM templates to automate deployment and manage dashboards\n\n### Take advantage of Grafana Explore and New Dashboards\n\nLeverage [Grafana Explore](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/get-started-with-explore/) to quickly create ad-hoc queries without modifying dashboards and add queries and visualizations to new or existing dashboards\n\nNew out of the box dashboards for additional Azure resources:\n\n- Additional Azure Kubernetes Service support including AKS Automatic and AKS Arc connected clusters\n- Azure Container Apps monitoring dashboards\n- Microsoft Foundry monitoring dashboards\n- Azure Monitor Application Insights dashboards\n- OpenTelemetry metrics\n- Microsoft Agent Framework\n- High Performance Computing dashboards with dedicated GPU monitoring\n\n### When to step up to Azure Managed Grafana?\n\nIf you store your telemetry data in Azure, Dashboards with Grafana in the Azure portal is a great way to get started with Grafana. If you have additional 3rd-party data sources, or need full enterprise capabilities in Grafana, you can choose to upgrade to [Azure Managed Grafana](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/managed-grafana/overview), a fully managed hosted service for the Grafana Enterprise software.\n\nSee a detailed solution comparison of **Dashboards with Grafana** and **Azure Managed Grafana** [here](https://aka.ms/DashboardsWithGrafanaComparison).\n\n[Get started](https://aka.ms/dashboardswithgrafanadocs) with Azure Monitor dashboards with Grafana today.\n\nUpdated Nov 13, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[application insights](/tag/application%20insights?nodeId=board%3AAzureObservabilityBlog)\n\n[azure kubernetes service](/tag/azure%20kubernetes%20service?nodeId=board%3AAzureObservabilityBlog)\n\n[azure monitor](/tag/azure%20monitor?nodeId=board%3AAzureObservabilityBlog)\n\n[azure monitor managed service for prometheus](/tag/azure%20monitor%20managed%20service%20for%20prometheus?nodeId=board%3AAzureObservabilityBlog)\n\n[opentelemetry](/tag/opentelemetry?nodeId=board%3AAzureObservabilityBlog)\n\n[!\\[KayodePrince&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS03MTA0OTktMjAxODYxaUEyRTA0QjlDNzM5QzBCNkU?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/kayodeprince/710499) [KayodePrince](/users/kayodeprince/710499) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined June 25, 2020\n\n[View Profile](/users/kayodeprince/710499)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azureobservabilityblog [Azure Observability Blog](/category/azure/blog/azureobservabilityblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
