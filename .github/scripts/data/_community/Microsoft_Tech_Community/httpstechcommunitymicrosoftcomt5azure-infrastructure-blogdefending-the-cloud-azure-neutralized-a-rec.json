  "EnhancedContent": "On October 24, 2025, Azure DDOS Protection automatically detected and mitigated a multi-vector DDoS attack measuring 15.72 Tbps and nearly 3.64 billion packets per second (pps). This was the largest DDoS attack ever observed in the cloud and it targeted a single endpoint in Australia.\n\nBy utilizing Azure’s globally distributed DDoS Protection infrastructure and continuous detection capabilities, mitigation measures were initiated. Malicious traffic was effectively filtered and redirected, maintaining uninterrupted service availability for customer workloads.\n\nThe attack originated from Aisuru botnet. Aisuru is a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet that frequently causes record-breaking DDoS attacks by exploiting compromised home routers and cameras, mainly in residential ISPs in the United States and other countries.\n\nThe attack involved extremely high-rate UDP floods targeting a specific public IP address, launched from over 500,000 source IPs across various regions. These sudden UDP bursts had minimal source spoofing and used random source ports, which helped simplify traceback and facilitated provider enforcement.\n\nAttackers are scaling with the internet itself. As fiber-to-the-home speeds rise and IoT devices get more powerful, the baseline for attack size keeps climbing.\n\nAs we approach the upcoming holiday season, it is essential to confirm that all internet-facing applications and workloads are adequately protected against DDOS attacks. Additionally, do not wait for an actual attack to assess your defensive capabilities or operational readiness—conduct regular simulations to identify and address potential issues proactively.\n\nLearn more about Azure DDOS Protection at [Azure DDoS Protection Overview | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview)\n\nPublished Nov 17, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure security](/tag/azure%20security?nodeId=board%3AAzureInfrastructureBlog)\n\n[cloud platform security](/tag/cloud%20platform%20security?nodeId=board%3AAzureInfrastructureBlog)\n\n[updates](/tag/updates?nodeId=board%3AAzureInfrastructureBlog)\n\n[!\\[Sean_Whalen&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xNjYwNjU4LUgwNkRSNA?image-coordinates=0%2C0%2C461%2C461&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/sean_whalen/1660658) [Sean_Whalen](/users/sean_whalen/1660658) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined December 20, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/sean_whalen/1660658)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azureinfrastructureblog [Azure Infrastructure Blog](/category/azure/blog/azureinfrastructureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
