  "Description": "I wanted to download Windows 11 from the Microsoft official website to reinstall my system. I was able to access all the steps on the Microsoft website, but when I got to the page to download the system, it wouldn't open and just showed a blank screen. I tried downloading Windows 10 instead, but got the same result. I tried different browsers and computers, but nothing worked. What could be the reason for this, and is there a solution?",
