  "Description": "As organizations evolve their application and storage environments, whether on‑premises, hybrid, or cloud, secure access is top of mind. Organizations are vigilant about protecting sensitive data while enabling agile application access across distributed environments. SMB shares are commonly used for persistent storage in applications like AKS for container workloads, web applications, and App Services. Traditional models that rely on credentials like storage account keys do not meet the demands of a Zero Trust architecture, where every access request must be verified explicitly, granted with least privilege, and designed to assume malicious access from bad actors.\n\nWe are excited to announce the **Public Preview** of Managed Identities support with Azure Files SMB. This capability provides a secure, identity-driven approach for customer applications that eliminates credentials-based access and integrates seamlessly with MS Entra ID. Azure virtual machines, containers, and applications running in Azure can now authenticate to Azure Files using their own managed identity, and mount shares using short lived OAuth tokens over Kerberos. This unlocks secure file share access for both first party and customer applications, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Functions, App Services, and other cloud native services\n\nBy leveraging Managed Identities, customers gain:\n\n- **Zero Trust Alignment**–Identity tied to a specific resource, token refreshes every hour, and no passwords or keys to manage or rotate with Azure handling end-to-end identity management\n- **Role Based Access Control** – Built-in RBAC for least-privilege enforcement\n- **Compliance Mandate Resolution** – Compliant with FIPS, removing need for NTLMv2\n- **Multi** **-Client Support** – Works with Windows and Linux clients over SMB\n\nThis capability brings a secure, simple, and scalable access model that helps organizations meet industry standard security requirements while inheriting Microsoft Entra ID’s enterprise grade identity, governance, and security capabilities for file shares.\n\n![]()\n\n## Securing Real World Applications\n\nTo illustrate how Managed Identities strengthen security, the following example workloads highlight where customers will benefit from this capability.\n\n### Eliminate Secret Sprawl for Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workloads\n\nAzure Files SMB provides a centralized location for storing software development artifacts generated during CI/CD pipelines. CI/CD workloads span far beyond application code, covering infrastructure updates, data engineering workflows, ML pipelines, and compliance automation, making them foundational to modern DevOps practices.\n\nBuild agents in Azure DevOps or other CI/CD systems often run on both Linux and Windows, requiring a common storage backend for binaries and configuration files.
