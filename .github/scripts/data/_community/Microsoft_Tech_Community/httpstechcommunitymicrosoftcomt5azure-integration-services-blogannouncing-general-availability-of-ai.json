  "Title": "🎉 Announcing General Availability of AI & RAG Connectors in Logic Apps (Standard)",
  "ProcessedDate": "2025-12-02 00:10:08",
  "FeedName": "Microsoft Tech Community",
  "Description": "We’re excited to share that a comprehensive set of **AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities is now **Generally Available** in **Azure Logic Apps (Standard)**. This release brings native support for document processing, semantic retrieval, embeddings, and grounded reasoning directly into the Logic Apps workflow engine.\n\n## 🔌 **Available AI Connectors in Logic Apps Standard**\n\nLogic Apps (Standard) had previously previewed **four AI-focused connectors** that open the door for a new generation of intelligent automation across the enterprise. Whether you're processing large volumes of documents, enriching operational data with intelligence, or enabling employees to interact with systems using natural language, these connectors provide the foundation for building solutions that are smarter, faster, and more adaptable to business needs. These are now in GA.\n\nThey allow teams to move from *routine workflow automation* to *AI-assisted decisioning, contextual responses, and multi-step orchestration that reflects real business intent*. Below is the full set of **built-in** connectors and their actions as they appear in the designer.\n\n### **1. Azure OpenAI**\n\n##### **Actions**\n\n- Get an embedding\n- Get chat completions\n- Get chat completions using Prompt Template\n- Get completion\n- Get multiple chat completions\n- Get multiple embeddings\n\n##### **What this unlocks**\n\nBring natural language reasoning and structured AI responses directly into workflows. Common scenarios include guided decisioning, user-facing assistants, classification and routing, or preparing embeddings for semantic search and RAG workflows.\n\n### **2. Azure AI Search**\n\n##### **Actions**\n\n- Delete a document\n- Delete multiple documents\n- Get agentic retrieval output (Preview)\n- Index a document\n- Index multiple documents\n- Merge document\n- Search vectors\n- Search vectors with natural language\n\n##### **What this unlocks**\n\nAdd vector, hybrid semantic, and natural language search directly to workflow logic. Ideal for retrieving relevant content from enterprise data, powering search-driven workflows, and grounding AI responses with context from your own documents.\n\n### **3. Azure AI Document Intelligence**\n\n##### **Action**\n\n- Analyze document\n\n##### **What this unlocks**\n\nDocument Intelligence serves as the entry point for document-heavy scenarios. It extracts structured information from PDFs, images, and forms, allowing workflows to validate documents, trigger downstream processes, or feed high-quality data into search and embeddings pipelines.\n\n### **4. AI Operations**\n\n##### **Actions**\n\n- Chunk text with metadata\n- Parse document with metadata\n\n##### **What this unlocks**\n\nTransform unstructured files into enriched, structured content. Enables token-aware chunking, page-level metadata, and clean preparation of content for embeddings and semantic search at scale.\n\n## 🤖 **Advanced AI & Agentic Workflows with AgentLoop**\n\nLogic Apps (Standard) also supports **AgentLoop** (also Generally Available), allowing AI models to use workflow actions as tools and iterate until the task is complete. Combined with chunking, embeddings, and natural language search, this opens the door to advanced agentic scenarios such as document intelligence agents, RAG-based assistants, and iterative evaluators.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWith these capabilities now built into Logic Apps Standard, teams can bring AI directly into their integration workflows without additional infrastructure or complexity. Whether you’re streamlining document-heavy processes, enabling richer search experiences, or exploring more advanced agentic patterns, these capabilities provide a strong foundation to start building today.",
