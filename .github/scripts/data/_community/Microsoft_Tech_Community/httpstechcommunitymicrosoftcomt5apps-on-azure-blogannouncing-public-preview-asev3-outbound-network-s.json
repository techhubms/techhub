This means you can now segment outbound traffic at an app level, enabling¬†**fine-grained egress control** that aligns with enterprise security policies and compliance requirements.\n\nPreviously, all outbound traffic from an App Service Environment v3 originated from the full subnet range hosting the App Service Environment, making it difficult for networking teams to apply per-app restrictions, like what is available with the multi-tenant App Service offering. With this new capability, you can now:\n\n- For each app, **define the subnet all outbound traffic is routed through**.\n- Assign¬†**dedicated outbound IPs** per app via NAT Gateways.\n- Route traffic through **custom firewalls or appliances**.\n- Apply **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** with greater precision.\n- Improve **auditability and compliance** for regulated workloads.\n\nIn an App Service Environment, each worker is assigned an IP from the subnet, but there is no way to group IPs from various apps/plans to allow for routing/blocking/allowing specific app traffic from a networking perspective. With outbound network segmentation, you can now direct various app traffic to the same subnet/virtual network and gain this level of control.\n\nFor example, consider the following scenario where you would like to ensure that only App A is able to talk to Database A. To ensure only traffic from App A can reach Database A, you join App A to an alternate subnet (vnet-integration-subnet). The alternate subnet has network access to the private endpoint subnet via NSG. This means that only traffic from the virtual network integration subnet can reach the private endpoint subnet, which then gives access to the database.\n\n### üß™ What‚Äôs Included in the Public Preview?\n\nThis feature is currently available in all public Azure regions. If you're interested in trying it out, you will need to **create a new App Service Environment** and **enable the following cluster setting during creation**. Cluster settings can be configured using an ARM/Bicep template. For guidance on configuring cluster settings, see [Custom configuration settings for App Service Environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/app-service-app-service-environment-custom-settings).\n\n``` \"clusterSettings\": [ { \"name\": \"MultipleSubnetJoinEnabled\", \"value\": \"true\" } ] ```\n\nOnce the App Service Environment is created and this cluster setting is enabled, you will have access to join apps to alternate subnets at any time. However, if you don't set the cluster setting during creation, the App Service Environment will not support this feature. Enabling this feature on existing App Service Environments is not supported.\n\nPortal support for enabling this cluster setting as well as joining alternate subnets is not available at this time.¬†To configure the cluster setting, use an ARM/Bicep template to create the App Service Environment.\n\nTo join an alternate subnet, you can use the following Azure CLI command. **The alternate subnet must be empty and be delegated to Microsoft.web/serverfarms** prior to attempting to join it. Also ensure that [application traffic routing is enabled for your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-vnet-integration-routing#configure-application-routing). This is key to ensure all traffic is routed through the alternate subnet and not the default route.\n\n``` az webapp vnet-integration add --resource-group <APP-RESOURCE-GROUP> --name <APP-NAME> --vnet <VNET-NAME> --subnet <ALTERNATE-SUBNET-NAME> ```\n\nIf your alternate subnet is in a different resource group than your app, run \"az webapp vnet-integration add -h\" and see the help text to learn how to specify this resource id.\n\n### üîß Tech Specs\n\nIf you're familiar with the [multi-plan subnet join](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-vnet-integration#:~:text=With%20multi%20plan,larger%20subnet%20ranges.) feature available in the multi-tenant App Service offering, unfortunately, App Service Environments and the alternate subnet join feature are incompatible with multi-plan subnet join. For App Service Environments, each app from a given plan can only integrate with 1 alternate subnet.\n\nSimilar to regular virtual network integration, however, a given plan can have multiple different connections and apps in the same plan can use either of the connections. For multi-tenant App Service, this is limited to 2 connections per plan. For App Service Environment v3, you can have up to 4 connections.\n\nIf you need to remove or change the alternate subnet join for a specific app, you can do this at any time. First remove the existing join, and then add a new one following the same process as you did previously.\n\n### üí° Why This Feature Matters\n\nApp Service Environment v3 has always been about **isolation, scalability, and control**. With outbound segmentation, we‚Äôre taking that control to the next level. Whether you're running high-scale web apps, handling sensitive data, or managing complex environments, this feature gives you the tools to¬†**secure outbound traffic without compromising performance**.\n\n### üìö Learn More\n\nTo dive deeper into App Service Environment v3 networking capabilities, check out the [App Service Environment v3 networking overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/networking).\n\nHave questions or feedback?
