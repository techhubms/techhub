  "Title": "General Availability: Large Message Support in Azure Event Hubs",
  "Description": "[Azure Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-about)is a cloud-native service that streams millions of events per second with minimal latency, fully compatible with Apache Kafka and requiring no code changes for existing Kafka workloads.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce the general availability of Large Message Support in Azure Event Hubs, enabling you to send and receive messages up to **20 MB** in self-serve scalable Dedicated clusters, with enhanced reliability for seamless handling of large messages and greater flexibility for your data streaming solutions.\n\nThis feature enables fast and reliable processing of larger, indivisible events. Large Message Support works with both AMQP and Apache Kafka protocols, allowing you to send bigger payloads as usual without changing your client code. It is advisable to check your client settings to ensure that timeouts and maximum message size limits are not set too low on the client side.\n\nTo enable Large Message Support, simply configure your eligible event hubs dedicated clusters using the Azure Portal. For further details and eligibility, please visit aka.ms/largemessagesupportforeh.\n\nYour feedback is invaluable to us, and we look forward to hearing about your experiences.\n\nRead more:\n\n[Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka - Azure Event Hubs | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/azure-event-hubs-apache-kafka-overview)\n\n[Quickstart: Send and Receive Large Messages with Azure Event Hubs (Preview) - Azure Event Hubs | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quickstart-stream-large-messages)",
