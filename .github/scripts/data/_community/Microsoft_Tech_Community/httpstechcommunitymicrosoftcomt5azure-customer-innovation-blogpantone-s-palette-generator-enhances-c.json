  "EnhancedContent": "## Pantone, the global color authority and provider of digital solutions for the design community, built the Pantone Palette Generator, an AI-powered design agent that runs on Microsoft Foundry and Azure Cosmos DB to help creatives and designers generate color palettes in seconds.\n\nColor can be powerful. When creative professionals shape the mood and direction of their work, color plays a vital role because it provides context and cues for the end product or creation. For more than 60 years, creatives from all areas of design—including fashion, product, and digital—have turned to Pantone color guides to translate inspiration into precise, reproducible color choices. These guides offer a shared language for colors, as well as inspiration and communication across industries. Once rooted in physical tools, Pantone has evolved to meet the needs of modern creators through its trend forecasting, consulting services, and digital platform.\n\nToday, Pantone Connect and its multi-agent solution called the Pantone [Palette Generator](https://www.pantone.com/color-tools/palette-generator) seamlessly bring color inspiration and accuracy into everyday design workflows (as well as the [New York City mayoral race](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rdaniel-foster/2025/11/05/new-pantone-ai-tool-turns-new-york-city-mayor-race-into-color-palettes/)). Simply by typing in a prompt, designers can generate palettes in seconds. Available in Pantone Connect, the tool uses Azure services like [Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry), [Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search), and [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db) to serve up the company’s vast collection of trend and color research from the color experts at the Pantone Color Institute.\n\n“Pantone bridges art and industry—turning creative concepts into reality,” says Sky Kelley, President of Pantone. “Years of research and insights are reached in seconds instead of days. Now, with Microsoft Foundry, creatives can use agents to get instant color palettes and suggestions based on human insights and trend direction.”\n\n**Turning Pantone’s color legacy into an AI offering**\n\nThe Palette Generator accelerates the process of researching colors and helps designers find inspiration or validate some of their ideas through trend-backed research. “Pantone wants to be where our customers are,” says Rohani Jotshi, Director of Software Engineering and Data at Pantone. “As workflows become increasingly digital, we wanted to give our customers a way to find inspiration while keeping the same level of accuracy and trust they expect from Pantone.” The Palette Generator taps into thousands of articles from Pantone’s *Color Insider* library, as well as trend guides and physical color books in a way that preserves the company’s color standards science while streamlining the creative process. Built entirely on Microsoft Foundry, the solution uses Azure AI Search for agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models to reason over the data. It quickly serves up palette options in response to questions like “Show me soft pastels for an eco-friendly line of baby clothes” or “I want to see vibrant metallics for next spring.”\n\nOver the course of two months, the Pantone team built the initial proof of concept for the Palette Generator, using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/copilot) to streamline the process and save over 200 hours of work across multiple sprints. This allowed Pantone’s engineers to focus on improving prompt engineering, adding new agent capabilities, and refining orchestration logic rather than writing repetitive code.\n\n**Building a multi-agent architecture that accelerates creativity**\n\nThe Pantone team worked with Microsoft to develop the multi-agent architecture, which is made up of three connected agents. Using [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview)—an open source development kit for building AI orchestration systems—it was a straightforward process to bring the agents together into one workflow. “The Microsoft team recommended Microsoft Agent Framework and when we tried it, we saw how it was extremely fast and easy to create architectural patterns,” says Kristijan Risteski, Solutions Architect at Pantone. “With Microsoft Agent Framework, we can spin up a model in five lines of code to connect our agents.”\n\nWhen a user types in a question, they interact with an orchestrator agent that routes prompts and coordinates the more specialized agents. Behind the scenes an additional agent retrieves contextually relevant insights from Pantone’s proprietary *Color Insider* dataset. Using Azure AI Search with vectorized data indexing, this agent interprets the semantics of a user’s query rather than relying solely on keywords. A third agent then applies rules from color science to assemble a balanced palette. This agent ensures the output is a color combination that meets harmony, contrast, and accessibility standards. The result is a set of Pantone-curated colors that match the emotional and aesthetic tone of the request. “All of this happens in seconds,” says Risteski.\n\nTo manage conversation flow and achieve long-term data persistence, Pantone uses Azure Cosmos DB, which stores user sessions, prompts, and results. The database not only enables designers to revisit past palette explorations but also provides Pantone with valuable usage intelligence to refine the system over time. “We use Azure Cosmos DB to track inputs and outputs,” says Risteski. “That data helps us fine-tune prompts, measure engagement, and plan how we’ll train future models.”\n\n**Improving accuracy and performance with Azure AI Search**\n\nWith Azure AI Search, the Palette Generator can understand the nuance of color language. Instead of relying solely on keyword searches that might miss the complexity of words like “vibrant” or “muted,” Pantone’s team decided to use a vectorized index for more accurate palette results. Using the built-in vectorization capability of Azure AI Search, the team converted their color knowledge base—including text-based color psychology and trend articles—into numerical embeddings. “Overall, vector search gave us better results because it could understand the intent of the prompt, not just the words,“ says Risteski. “If someone types, ‘Show me colors that feel serene and oceanic,’ the system understands intent. It finds the right references across our color psychology and trend archives and delivers them instantly.”\n\nThe team also found ways to reduce latency as they evolved their proof of concept. Initially, they encountered slow inference times and performance lags when retrieving search results. By switching from GPT-4.1 to GPT-5, latency improved. And using Azure AI Search to manage ranking and filtering results helped reduce the number of calls to the large language model (LLM). “With Azure, we just get the articles, put them in a bucket, and say ‘index it now,’ says Risteski. “It takes one or two minutes—and that’s it. The results are so much better than traditional search.”\n\n**Moving from inspiration to palettes faster**\n\nThe Palette Generator has transformed how designers and color enthusiasts interact with Pantone’s expertise. What once took weeks of research and review can now be done in seconds. “Typically, if someone wanted to develop a palette for a product launch, it might take many months of research,” says Jotshi. “Now, they can type one sentence to describe their inspiration then immediately find Pantone-backed insight and options. Human curation will still be hugely important, but a strong set of starting options can significantly accelerate the palette development process.”\n\n**Expanding the palette: The next phase for Pantone’s design agent**\n\nRapidly launching the Palette Generator in beta has redefined what the Pantone engineering team thought was possible. “We’re a small development team, but with Azure we built an enterprise-grade AI system in a matter of weeks,” says Risteski. “That’s a huge win for us.” Next up, the team plans to migrate the entire orchestration layer to [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions), moving to a fully scalable, serverless deployment. This will allow Pantone to run its agents more efficiently, handle variable workloads automatically, and integrate seamlessly with other Azure products such as Microsoft Foundry and Azure Cosmos DB. At the same time, Pantone plans to expand its multi-agent system to include new specialized agents, including one focused on palette harmony and another focused on trend prediction.\n\nUpdated Nov 15, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure](/tag/azure?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[azure ai](/tag/azure%20ai?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[azure ai search](/tag/azure%20ai%20search?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[azure cosmos db](/tag/azure%20cosmos%20db?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[azure functions](/tag/azure%20functions?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[azure openai](/tag/azure%20openai?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[GitHub Copilot](/tag/GitHub%20Copilot?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[Microsoft Agent Framework](/tag/Microsoft%20Agent%20Framework?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[Microsoft Foundry](/tag/Microsoft%20Foundry?nodeId=board%3Aazure-customer-innovation-blog)\n\n[!\\[mtoiba&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xNzc3MjY0LTU2MDg4M2k3MkYyM0QwRUI4MDQzOEFG?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/mtoiba/1777264) [mtoiba](/users/mtoiba/1777264) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined March 14, 2023\n\n[View Profile](/users/mtoiba/1777264)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azure-customer-innovation-blog [Azure Customer Innovation Blog](/category/azure/blog/azure-customer-innovation-blog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
