  "Description": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm encountering a persistent issue with Persian font rendering in **Microsoft Word for macOS**. When using fonts from the **B family**—especially the widely used **B Nazanin**—letters do not connect properly. For example, in words like \"خیابان\" or \"ایران\", the characters appear disjointed, breaking the natural flow of Persian script.\n\nThis issue affects **all fonts in the B family**, including B Nazanin, B Mitra, B Titr, and others. These fonts are extremely popular and commonly used in Persian-language documents, both professionally and academically. The problem seems specific to Word on macOS, as the same fonts render correctly in **Apple’s Pages app**, where letter connections are preserved.\n\nI’ve tried:\n\n- Reinstalling and testing multiple versions of B fonts\n- Adjusting language and region settings\n- Enabling complex script support\n\nNone of these resolved the issue.\n\n### **Request**\n\nCan Microsoft investigate this rendering inconsistency in Word for macOS? Proper support for Persian script—especially for widely used fonts like the B family—is essential for users in Iran and Persian-speaking communities worldwide.\n\nAny help, workaround, or insight from the community or Microsoft team would be greatly appreciated.\n\n![]()",
