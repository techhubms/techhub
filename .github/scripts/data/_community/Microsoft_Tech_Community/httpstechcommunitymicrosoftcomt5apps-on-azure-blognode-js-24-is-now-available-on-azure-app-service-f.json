You can create a new Node 24 app through the Azure portal, automate it with the Azure CLI, or roll it out using your favorite ARM/Bicep templates - faster runtime, tighter tooling, same App Service simplicity.\n\nA quick look at what the new runtime gives you:\n\n1. **Faster, more modern JavaScript** Node.js 24 ships with the V8 13.6 engine and npm 11. You get newer JavaScript capabilities like `RegExp.escape`\n, `Float16Array` for tighter numeric data, improved async context handling, global `URLPattern` , and better WebAssembly memory support. All of this means cleaner code and better performance without extra polyfills or libraries. This release line is an even-numbered release and has moved into Long Term Support (LTS) in October 2025, which makes it a safe target for production apps.\n2. **Cleaner built-in testing workflows** The built-in `node:test`\nrunner in Node.js 24 now automatically waits on nested subtests, so you get reliable, predictable test execution without wiring up manual `await` logic or pulling in a third-party test framework. That means fewer flaky “test didn’t finish” errors in CI.\n\nFor full release details, see the official Node.js 24 release notes: [https://nodejs.org/blog/release/v24.0.0](https://nodejs.org/blog/release/v24.0.0)\n\nBring your Node.js 24 app to App Service for Linux, scale it, monitor it, and take advantage of the latest runtime improvements.\n\nUpdated Nov 11, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure app service](/tag/azure%20app%20service?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[azure paas](/tag/azure%20paas?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[node.js](/tag/node.js?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[TulikaC&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/tulikac/1661700) [TulikaC](/users/tulikac/1661700) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined December 21, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/tulikac/1661700)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
