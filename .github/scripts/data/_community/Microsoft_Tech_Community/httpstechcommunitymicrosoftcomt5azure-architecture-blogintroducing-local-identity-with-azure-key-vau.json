  "Description": "We’re excited to announce [public preview of local identity with Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/deploy/deployment-local-identity-with-key-vault) that allows you to deploy an azure local cluster which is not dependent on active directory. With **Local Identity and Azure Key Vault integration**, you can:\n\n- **Remove dependencies on existing infrastructure**\nNo need for Active Directory—simplify deployments and reduce complexity.\n- **Streamline backing of keys to Key Vault**\nSeamless key vault integration which allows backing up of keys to azure key vault\n- **Enable partner ecosystem compatibility**\nWe’re working with backup partners like **Veeam** and **Commvault** to ensure backup software works seamlessly in AD-less environments. We are also working with hardware partners like Dell and Lenovo\n\nTry the **public preview** and validate how the solution works email [mailto:azurelocalidentity@microsoft.com with any questions or concerns](mailto:azurelocalidentity@microsoft.com)\n\n**Private Preview Announcement**\n\nWe’re introducing two new features for Local Identity clusters in **private preview**:\n\n- **Management Toolkit**\nA guided setup for configuring an admin workstation to securely manage clusters without AD.\n\n**Management Toolkit Highlights**\n\n- Aligns local admin accounts and installs required certificates.\n- Applies safe defaults for protocols, authentication, and firewall settings.\n- Provides optional helpers for MMC tools like Failover Cluster Manager and Hyper-V Manager.\n\n**Important:** This toolkit does **not** replace your existing tools—it enables them to work seamlessly with Local Identity clusters.\n\n- **Internal DNS**\nProvides name resolution within the cluster without requiring Active Directory.\n\n**Internal DNS Overview**\n\n- Simplifies hostname resolution for nodes, VMs, and services.\n- Tunable resource consumption for constrained environments.\n- Enable via **Azure Local portal** during deployment.\n\n**Interested?** If you are interested in being a part of the private preview please email **azurelocalidentity@microsoft.com**. **Prerequisite:** Build **2510 or later**.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n- Upgrade to **build 2510 or later**.\n- Explore Local Identity with Azure Key Vault.\n- Join the private preview for Management Toolkit and Internal DNS.\n- Share feedback on **azurelocalidentity@microsoft.com**.",
