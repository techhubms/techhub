Machine Configuration (previously known as Azure Policy Guest Configuration) enables both built-in and custom configuration as code allowing you to audit and configure OS, app, and workload level settings at scale, both for machines running in Azure and hybrid Azure Arc-enabled servers.*\n\nWe’re excited to announce [**Public Preview support for Customizable Security Baselines**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/how-to/assign-security-baselines/overview-page) in **[Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) and [Machine Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview/01-overview-concepts)**. This feature empowers you to tailor industry security benchmarks—such as [CIS benchmarks for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-cis-linux) or Azure Security Baselines for [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-windows-server-2025)and [Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-linux)—to align with your organization’s unique compliance standards across both Azure and [Arc-connected machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/overview). This feature builds on top of our existing audit baseline capabilities for Windows and Linux.\n\nNow you can **create, parameterize, and assign custom baselines at scale**, enabling [continuous compliance visibility across your entire environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/how-to/view-compliance). Learn more about how to get started here: Customize Security Baselines with Azure Policy and Machine Configuration.\n\n## What's New?\n\nCustomizable **security baselines** in **Azure Policy** and **Machine Configuration** bring a powerful new way to **assess, monitor, and improve your security posture** across both Windows and Linux servers. Built on industry benchmarks such as the **Center for Internet Security (CIS)** and Microsoft’s own **Azure Compute Security Baselines**, this capability enables you to adapt compliance frameworks to your organization’s specific needs — all while maintaining a consistent governance model across Azure and hybrid environments. By passing **custom baseline parameters directly into Azure Policy**, you can represent internal controls at scale, ensuring that compliance reflects your enterprise’s unique standards and regulatory requirements.\n\nThis cloud-native approach embodies Microsoft’s **Secure by Design** and **Secure by Default** principles — ensuring your workloads stay compliant, wherever they run.\n\nBaselines Customization Experience in Azure Policy\n\n## Key Scenarios\n\n### Baseline Customization\n\nTailor your security standards through the **Modify Settings** wizard under **Policy &gt; Machine Configuration**. You can:\n\n- Enable, exclude, or adjust rules from existing benchmarks\n- Apply organization-specific parameters\n- Export your custom configuration as a downloadable JSON file\n\nEach baseline JSON file serves as a **reusable, declarative artifact**—ideal for **policy-as-code** workflows, version control, and CI/CD integration.\n\n### Assign Audit Policies\n\nWhen you assign a baseline via Azure Policy, it automatically:\n\n- Evaluates configurations against your defined standards\n- Reports compliance in near real time\n- Surfaces findings in **Azure Policy**, **Azure Resource Graph**, and the **Guest Assignments** view\n\nThis integrated visibility helps IT administrators, security teams, and auditors track compliance status with minimal overhead.\n\n### Integration and Automation\n\nSecurity baselines integrate seamlessly into your **DevOps pipelines** and **configuration management workflows**. Each baseline produces a **declarative settings catalog (JSON)** that can be versioned and deployed using:\n\n- Azure CLI\n- ARM templates\n- Bicep\n- CI/CD automation\n\nThis ensures reproducible, traceable compliance configurations across environments.\n\n## Supported Standards\n\n| Standard | Description | | --- | --- | | **CIS Linux Benchmarks** | Official CIS Benchmarks for Azure-endorsed Linux distributions, matching the latest CIS versions. | | **Azure Compute Security Baseline for Windows** | Applies security controls for Windows Server 2022 and 2025, aligned with Azure Compute guidance. | | **Azure Compute Security Baseline for Linux** | Enforces consistent controls aligned with Azure Compute recommendations. |\n\n## Availability\n\nCustomizable security baselines are available in **all public Azure regions**.\n\n> >\n> **NOTE:**\n> Support for **Azure Government** and **Sovereign Clouds** will be added in a future release. These environments are not included in the current Public Preview.\n> >\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin:\n\n- Deploy the [**Azure Machine Configuration prerequisite policy initiative.**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/InitiativeDetail.ReactView/id/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicySetDefinitions%2F12794019-7a00-42cf-95c2-882eed337cc8)\n(This installs the required Guest Configuration extension on supported VMs.)\n- Ensure your **Azure subscription or management group** includes supported Windows or Linux VMs.\n- Have sufficient permissions (Owner or Resource Policy Contributor) to create and assign custom policy definitions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guidance\n\n1. **Select a baseline** from the **Machine Configuration** tab in **Azure Policy**.\n2. **Modify settings** to enable, exclude, or parameterize rules to match your internal policies.\n3. **Download JSON** to export your customized baseline configuration file for programmatic and repeatable customization.\n4. **Assign the policy** which can be deployed through the Azure portal, CLI, or your CI/CD pipeline.\n5. **Review compliance results** to **** track outcomes in Azure Policy, Azure Resource Graph, or the Guest Assignments page.\n\nLearn More\n\n- [Azure Machine Configuration security baselines official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/how-to/assign-security-baselines/overview-page)\n- [CIS Benchmark for Linux documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-cis-linux)\n- [Azure Windows Baseline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-windows-server-2025) and [Azure Linux Baseline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-linux) documentation\n\n*Please note that the use of Azure Machine Configuration on Azure Arc-enabled servers will incur a charge.*\n\nPublished Nov 13, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[governance](/tag/governance?nodeId=board%3AAzureGovernanceandManagementBlog)\n\n[guest configuration](/tag/guest%20configuration?nodeId=board%3AAzureGovernanceandManagementBlog)\n\n[management](/tag/management?nodeId=board%3AAzureGovernanceandManagementBlog)\n\n[msignite](/tag/msignite?nodeId=board%3AAzureGovernanceandManagementBlog)\n\n[policy](/tag/policy?nodeId=board%3AAzureGovernanceandManagementBlog)\n\n[!\\[mutemwamasheke&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0yMDQ5ODA3LWpUQzdMMQ?image-coordinates=0%2C0%2C800%2C800&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/mutemwamasheke/2049807) [mutemwamasheke](/users/mutemwamasheke/2049807) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined September 26, 2023\n\n[View Profile](/users/mutemwamasheke/2049807)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azuregovernanceandmanagementblog [Azure Governance and Management Blog](/category/azure/blog/azuregovernanceandmanagementblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
