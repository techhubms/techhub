This will help to enable organizations to bring confidential workloads to the cloud without code changes to applications. These instances also enable [Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/accelerator-engines/what-is-intel-amx.html) (Intel® AMX) to accelerate confidential AI scenarios. Supported SKUs include the general-purpose DCesv6-series, as well as the memory-optimized ECesv6-series.\n\nConfidential VMs are designed for tenants with [high security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html) and confidentiality requirements, providing a strong, attestable, hardware-enforced boundary. They ensure that your data and applications stay private and encrypted even while in use, keeping your sensitive code and other data encrypted in memory during processing.\n\n**Improvements for next milestone**\n\nAs a first for Azure’s Confidential VM offerings, we are soon adding support for **local NVMe SSDs for our DCedsv6-series and ECedsv6-series**. These sizes are suited for storage workloads that need a balance of SSD capacity, compute, and memory. With NVMe we can achieve nearly 5× more throughput while reducing latency by about 16% compared to the previous SCSI generation. Overall, we see lower IO latency by ~27 microseconds across block size and thread count.\n\nThis figure shows NVMe vs SCSI local disk performance ratio for IOPS to latency for random reads with 8K block size, queue depth of 1, and 1 thread.This figure shows NVMe vs SCSI local disk performance for random reads with 8K block size and queue depth of 8 across various thread counts.\n\nAdditionally, these TDX confidential VMs are Azure’s first offering to utilize our [**open-source**](https://github.com/microsoft/openvmm) **paravisor,**[**OpenHCL**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windowsosplatform/openhcl-the-new-open-source-paravisor/4273172)**.** This innovation allows us to enhance transparency with our customers, reinforcing our commitment to the \"trust but verify\" model. These VMs also support **Azure Boost,** enabling up to 205k IOPS and 4 GB/s throughput of remote storage along with 40 Gbps VM network bandwidth.\n\n**Customers are excited to use TDX based Confidential VMs**\n\n“At Bosch Trustworthy Collaboration Services, we’ve enrolled our collaboration platform on Azure’s latest Confidential VMs powered by Intel’s 5th Generation Xeon processors with TDX support. That means better transparency, stronger performance, and more robust verification: the foundation we need for cross-company teamwork. These improvements reinforce our capability to deliver best-in-class secure collaboration capabilities to our customers with our Trusted Collaboration Spaces.” - Dr. Sven Trieflinger, CTO Bosch Trustworthy Collaboration Services\n\n“Ensuring data security across its entire lifecycle has always been a key priority for me. Until recently, encryption for data-in-use was the missing link, preventing true end-to-end protection managed by the customer.
