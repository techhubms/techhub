  "Description": "If you’re running a Small Language Model (SLM) as a sidecar with your web app, there’s now a faster way to try prompts, measure latency, and copy working code into your app—all without leaving your site. **AI Playground** is a lightweight, built-in experience available from the Kudu endpoint for every Linux App Service.\n\n#### What is AI Playground?\n\nAI Playground is a simple UI that talks to the SLM you’ve attached to your App Service app (for example, Phi or BitNet via the Sidecar extension). It lets you:\n\n- Send **system** and **user** prompts and view responses in-line\n- See **performance metrics** like Time to First Token (TTFT), total time, and tokens/sec\n- Grab **ready-to-use code snippets** for popular languages from the right sidebar (when you’re ready to integrate)\n- Confirm whether a sidecar SLM is configured—and get clear guidance if it isn’t\n\nSidecar SLMs were introduced earlier this year; they let you run models like **Phi** **** and **BitNet** alongside your app. Learn more: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-ai-slm-dotnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-ai-slm-dotnet)\n\n#### Where to find it the AI Playground\n\n1. In the Azure portal, go to your **App Service** (Linux).\n2. Open **Advanced Tools (Kudu)** → Go.\n3. In the Kudu left navigation, select **AI Playground**.\n\n***Note: A pre-requisite for the playground is already having an SLM sidecar setup with your application. Here is a tutorial to set it up [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-ai-slm-dotnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-ai-slm-dotnet)***\n\n#### A quick tour\n\n**Prompts panel**\n\n- Set a **System Prompt** (e.g., “You speak like a pirate.”) to steer behavior.\n- Enter a **User Prompt**, then click **Send to SLM**.\n\n**Performance metrics displayed**\n\n- **TTFT**: how quickly the first token arrives—great for responsiveness checks.\n- **Total**: overall response time.\n- **Tokens/sec**: sustained throughput for the generation.\n\n**Code integration examples**\n\n- On the right, you’ll find minimal snippets for C#, Python, and Node.js you can paste into your app later (no need to leave Kudu).\n\n![]()\n\n*Tip: Keep prompts compact for SLMs. If output slows, shorten the prompt or reduce requested length.*\n\n**Don’t have a sidecar yet?**\n\nIf AI Playground can’t find an SLM, you’ll see an inline notice with setup steps.\n\n![]()\n\nFull tutorial: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-ai-slm-dotnet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/tutorial-ai-slm-dotnet)\n\n#### Troubleshooting\n\n**No responses / timeouts**\n\n- Confirm the sidecar is Running in Deployment Center → Containers.\n- Check the sidecar’s port and endpoint\n\n**Slow TTFT or Tokens/sec**\n\n- Warm up with a couple of short prompts.\n- Consider scaling up to a Premium plan.\n- Keep prompts and requested outputs short.\n\n#### Roadmap\n\nThis is v1. We’re already working on:\n\n- **Bring-your-own LLMs** (play with different models beyond SLMs)\n- **Richer evaluation** (prompt presets, saved sessions, exportable traces)\n- **Better observability** (per-call logs, quick links to Log Stream)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\n**AI Playground** makes building AI features on App Service feel immediate - type, run, measure, and ship. We’ll keep smoothing the experience and unlocking more model choices so you can go from idea to integrated AI faster than ever.",
