  "Description": "Python apps on Azure App Service for Linux just got a lot easier to build and ship! We’ve modernized the build pipeline to support new deployment options —whether you’re on classic setup.py, fully on pyproject.toml with Poetry or uv, or somewhere in between.\n\nThis post walks through five upgrades that reduce friction end-to-end—from local dev to GitHub Actions to the App Service build environment:\n\n- **pyproject.toml + uv (and poetry):** modern, reproducible Python builds\n- **setup.py support**\n- **.bashrc quality-of-life improvements** in the App Service container shell\n- **GitHub Actions samples** for common Python flows (setup.py, uv.lock, local venv, and pyproject.toml deployments)\n\n#### pyproject.toml + uv\n\n**uv** is an extremely fast Python package & project manager written in Rust—think “pip + virtualenv + pip-tools,” but much faster and with first-class project workflows. ([Astral Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))\n\n**On App Service for Linux:** we’ve added automatic **uv** builds when your repo contains **both** `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` . That means reproducible installs with uv’s resolver—no extra switches needed.\n\n**What’s pyproject.toml?** It’s the standardized configuration for modern Python projects (PEP 621) where you declare metadata, dependencies, and your build backend. ([Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/))\n\n**Quickstart (new to uv?)**\n\n# in your project folder\n\n- pip install uv\nuv init\n\n`uv init` scaffolds a project and creates a pyproject.toml (and, for application projects, a sample main.py). Try it with `uv run` . ([Astral Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/))\n\nAdd dependencies:\n- uv add flask\n# add more as needed, e.g.:\n# uv add requests pillow\n\nA `uv.lock` file is generated to pin your dependency graph; uv then “syncs” from the lock for consistent installs. ([Astral Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/sync/))\n\nA minimal `pyproject.toml` for a Flask app:\n- [project]\nname = \"uv-pyproject\" version = \"0.1.0\" description = \"Add your description here\" readme = \"README.md\" requires-python = \">=3.14\" dependencies = [ \"flask>=3.1.2\", ]\n\n**If you prefer to keep main.py**\n\nApp Service’s default entry is app.py, so either rename main.py to app.py, **or** set a startup command:\n- uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n\nRun locally:\n- uv run app.py\n\n(uv run executes your script inside the project’s environment.) ([Astral Docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/))\n\nDeploy to **Azure App Service for Linux** using your favorite method (e.g., azd up, GitHub Actions, or VS Code). During the build, you’ll see logs like:\n- Detected uv.lock (and no requirements.txt); creating virtual environment with uv...\nInstalling uv... Requirement already satisfied: uv in /tmp/oryx/platforms/python/3.14.0/lib/python3.14/site-packages (0.9.7)\n\nExecuting: uv venv --link-mode=copy --system-site-packages antenv Using CPython 3.14.0 interpreter at: /tmp/oryx/platforms/python/3.14.0/bin/python3.14 Creating virtual environment at: antenv Activate with: source antenv/bin/activate Activating virtual environment... Detected uv.lock. Installing dependencies with uv... Resolved 9 packages in 1ms Installed 7 packages in 1.82s\n+ blinker==1.9.0\n+ click==8.3.0\n+ flask==3.1.2\n+ itsdangerous==2.2.0\n+ jinja2==3.1.6\n+ markupsafe==3.0.3\n+ werkzeug==3.1.3\n\n**Using pyproject.toml with Poetry**\n\nAlready on **Poetry**? Great—Poetry uses pyproject.toml (typically with [tool.poetry] plus a poetry.lock) and complies with PEP-517/PEP-621. If your project is Poetry-managed, App Service’s pyproject.toml support applies just the same. For details on fields and build configuration, see Poetry’s official docs: the pyproject.toml reference and basic usage. ([python-poetry.org](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/))\n\nWant to see a working uv example? Check the [**lowlight-enhancer-uv**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/appservice-ai-samples/tree/main/lowlight-enhancer-uv) Flask app in our samples repo (deployable with azd up).\n\n#### Support for setup.py\n\nsetup.py is the (Python) build/config script used by **Setuptools** to declare your project’s metadata and dependencies. Setuptools offers **first-class support** for setup.py, and it remains a valid way to package and install apps. ([Setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html))\n\n**Minimal setup.py for a Flask app**\n- # setup.py\nfrom setuptools import setup, find\\_packages\n\nsetup( name=\"flask-app\", version=\"0.1.0\", packages=find\\_packages(exclude=(\"tests\",)), python\\_requires=\">=3.14\", install\\_requires=[ \"Flask>=3.1.2\", ], include\\_package\\_data=True, )\n\nTip: `install_requires` and other fields are defined by `Setuptools` ; see the keywords reference for what you can configure. ([Setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/references/keywords.html))\n\n**What you’ll see during an App Service deployment**\n- Python Version: /tmp/oryx/platforms/python/3.14.0/bin/python3.14\nCreating directory for command manifest file if it does not exist Removing existing manifest file Python Virtual Environment: antenv Creating virtual environment...
