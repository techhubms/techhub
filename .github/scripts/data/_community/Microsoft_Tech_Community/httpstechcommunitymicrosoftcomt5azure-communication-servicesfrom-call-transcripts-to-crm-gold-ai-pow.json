  "Description": "Call transcripts are full of business intelligence that never makes it to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. Customer sentiment, promised follow-ups, escalation signals – all lost in walls of conversational text.\n\nWe’ve all seen it happen. Agent frantically scribbles notes during calls. Promised callbacks fall through cracks. Critical details get buried in transcript files that sit untouched for months. Meanwhile, your CRM holds half-empty case records and incomplete customer histories.\n\nWhat if those transcripts could talk back?\n\n## How We Transform Call Transcripts into CRM Data\n\nInstead of just explaining what's possible, we built something you can click through and try on your own.\n\n![]()The five-step workflow transforms raw customer conversations into structured business data with human oversight before CRM integration.\n\nPick from realistic customer scenarios – an airline passenger with a mystery credit card charge, a small business owner confused about cloud billing. Watch AI pull out the important stuff while you keep full control before anything touches your systems. Takes minutes, not hours.\n\nThe real value isn't just saving time on data entry. It's about not losing what actually happened on that call.\n\nIf you're more of a visual person and would like to see a video demonstration of this project in action, check out the walkthrough below:\n\n## How Human-AI Collaboration Ensures Reliable Results\n\nWe made some choices that matter if you're thinking about real business use.\n\n- **Raw transcripts are a mess.** Full of \"ums\" and \"let me transfer you\" and customers repeating themselves. AI cuts through all that noise to find what you need: the core issue, what you promised, what happens next. Your agents get the story, not a wall of text.\n- **Human oversight isn't just editing typos.** The demo shows what real business judgment looks like. Sometimes what sounds like anger is actually relief. Sometimes \"I'll call you back\" means different things in different contexts. AI spots patterns brilliantly, but humans understand nuance and catch the edge cases that matter for customer relationships.\n\n![]()Human reviewers can edit AI analysis before it goes to the CRM, ensuring business context and nuance are preserved in customer records\n- **Structured output changes guarantees consistent CRM data.** Here's the technical piece that makes everything else possible: we use JSON schemas to guarantee consistent results. Same format every time, no parsing messy text responses. Your CRM integration becomes trivial – clean data that maps directly to fields without custom logic to handle variations.\n\n![]()*AI-structured call data formatted as JSON payload ready for direct CRM integration via API*\n\n## Business Intelligence You Can Act on Immediately\n\nOnce you've got structured call intelligence, things get interesting fast.\n\nPicture this: sentiment analysis flags an angry customer at 2 PM. Your senior agent gets pinged before the promised callback at 4 PM. Or someone mentions a competitor during what should've been routine support. Your sales team knows by end of day, not next quarter.\n\nA customer describes the same technical issue three other people called about this week? Your product team sees the pattern before it becomes a crisis trending on social media.\n\nThe flow works the same whether you're dealing with frustrated airline customers, confused SaaS users, or financial service complaints. It’s the same AI extraction, same human review, just different actions triggered by what you find.\n\n![]()Structured call data unlocks immediate actions, business intelligence, and real-time agent support capabilities\n\n## The Real Opportunity\n\nEvery company with customer calls has intelligence locked in transcripts and recordings. Communication APIs plus AI can unlock that intelligence and automate workflows that currently eat up agent time.\n\nThis demo shows one practical path: structured AI analysis with human oversight, feeding straight into business systems. Scales from small teams manually reviewing suggestions to enterprise deployments processing thousands of calls with minimal human touch.\n\nYou're not just automating data entry. You're capturing business intelligence that vanishes the moment each call ends. And with the human review layer, you're building confidence in the system while training it to handle your specific business context.\n\n## How to Connect Live Call Data to Your AI Analysis\n\nReal implementations need live conversation data rather than static transcripts. That's where the integration work begins.\n\nAzure Communication Services [Call Automation APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/how-tos/call-automation/real-time-transcription-tutorial?pivots=programming-language-javascript) provide real-time transcription during calls. Microsoft Teams APIs extract transcripts from recorded meetings. Most phone systems can export call transcripts via API these days. The workflow stays identical – transcript → AI analysis → human review → business actions – but connecting those data sources requires additional plumbing.\n\nReal production systems also need async processing. Instead of waiting for AI analysis during the call, you'd typically queue transcripts for background processing and surface insights when agents need them.\n\n## Simple Technology Stack: Node.js + Azure OpenAI\n\nWe deliberately chose straightforward technology to prove a point: you don't need exotic tools for sophisticated call intelligence.\n\nNode.js backend. Vanilla JavaScript frontend. OpenAI structured output with strict JSON schemas. That's it.\n\n**What do we mean by \"structured output\"?** Instead of returning free-form text, the LLM is instructed to respond with JSON that matches a predefined schema. This ensures the output is predictable, machine-readable, and easy to integrate directly into systems like CRMs with no extra parsing or guesswork required.\n\nImportant caveat: not all LLMs support structured output yet. OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and a few others do, but if you're using a different provider, you'd need additional validation logic to ensure consistent formatting. The structured approach is what makes CRM integration seamless, so it's worth choosing providers that support it.\n\n## Try the Post-Call Intelligence Demo\n\nClone the [repository](https://github.com/seanryankeegan/post-call-intelligence) and test it out today! The demo includes setup instructions and realistic scenarios. Not production code, but shows how AI-powered call intelligence works in practice. Full instructions are in the README of the repo, but you only need to enter a few commands in your terminal.\n\n![]()Simple setup process: clone the repository, install dependencies, configure Azure OpenAI credentials, and launch the demo.\n\nFor more information and resources, check out [the docs on real-time transcription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/how-tos/call-automation/real-time-transcription-tutorial?pivots=programming-language-javascript) or see more [communication API + AI sample demos](https://github.com/Azure-Samples).\n\nThose transcripts sitting in your phone system? They're not just records of what happened. They're roadmaps for what should happen next. The intelligence is sitting there. The tools exist to extract it reliably. Question is whether you'll let it keep disappearing into the void.",
