  "Description": "Microsoft is setting the standard for global availability and security with Oracle Database@Azure. We’re excited to announce that Oracle Database@Azure is now live in 31 regions worldwide, including three new additions – giving enterprises more choice to run mission-critical Oracle workloads where they operate. With plans to bring two more regions online in the next three months, Oracle Database@Azure will continue to lead the industry with 33 regions around the world – more than any other hyperscaler.\n\nPlus, Azure Key Value (Standard, Premium, and Managed HSM) is now generally available for Oracle Autonomous AI Database on Oracle Database@Azure. Exadata Database and Autonomous AI Database on Oracle Database@Azure customers can now get built-in encryption and key control for uncompromised protection. Oracle Database@Azure offers customers more choice, more control, and more places to run mission-critical workloads.\n\n**Oracle Database@azure is now live in 31 regions worldwide**\n\nOracle Database@Azure is live in North Central, South India, and France South, giving enterprises more flexibility and control over global deployments of their business-critical applications. The service is now available in 31 regions, including:\n\nAustralia East • Australia Southeast • Brazil South • Canada Central • Canada East • Central India • Central US • East US • East US 2 • France Central • France South • Germany North • Germany West Central • Italy North • Japan East • Japan West • North Central US • North Europe • Southeast Asia • South Central US • South India • Spain Central • Sweden Central • Switzerland North • UAE Central • UAE North • UK South • UK West • West US • West US 2 • West US 3\n\nWe will be launching 2 additional regions in the next three months, bringing the total number of regions to 33 – more than any other hyperscaler.\n\n![]()\n\n**Key to even better security: Azure Key Vault GA powers secure Oracle workloads for Oracle Autonomous AI Database on Oracle Database@Azure**\n\nWe’re excited to announce expanded GA support for Azure Key Vault (Standard, Premium, and Managed HSM) for Oracle Autonomous AI Database on Oracle Database@Azure, enabling secure storage and management of Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) keys. This integration – now available for both Exadata Database and Autonomous AI Database on Oracle Database@Azure – centralizes key management within Azure’s governance, monitoring, and lifecycle tools, giving enterprises full control and compliance.\n\nCustomers gain flexibility to choose the right tier for their workloads—from dev/test to highly regulated environments—while simplifying operations and eliminating external key systems.
