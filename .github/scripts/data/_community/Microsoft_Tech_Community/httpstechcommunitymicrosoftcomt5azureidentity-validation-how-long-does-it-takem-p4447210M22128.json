  "EnhancedContent": "I’ve been trying to complete identity validation for **Azure Trusted Signing** so I can use it for code signing. My situation:\n\n- I submitted my business registration documents over 5 weeks ago. The status has been **\"In Progress\"** ever since.\n- I tried creating a new identity 2 weeks ago, but that one is also stuck \"In Progress.\"\n- I have not received any updates, rejections, or communication from support during this time.\n\nThe first few times I did the process it at least failed because I didn't attach the right email addresses, but now I am waiting endlessly.\n\nCould someone at Microsoft please advise on:\n\n1. Why my identity validation is stuck \"In Progress\" for so long.\n2. Whether I should restart the process or if it’s possible to get my current submission escalated.\n3. How to ensure the required documents (business registration, status of information, etc.) are properly reviewed.\n\nThanks to anyone who can help for their time! I feel stuck and this is directly impacting my business so I appreciate it.\n\nBest!",
