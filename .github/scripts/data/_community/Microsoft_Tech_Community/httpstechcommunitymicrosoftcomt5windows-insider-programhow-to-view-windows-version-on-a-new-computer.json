  "Description": "This is an unusual one for me. I bought my daughter a new HP laptop and after purchase I was looking at the specs and it said \"Windows 11 Pro S\". There's no Windows 11 Pro S, so I believe there was a typo in the description on Amazon. So here's my question. How can my daughter verify the version of Windows before creating an account and logging in? The reason I ask is because if it turns out the computer is Windows 11 Home S then she will not be able to use it for work and she has to return it. That's the reason I don't want her to log in and activate the system before verifying the version. At the start of the activation and before logging into a Microsoft account can you press Windows R and run winver? If you need more information, please ask. The laptop will be delivered to tomorrow (July 26) so a quick reply would be appreciated. Thanks!",
