  "Description": "## Introduction: The Evolution of AI-Powered App Service Applications\n\nOver the past few months, we've been exploring how to supercharge existing Azure App Service applications with AI capabilities. If you've been following along with this series, you've seen how we can [quickly integrate AI Foundry agents with MCP servers](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/supercharge-your-app-service-apps-with-ai-foundry-agents-connected-to-mcp-server/4444310) and [host remote MCP servers directly on App Service](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/host-remote-mcp-servers-on-app-service-updated-samples-now-with-new-languages-an/4420607).\n\nToday, we're taking the next leap forward by demonstrating how to build sophisticated **multi-agent systems** that leverage **connected agents**, **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, and **OpenAPI tools** - all running on Azure App Service's **Premium v4 tier** with **.NET Aspire** for enhanced observability and cloud-native development experience.\n\n> >\n> **💡 Want the full technical details?** This blog provides an overview of the key concepts and capabilities. For comprehensive setup instructions, architecture deep-dives, performance considerations, debugging guidance, and detailed technical documentation, check out the [complete README on GitHub](https://github.com/seligj95/app-service-aspire-eshop-agents).\n> >\n\n## What Makes This Sample Special?\n\nThis fashion e-commerce demo showcases several cutting-edge technologies working together:\n\n### 🤖 **Multi-Agent Architecture with Connected Agents**\n\nUnlike single-agent systems, this sample implements an orchestration pattern where specialized agents work together:\n\n- **Main Orchestrator**: Coordinates workflow and handles inventory queries via MCP tools\n- **Cart Manager**: Specialized in shopping cart operations via OpenAPI tools\n- **Fashion Advisor**: Provides expert styling recommendations\n- **Content Moderator**: Ensures safe, professional interactions\n\n### 🔧 **Advanced Tool Integration**\n\n- **MCP Tools**: Real-time connection to external inventory systems using the Model Context Protocol\n- **OpenAPI Tools**: Direct agent integration with your existing App Service APIs\n- **Connected Agent Tools**: Seamless agent-to-agent communication with automatic orchestration\n\n### ⚡ **.NET Aspire Integration**\n\n- Enhanced development experience with built-in observability\n- Simplified cloud-native application patterns\n- Real-time monitoring and telemetry (when developing locally)\n\n### 🚀 **Premium v4 App Service Tier**\n\n- Latest App Service performance capabilities\n- Optimized for modern cloud-native workloads\n- Enhanced scalability for AI-powered applications\n\n### Key Technical Innovations\n\n**Connected Agent Orchestration** Your application communicates with a single main agent, which automatically coordinates with specialist agents as needed. No changes to your existing App Service code required.\n\n**Dual Tool Integration** This sample demonstrates both [MCP tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/model-context-protocol#how-it-works) for external system connectivity and [OpenAPI tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/openapi-spec) for direct API integration.\n\n**Zero-Infrastructure Overhead** Agents work directly with your existing App Service APIs and external endpoints - no additional infrastructure deployment needed.\n\n## Why These Technologies Matter for Real Applications\n\nThe combination of these technologies isn't just about showcasing the latest features - it's about solving real business challenges. Let's explore how each component contributes to building production-ready AI applications.\n\n### .NET Aspire: Enhancing the Development Experience\n\nThis sample leverages .NET Aspire to provide enhanced observability and simplified cloud-native development patterns. While .NET Aspire is still in preview on App Service, we encourage you to start exploring its capabilities and keep an eye out for future updates planned for later this year.\n\nWhat's particularly exciting about Aspire is how it maintains the core principle we've emphasized throughout this series: **making AI integration as simple as possible**. You don't need to completely restructure your application to benefit from enhanced observability and modern development patterns.\n\n### Premium v4 App Service: Built for Modern AI Workloads\n\nThis sample is designed to run on Azure App Service Premium v4, which we recently announced is [Generally Available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-general-availability-of-premium-v4-for-azure-app-service/4446204). Premium v4 is the latest offering in the Azure App Service family, delivering enhanced performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.\n\n## From Concept to Implementation: Staying True to Our Core Promise\n\nThroughout this blog series, we've consistently demonstrated that adding AI capabilities to existing applications doesn't require massive rewrites or complex architectural changes. This multi-agent sample continues that tradition - what might seem like a complex system is actually built using the same principles we've established:\n\n✅ **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on your existing App Service infrastructure ✅ **Simple Integration**: Use familiar tools like `azd up` for deployment ✅ **Production-Ready**: Leverage mature Azure services you already trust ✅ **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend as new capabilities become available\n\n## Looking Forward: What's Coming Next\n\nThis sample represents just the beginning of what's possible with AI-powered App Service applications. Here's what we're working on next:\n\n### 🔐 **MCP Authentication Integration**\n\nEnhanced security patterns for production MCP server deployments, including Azure Entra ID integration.\n\n### 🚀 **New Azure AI Foundry Features**\n\nAs Azure AI Foundry continues to evolve, we'll be updating this sample to showcase:\n\n- New agent capabilities\n- Enhanced tool integrations\n- Performance optimizations\n- Additional model support\n\n### 📊 **Advanced Analytics and Monitoring**\n\nDeeper integration with Azure Monitor for:\n\n- Agent performance analytics\n- Business intelligence from agent interactions\n\n### 🔧 **Additional Programming Language Support**\n\nFollowing our [multi-language MCP server samples](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/host-remote-mcp-servers-on-app-service-updated-samples-now-with-new-languages-an/4420607), we'll be adding support for other languages in samples that will be added to the [App Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-ai-integration?tabs=dotnet).\n\n## Getting Started Today\n\nReady to add multi-agent capabilities to your existing App Service application?
