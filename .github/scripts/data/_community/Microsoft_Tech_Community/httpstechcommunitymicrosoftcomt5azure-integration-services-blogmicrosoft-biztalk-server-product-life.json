  "Description": "For more than 25 years, Microsoft BizTalk Server has supported mission-critical integration workloads for organizations around the world. From business process automation and B2B messaging to connectivity across industries such as financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and government, BizTalk Server has played a foundational role in enterprise integration strategies.\n\nTo help customers plan confidently for the future, Microsoft is sharing an update to the BizTalk Server product lifecycle and long-term support timelines.\n\n### **BizTalk Server 2020 will be the final version of BizTalk Server.**\n\n#### **Guidance to support long-term planning for mission-critical workloads**\n\nThis announcement does **not** change existing support commitments. Customers can continue to rely on BizTalk Server for many years ahead, with a clear and predictable runway to plan modernization at a pace that aligns with their business and regulatory needs.\n\n| **Lifecycle Phase** | **End Date** | **What’s Included** | | --- | --- | --- | | Mainstream Support | April 11, 2028 | Security + non-security updates and Customer Service & Support (CSS) support | | Extended Support | April 9, 2030 | CSS support, Security updates, and paid support for fixes (\\*) | | End of Support | April 10, 2030 | No further updates or support |\n\n(\\*) Paid **Extended Support** **** will be available for BizTalk Server 2020 between April 2028 and April 2030 for customers requiring hotfixes for non-security updates. CSS will continue providing their typical support. BizTalk Server 2016 is already out of mainstream support, and we recommend those customers evaluate a direct modernization path to Azure Logic Apps.\n\n#### **Continued Commitment to Enterprise Integration**\n\nMicrosoft remains fully committed to supporting mission-critical integration, including hybrid connectivity, future-ready orchestration, and B2B/EDI modernization. Azure Logic Apps, part of Azure Integration Services — which includes API Management, Service Bus, and Event Grid — delivers the comprehensive integration platform for the next decade of enterprise connectivity.\n\n#### **Host Integration Server: Continued Support for Mainframe Workloads**\n\n**Host Integration Server (HIS)** has long provided essential connectivity for organizations with mainframe and midrange systems. To ensure continued support for those workloads, **Host Integration Server 2028** will ship as a standalone product with its own lifecycle, decoupled from BizTalk Server. This provides customers with more flexibility and a longer planning horizon. Recognizing Mainframe modernization customers might be looking to integrate with their mainframes from Azure, Microsoft provides Logic Apps connectors for mainframe and midrange systems, and we are keen on adding more connectors in this space. Let us know about your HIS plans, and if you require specific features for Mainframe and midranges integration from Logic Apps at: [https://aka.ms/lamainframe](https://aka.ms/lamainframe)\n\n#### **Azure Logic Apps: The Successor to BizTalk Server**\n\n**Azure Logic Apps, part of Azure Integration Services**, is the modern integration platform that carries forward what customers value in BizTalk while unlocking new innovation, scale, and intelligence. With 1,400+ out-of-box connectors supporting enterprise, SaaS, legacy, and mainframe systems, organizations can reuse existing BizTalk maps, schemas, rules, and custom code to accelerate modernization while preserving prior investments including B2B/EDI and healthcare transactions.\n\nLogic Apps delivers elastic scalability, enterprise-grade security and compliance, and built-in cost efficiency without the overhead of managing infrastructure. Modern DevOps tooling, Visual Studio Code support, and infrastructure-as-code (ARM/Bicep) ensure consistent, governed deployments with end-to-end observability using Azure Monitor and OpenTelemetry.\n\nModernizing Logic Apps also unlocks agentic business processes, enabling AI-driven routing, predictive insights, and context-aware automation without redesigning existing integrations. Logic Apps adapts to business and regulatory needs, running fully managed in Azure, [hybrid via Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://aka.ms/lahybrid), or evaluated for [air-gapped environments](https://aka.ms/ladisconnected).\n\nThroughout this lifecycle transition, customers can continue to rely on the BizTalk investments they have made while moving toward a platform ready for the next decade of integration and AI-driven business.\n\n#### **Charting Your Modernization Path**\n\nMicrosoft remains fully committed to supporting customers through this transition. We recognize that BizTalk systems support highly customized and mission-critical business operations. Modernization requires time, planning, and precision. We hope to provide:\n\n- Proven guidance and recommended design patterns\n- A growing ecosystem of tooling supporting artifact reuse\n- Unified Support engagements for deep migration assistance\n- A strong partner ecosystem specializing in BizTalk modernization\n- Potential incentive programs to help facilitate migration for eligible customers (details forthcoming)\n- Customers can take a phased approach — starting with new workloads while incrementally modernizing existing BizTalk deployments.\n\n#### **We’re Here to Help**\n\nMigration resources are available today:\n\n- Overview: [https://aka.ms/btmig](https://aka.ms/btmig)\n- Best practices: [https://aka.ms/BizTalkServerMigrationResources](https://aka.ms/BizTalkServerMigrationResources)\n- Video series: [https://aka.ms/btmigvideo](https://aka.ms/btmigvideo)\n- Feature request survey: [https://aka.ms/logicappsneeds](https://aka.ms/logicappsneeds)\n\nWe encourage customers to engage their Microsoft accounts team early to assess readiness, identify modernization opportunities, and explore assistance programs.\n\n#### **Your Modernization Journey Starts Now**\n\nBizTalk Server has played a foundational role in enterprise integration success for more than two decades. As you plan ahead, Microsoft is here to partner with you every step of the way, ensuring operational continuity today while unlocking innovation tomorrow.\n\nTo begin your transition, please contact your Microsoft account team or visit our [migration hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/biztalk-server-migration-overview).\n\nThank you for your continued trust in Microsoft and BizTalk Server. We look forward to partnering closely with you as you plan the future of your integration platforms.\n\n#### **Frequently Asked Questions**\n\n###### **Do I need to migrate now?**\nNo. BizTalk Server 2020 is fully supported through April 11, 2028, with paid Extended Support available through April 9, 2030, for non-security hotfixes. CSS will continue providing their typical support. You have a long and predictable runway to plan your transition.\n\n###### **Will there be a new BizTalk Server version?**\nNo. BizTalk Server 2020 is the final version of the product.\n\n###### **What happens after April 9, 2030?**\nBizTalk Server will reach End of Support, and security updates or technical assistance will no longer be provided. Workloads will continue running but without Microsoft servicing.\n\n###### **Is paid support available past 2028?**\nYes. Paid extended support will be available through April 2030 for BizTalk Server 2020 customers looking for non-security hotfixes.

More information of the Hybrid deployment model here: [https://aka.ms/lahybrid](https://aka.ms/lahybrid).\n\n###### **Does modernization unlock AI capabilities?**\nYes. Logic Apps enables AI-driven automations through [Agent Loop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/agent-workflows-concepts?tabs=consumption), improving routing, decisioning, and operational intelligence.\n\n###### **Where do I get planning support?**\nYour Microsoft account team can assist with assessment and planning.
