Together with the launch of [Microsoft Agent Factory](https://aka.ms/Microsoft-Agent-Factory-Blog), organizations now have a unified program to build, deploy, and manage agents powered by these IQs.\n\nHowever, deploying advanced agents can still be complicated by fragmented procurement, unpredictable budgets, and governance challenges. Organizations often have to choose between platforms like [Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/) and [Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/try-copilot-chat?ccac=copilotchat&amp;ef_id=_k_5a469f6e1c0016cbc811f67997b23cb1_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmml35ws9mz_SEM__k_5a469f6e1c0016cbc811f67997b23cb1_k_&amp;msclkid=5a469f6e1c0016cbc811f67997b23cb1). Each has unique strengths but using just one limits flexibility and prevents organizations from building truly optimized agents.\n\n**[Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan (P3)](https://aka.ms/Microsoft-Agent-P3-Docs)** is designed to reduce the friction of this challenge. By unifying access to agentic services across both Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Studio, Microsoft Agent P3 empowers organizations to harness the full potential of the IQ layer thus removing barriers and unlocking the value of truly intelligent, context-driven agents.\n\n# What is Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan and how to does it work?\n\n- Microsoft Agent P3 is a one-year pay-upfront option.\n- Customers commit upfront to a lump-sum pool of Agent Commit Units (ACU) that can be used at any time during the one-year term.\n- Every time you consume eligible services within Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Credits\\* enabled agentic services, the ACUs are automatically drawn down from your P3 balance.\n- If you use up your balance before the year ends, you can add another P3 plan or switch to pay-as-you-go.\n- If you don’t use all your credits by the end of the year, the remaining balance expires.\n\n# Pricing\\*\n\n\\*Pricing as of November 2025, subject to change.\n\n\\*\\*Example if Microsoft Copilot Studio generates a retail cost of $100 based on Copilot Credit and Microsoft Foundry usage, then 100 Agent CUs (ACUs) are consumed.\n\n# What is covered by the Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan?\n\n\\* List as of November 2025, subject to change\n\n\\*\\* Currently in Private Preview\n\n\\*\\*\\* Microsoft reserves the right to update Copilot Credit eligible products\n\n# Customer Example\n\nSuppose a customer expects to consume 1,500,000 Copilot Credit with custom agents created in Microsoft Copilot Studio. Assuming the pay-as-you-go rate for Copilot Credit to be $0.01, then at the pay-as-you-go rate, this will cost $15,000.\n\nIn addition, if they are using 5000 [Microsoft Foundry Provisioned Throughput Units (PTU)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/provisioned-throughput?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-foundry%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&amp;view=foundry-classic&amp;tabs=global-ptum) and assuming the pay-as-you-go rate for PTU to be $1, then at the pay-as-you-go rate, this will cost $5,000.\n\nBy purchasing Tier 1 (20,000 ACUs) Microsoft Agent P3 at the cost of $19,000, it will give a 5% saving compared to the pay-as-you-go rate for the same usage.\n\n# How to purchase a Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan?\n\n- Sign in to the Azure portal →Reservations → + Add → Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan.\n- Select your subscription and scope\n- Choose your tier and complete payment.\n\n# What sets Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan apart?\n\nAt the heart of Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan are four pillars that redefine how organizations consume AI services:\n\n1. **One Plan:** A single offer that spans Foundry and Copilot Credits \\* enabled agentic services.
