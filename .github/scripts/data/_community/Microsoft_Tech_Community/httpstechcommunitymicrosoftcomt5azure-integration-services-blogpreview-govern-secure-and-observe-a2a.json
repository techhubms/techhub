  "Description": "Today, we’re announcing the **preview support for A2A (Agent2Agent) APIs in Azure API Management**. With this capability, organizations can now manage and govern **agent APIs alongside AI model APIs, Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, and traditional APIs** such as REST, SOAP, GraphQL, WebSocket, and gRPC — all within a single, consistent API management plane.\n\n# **Extending API Governance into the Agentic Ecosystem**\n\nAs organizations adopt agentic systems, the need for **consistent governance, security, and observability** grows. With A2A API support, Azure API Management enables you to extend established API practices into the agentic world — ensuring secure access, consistent policy enforcement, and complete visibility for AI agents.\n\nA2A APIs in Azure API Management:\n\n- Mediate **JSON-RPC runtime operations** with policy support\n- Expose and manage **agent cards** for users, clients, or other agents\n- Support **OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions** when logging traces to Application Insights — including \"gen\\_ai.agent.id\" and \"gen\\_ai.agent.name\" attributes\n\n![]()\n\n# **How It Works**\n\nWhen you import an A2A API, API Management mediates runtime calls to your agent backend (JSON-RPC only) and exposes the agent card as an operation within the same API. The agent card is transformed automatically to represent the A2A API managed by API Management — with the hostname replaced by API Management’s gateway address, security schemes converted to authentication configured in API Management, and unsupported interfaces removed.\n\nWhen integrated with Application Insights, API Management enriches traces with GenAI-compliant telemetry attributes — allowing easy identification of the agent and deep correlation between API and agent execution traces for monitoring and debugging.\n\n# **Try It Out**\n\nTo import an A2A API:\n\n1. Navigate to the **APIs** page in the Azure portal and select the **A2A Agent** tile.\n2. Enter your agent card URL. If accessible, the portal will automatically populate relevant settings.\n3. Configure the remaining properties, such as API path in API Management.\n\nThis functionality is currently available only in v2 tiers of API Management and it will continue to roll out to all tiers in the coming months.\n\n# **Start Managing Your Agent APIs**\n\nWith A2A support in Azure API Management, you can now bring agent APIs under the same governance and security umbrella as your existing APIs — strengthening control, security, and observability across your AI and API ecosystems.\n\n[Learn more about A2A API support in Azure API Management](https://aka.ms/apimdocs/a2a-agent-api).",
