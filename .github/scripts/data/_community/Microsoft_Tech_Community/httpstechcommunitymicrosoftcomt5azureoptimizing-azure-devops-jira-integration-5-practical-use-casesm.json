  "Description": "Many teams rely on **Azure DevOps (ADO)** for development and **Jira** for project or product management. While each tool is powerful on its own, things often get messy when work items, statuses, and updates live in separate systems.\n\nIntegrating the two platforms can remove a lot of friction. Below are six common use cases I have seen from real teams, with concrete problems and solutions to make the connection between Jira and Azure DevOps work smoothly.\n\n## 1. Keeping User Stories and Bugs in Sync\n\n- **Challenge**: Teams use Jira for user requests and Azure DevOps for development tasks. Manually updating both systems is tedious and error-prone.\n- **Solution**: Enable **two-way synchronization** so that changes in Jira automatically reflect in Azure DevOps and vice versa (including comments and status updates). This keeps bugs and stories aligned without duplicate work.\n\n***‚ÄúBefore we integrated Jira with Aure DevOps, I spent too much time manually updating task statuses in both systems. Now, with the automatic sync, my team is focused on actual coding work instead of managing project statuses across platforms.‚Äù***\n\n‚Äî **DevOps Engineer**\n\n## 2. One-Way Sync for Project Management‚ÄìFirst Teams\n\n- **Challenge**: Some organizations plan and track everything in Jira but manage code exclusively in Azure DevOps. Developers only need the essentials pushed across.\n- **Solution**: Use a **one-way sync** from Jira ‚Üí Azure DevOps to bring over metadata like titles, statuses, sprints, and due dates. Developers see the context they need without cluttering both systems with manual updates.\n\n***‚ÄúWe rely on Jira for all project planning and management, but the developers need a clean workspace in Azure DevOps. A one-way sync from Jira to ADO helps us keep things efficient and ensures developers always have the latest information without double entry.‚Äù*** ‚Äî **Product Owner**\n\n## 3. Creating Jira Tickets from Azure DevOps Tasks or Bugs\n\n- **Challenge**: External partners or stakeholders may only work in Jira Service Management to manage tickets. Developers in Azure DevOps often need their work mirrored for transparency.\n- **Solution**: Configure **automated ticket creation** in Jira when certain ADO tasks are tagged. Both teams can track progress in their preferred tool without duplicating effort.\n\n***‚ÄúWe use Azure DevOps internally, but our external stakeholders only work in Jira. Automating the creation of Jira tickets based on Azure DevOps tasks or bugs has made collaboration seamless and ensured no work is lost in translation.‚Äù*** ‚Äî **DevOps Lead**\n\n## 4. Syncing Epics, Features, and Work Items\n\n- **Challenge**: High-level epics might live in Jira, while features and tasks are managed in Azure DevOps. Without integration, visibility across systems is fragmented.\n- **Solution**: Sync **epics and features** so Jira provides portfolio-level visibility, while Azure DevOps remains the system of record for detailed development work. This keeps roadmaps and execution aligned.\n\n***‚ÄúTracking epics in Jira while managing the technical work in Azure DevOps used to cause us to lose visibility. Now, everything from high-level epics to individual tasks is in sync, so we always know where we stand.‚Äù*** ‚Äî **Azure DevOps Product Manager**\n\n## 5. Managing Multiple Jira Projects with One Azure DevOps Project\n\n- **Challenge**: Large organizations often run multiple Jira projects (by teams or business units) but only one Azure DevOPs project for development. Syncing everything consistently is tough.\n- **Solution**: Map **multiple Jira projects to a single Azure DevOps project**, syncing only the key data (titles, statuses, sprints, custom fields). This creates a unified development view without losing project-specific details.\n\n***‚ÄúWe have multiple teams using different Jira projects, but we consolidate all development work into a single Azure DevOps project. Syncing across these platforms used to be a nightmare, but now everything stays aligned, and we‚Äôre able to track all initiatives in one place.‚Äù*** ‚Äî **Azure DevOps Engineer**\n\nüí¨ Have you integrated Jira with Azure DevOps in your team? What worked well, and what challenges did you run into?",
