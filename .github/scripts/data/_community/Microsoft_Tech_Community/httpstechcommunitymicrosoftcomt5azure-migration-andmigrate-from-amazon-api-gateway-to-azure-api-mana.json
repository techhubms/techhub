  "Description": "For teams moving ***from* Amazon API Gateway *to* Azure API Management**, we've published a detailed migration guide that addresses the technical considerations and implementation steps for a successful transition: [Migrate Amazon API Gateway to Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/migrate-amazon-api-gateway-to-api-management).\n\nThe guide focuses on helping AWS users map their existing API Gateway configurations to equivalent Azure API Management capabilities while highlighting architectural differences and best practices for the Azure platform.\n\n## **What the guide covers:**\n\n**✅ Detailed feature mapping**\n\nWe provide extensive mapping tables across three categories: infrastructure capabilities, API workloads, and API configurations. For example, you'll find mappings for network isolation (VPC endpoints to virtual networks), WAF integration, custom domains, and observability (CloudWatch to Azure Monitor). For workloads, the guide addresses Lambda proxy integrations, REST APIs, and HTTP APIs. Configuration mappings include stage variables, caching, throttling, CORS, and authentication methods. Where direct equivalents don't exist, the guide explains workarounds and alternative approaches—for example, handling Lambda authorizers in an Azure environment or replicating edge-optimized endpoints using multi-region deployments.\n\n**✅ Assessment and preparation**\n\nBefore you touch any infrastructure, the guide walks you through a systematic assessment and preparation process. This includes evaluating your current deployment against Azure capabilities, identifying services to retain or replace, documenting API configurations, and establishing performance baselines. The guide emphasizes exporting OpenAPI specifications, capturing authentication flows, and understanding data flows—all critical inputs for migration planning.\n\n**✅ Migration and validation**\n\nWe outline a phased migration approach that minimizes risk and downtime. Key phases include selecting an appropriate API Management service tier, planning network topology, configuring parallel environments, validating configurations, and executing DNS cutover. The guide also covers post-migration optimization and continuous improvement practices.\n\n**✅ Architecture-focused example**\n\nTo provide context, the guide shows you a sample migration scenario: a healthcare organization with a multi-backend API system proxied through Amazon API Gateway. The original architecture includes Cognito authentication, WAF filtering, Lambda functions, EC2 instances, and an EKS cluster. The Azure equivalent architecture shows how to achieve comparable functionality using Microsoft Entra ID, Azure Application Gateway with WAF, Azure Functions, AKS, and private endpoints—all while maintaining network isolation and monitoring capabilities.\n\n#### **More resources**\n\nWhile this guide focuses on API Management, many organizations are migrating multiple workload types from AWS to Azure. The [Azure Migration Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/migration/) provides comprehensive guidance for migrating various components, including compute, databases, storage, and applications.\n\nExplore the full[migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/migrate-amazon-api-gateway-to-api-management) on Microsoft Learn and let us know how it helps you in your migration journey!",
