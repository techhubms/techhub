Microsoft is tackling the physical limits of traditional networking head-on. From pioneering research in [***microLED***](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/breaking-the-networking-wall-in-ai-infrastructure/?msockid=0a5bdbaad5dd6fde1745c96cd4be6ebf) technologies to deploying Hollow Core Fiber (HCF) at global scale, **Microsoft is reimagining connectivity to power the next era of cloud networking**.\n\nAzure’s HCF journey has been one of relentless innovation, collaboration, and a vision to redefine the physical layer of the cloud. Microsoft’s HCF, based on the proprietary Double Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fiber (DNANF) design, delivers up to **47% faster data transmission** and approximately **33% lower latency** compared to conventional Single Mode Fiber (SMF), bringing significant advantages to the network that powers Azure.\n\nToday, Microsoft is announcing a major milestone: the **industrial scale-up of HCF production**, powered by new strategic manufacturing collaborations with **Corning Incorporated (Corning)** and **Heraeus Covantics (Heraeus)**. These collaborations will enable Azure to increase the global fiber production of HCF to meet the demands of the growing network infrastructure, advancing the performance and reliability customers expect for cloud and AI workloads.\n\n![]()***Figure 1: Examples of HCF during the manufacturing process***\n\n## **Real-world benefits for Azure customers**\n\nSince 2023, Microsoft has deployed HCF across multiple Azure regions, with production links meeting performance and reliability targets. As manufacturing scales, Azure plans to expand deployment of the **full end-to-end HCF network solution** to help increase capacity, resiliency, and speed for customers, with the potential to set new benchmarks for **latency and efficiency** in fiber infrastructure.\n\n#### **Why it matters**\n\nMicrosoft’s proprietary HCF design brings the following improvements for Azure customers:\n\n- **Increased data transmission** speeds with up to 33% lower latency.\n- **Enhanced signal performance** that improves data transmission quality for customers.\n- **Improved optical efficiency** resulting in higher bandwidth rates compared to conventional fiber.\n\n#### **How Microsoft is making it possible**\n\nTo operationalize HCF across Azure with production grade performance, Microsoft is:\n\n- **Deploying a standardized HCF solution** with end-to-end systems and components for operational efficiency, streamlined network management, and reliable connectivity across Azure’s infrastructure.\n- **Ensuring interoperability** with standard SMF environments, enabling seamless integration with existing optical infrastructure in the network for faster deployment and scalable growth.\n- **Creating a multinational production** supply chain to scale next generation fiber production, ensuring the volumes and speed to market needed for widespread HCF deployment across the Azure network.\n\n## **Scaling up and out**\n\nWith **Corning and Heraeus as Microsoft’s first HCF manufacturing collaborators**, Azure plans to accelerate deployment to meet surging demand for high-performance connectivity. These collaborations underscore Microsoft’s commitment to **enhancing its global infrastructure** and delivering a reliable customer experience. They also reinforce Azure’s continued investment in deploying HCF, with a vision for this technology to potentially set the global benchmark for **high-capacity fiber innovation**.\n\n> >\n> *“* *This milestone marks a new chapter in reimagining the cloud’s physical layer.* *Our collaborations with Corning and Heraeus establish a resilient, global HCF supply chain so Azure can deliver a standardized, world-class customer experience with ultra-low latency and high reliability for modern AI and cloud workloads.”* **- Jamie Gaudette, Partner Cloud Network Engineering Manager at Microsoft**\n> >\n\n![]()***Figure 2: HCF winding onto a spool during the manufacturing process***\n\nTo scale HCF production, Microsoft will utilize Corning’s established U.S. facilities, while Heraeus will produce out of its sites in both Europe and the U.S.\n\n> >\n> \"*Corning is excited to expand our longtime collaboration with Microsoft, leveraging Corning’s fiber and cable manufacturing facilities in North Carolina to accelerate the production of Microsoft's Hollow Core Fiber.* *This collaboration not only strengthens our existing relationship but also underscores our commitment to advancing U.S. leadership in AI innovation and infrastructure.
