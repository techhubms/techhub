  "Description": "The future of AI blog series is an evolving collection of posts from the AI Futures team in collaboration with subject matter experts across Microsoft. In this series, we explore tools and technologies that will drive the next generation of AI. Explore more at: [https://aka.ms/the-future-of-ai](https://aka.ms/the-future-of-ai)\n\nWe rarely build products from scratch. Even our most structured work carries assumptions- invisible scaffolding that shapes what we call valuable, usable, or intuitive. These assumptions aren’t all bad; they’re necessary for functioning in a world of overwhelming information and noise. But they often go unexamined.\n\nIn my role as a UX Engineer on the Azure AI Foundry product design team, I create tools and processes to empower my teammates’ best work. I saw an opportunity to create an agent using Copilot Studio, powered by Azure AI Foundry, to investigate the assumptions that were baked into my team's product thinking. This agent, which I'm calling Lacuna, began as an experiment in noticing.\n\nA product artifact, from a quickly dashed-off Jira ticket to a buttoned-up PRD, is a snapshot of belief. These beliefs can be things like:\n\n- \"We believe our success metric reflects real value\"\n\n- \"We believe everyone interprets this word the same way\"\n\n- \"We believe our product structure (which matches our org structure) makes sense to outsiders\"\n\n- \"We believe our users want this feature\"\n\nThese beliefs usually sneak in. They’re baked in, not called out. And once decisions harden into roadmaps and code, we rarely go back to question them.\n\nI became curious about how a large language model (LLM), with its outsider stance and lack of organizational baggage, could help reveal the biases we don’t notice in ourselves. It doesn’t share our assumptions or internal context, and that distance can be surprisingly useful.\n\nThat’s what led to Lacuna, built during a team hackathon. With Copilot Studio, I authored a custom prompt and file upload interface that my teammates can use to pause the pattern of human biases, with minimal effort and overhead. To use Lacuna in Microsoft Teams, you upload or link a product doc— a requirements list, a vision deck, a strategy memo — and it surfaces the assumptions it sees. Assumptions can be explicit or implied statements about customer needs, behaviors, contexts, and constraints. To find these assumptions, Lacuna looks for linguistic signals: speculative verbs, confident declarations, vague nouns. Then it assesses those assumptions using three lenses, which are borrowed from design risk analysis:\n\n- Impact – What breaks if this is wrong?\n\n- Confidence – How strong is the evidence given?\n\n- Reversibility – How costly is it to pivot?\n\nThe agent outputs a list of assumptions that are ranked by risk, i.e. the potential impact the assumption has on product success if it proves false. It then suggests ways to mitigate risk by recommending lightweight, evidence‑generating activities (surveys, interviews, A/B tests, telemetry analysis, etc.) best suited to validating or invalidating the assumption. Lacuna is meant to be a curious collaborator, not a critic. It asks:\n\n\"What if this isn’t true? How might we find out more?\"\n\nProduct work is full of cognitive bias: confirmation, projection, and sometimes overconfidence. Lacuna doesn’t fix that, but it can surface these items for review and consideration. Seeing bias is a first step toward navigating it. The conversational agent doesn't solve everything- it doesn't provide the resources to run further testing, and it doesn't push deadlines to create time to complete the work; but, it helps us become more aware of the assumptions that underpin our product ideas and target the most impactful ways to mitigate risk.\n\nUsing Lacuna has been an experiment in partnering with an LLM to illuminate our human perspective. It's part of an ongoing exploration for me:\n\n- Can agents prompt epistemic humility?\n\n- Can LLM tools foster reflection, not just output?\n\n- What new insights emerge when documents become conversations rather than static artifacts?\n\nWe’re all guessing. We might as well get better at noticing how.\n\n**Now it’s your turn to create with Azure AI Foundry**\n\n- Get started with [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/), and jump directly into [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vscode-ai-foundry)\n\n- Download the [Azure AI Foundry SDK](https://aka.ms/aifoundrysdk)\n\n- Take the [Azure AI Foundry learn courses](https://aka.ms/CreateAgenticAISolutions)\n\n- Review the [Azure AI Foundry documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/)\n\n- Keep the conversation going in [GitHub](https://aka.ms/azureaifoundry/forum) and [Discord](https://aka.ms/azureaifoundry/discord)\n\n- Get started with [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/)\n\n- Review the [Copilot Studio documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot-studio/requirements-messages-management)",
