  "EnhancedContent": "Hi there.\n\nThe scenario is this: I set a custom wallpaper off my data partition that's encrypted by Bitlocker, I restart the laptop and of course the drive is then locked. Then, after a while my wallpaper completely disappears and the desktop turns black. But weirdly sometimes it comes back after a certain time\n\nI done a test where I copied an image to the main drive, set it as the wallpaper, deleted it and sure enough the same thing happened. Conversely if I don't delete it the wallpaper stays as normal. What is going on with that? It's like Windows needs the original image to keep updating the desktop. But I know windows caches any set wallpaper into file 'TranscodedWallpaper' - and I have checked this file and it seems fine.\n\nI have recently got a new laptop and when I realised this was happening I thought it could've been some kind of malware or some kind of software conflict so I took the time to reinstall Windows yet it's still happening. I can tell that it's going to turn black because when I go into settings the image of my wallpaper doesn't appear in the screen image at the top and also when you mouse over desktop icons a black square appears around them. But weirdly this doesn't seem to happen straight away, after I first log into Windows the wallpaper is there as normal and everythings fine, then it takes around 10~20 minutes before the wallpapers vanishes or sooner if the desktop is refreshed for any reason\n\nCan anybody reproduce this? It seems like a bug to me because I have never had this issue prior - whatever wallpaper I set it would simply stay put, accessible or not.",
