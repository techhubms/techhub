  "Description": "Enterprises today need more than speed they need confidence. Migration projects often stall because of complexity, fragmented tools, and unclear ROI. With Migration Agent in Azure Copilot, we’re changing that equation. This new capability brings AI-driven intelligence to every stage of migration and modernization, helping you move from discovery to execution in hours, not weeks. and completing the journey with confidence.\n\nMigration is no longer just about moving workloads. It’s about unlocking innovation, reducing costs, and modernizing applications to stay competitive. Yet, many organizations struggle with lengthy assessments, manual landing zone setup, and database modernization challenges. Migration Agent addresses these pain points head-on, combining automation with actionable insights so you can accelerate outcomes without compromising governance or security.\n\n## Watch it in action\n\n| **Rehost from VMWare to Azure with Migration Agent** | **Modernize applications with Migration Agent and GitHub Copilot** | | --- | --- |\n\nMigration Agent, now integrated into Azure Copilot, introduces three key capabilities designed to simplify and speed up your migration journey:\n\n##### **Discovery to ROI analysis in hours**\n\nMigration planning shouldn’t take weeks. With the Migration Agent, AI-powered discovery automatically maps your on-premises estate, infrastructure, databases, and applications without manual effort. Within a few hours, you get a tailored business case that includes migration costs, projected savings, and ROI, all calculated from your real usage. Right-sizing recommendations ensure Azure targets fit your performance and budget, while modernization guidance highlights where you can refactor or optimize for cloud-native benefits.\n\n##### **Landing Zone setup in hours**\n\nSetting up a secure, compliant Azure environment is now a matter of hours, not weeks or months. The agent automates landing zone creation, aligning with Microsoft’s Cloud Adoption Framework. Networking, identity, policies, and resource organization are configured for you, reducing manual steps and risk. Structured migration waves let you sequence workloads for predictable execution, with built-in progress tracking and rollback options. Every configuration is validated against best practices, so you can move forward with confidence.\n\n##### **Modernize OSS Databases and Linux seamlessly**\n\nModern workloads demand modern support. Azure Migration Agent now covers the latest Linux distributions: RHEL 9.5, Rocky Linux 9.5, Ubuntu 24.04, Alma Linux 9.5 ensuring compatibility from day one. Integrated assessment and migration for PostgreSQL and MySQL databases means discovery, readiness checks, and modernization steps are consolidated into a single workflow. Actionable recommendations help you upgrade, consolidate, and tune databases, unlocking cloud-native features and cost efficiencies.\n\n## How it works\n\nMigration Agent operates within Azure Copilot, your AI-powered assistant for cloud operations. It guides you through:\n\n- Discovery and assessment using AI models.\n- Business case generation with ROI insights tailored to your environment.\n- Landing zone deployment aligned with governance best practices.\n- Modernization workflows for databases and applications all in a single experience.\n\nThis integration means you’re not juggling multiple tools or scripts. Instead, you have one intelligent interface that learns from your environment and adapts recommendations to your goals.\n\n## Get Started Today\n\nWith Migration Agent in Azure Copilot, you can move faster, modernize smarter, and realize value sooner. Start today and transform migration from a challenge into a competitive advantage.\n\n[Sign up](https://aka.ms/Migrate/AMA) for early access to Migration Agent in Azure Copilot.\n\nLearn more about [Azure Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/migration) and for expert migration help, please try [Azure Accelerate.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/azure-accelerate/)",
