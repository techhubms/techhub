  "EnhancedContent": "As an Azure Administrator responsible for managing extensive cloud infrastructure, I rely heavily on this client to access multiple Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environments. My current responsibilities involve managing a large and growing pool of AVDs, each providing access to a specific environment (e.g., development, staging, production, or customer-specific resources).\n\nCurrently, I have no easy or efficient way to look up the relevant AVD within the client interface. The lack of a search bar forces me to manually scroll through long lists of connection icons and names whenever I need to switch contexts. This process is time-consuming, prone to error, and significantly hinders my productivity, especially during time-sensitive administrative tasks or troubleshooting efforts.\n\nImplementing a simple, functional search bar would drastically improve the user experience for administrators like myself by providing immediate access to the required virtual desktop connection.",
