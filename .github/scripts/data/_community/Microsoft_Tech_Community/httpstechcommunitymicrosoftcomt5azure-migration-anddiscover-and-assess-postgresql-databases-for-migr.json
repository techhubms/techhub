  "EnhancedContent": "## Plan the migration of your PostgreSQL Server deployments with Azure PostgreSQL assessment in Azure Migrate (Public Preview)\n\n###### **Discover and Assess PostgreSQL Databases at Scale with Azure Migrate (Preview)**\n\nCloud migration projects can be complex, and it can be difficult to determine where to begin, especially when you host different technology workloads and wish to migrate as well as modernize your workloads on Azure VM and PaaS solutions respectively. Planning migrations without full visibility into your IT estate—including the applications and databases powering your workloads—can lead to unexpected delays, cost overruns, or performance issues.\n\nAt Microsoft, we're committed to helping you migrate with confidence by offering an integrated **discovery, assessment, and migration capabilities** for all your key workloads and applications through **Azure Migrate**.\n\nIn this blog post, we’re excited to announce the public preview of unified, agentless, and at-scale **discovery and assessment of PostgreSQL databases** using Azure Migrate. With this new capability, you can create a unified view of your entire IT estate, across Windows, Linux, ASP.NET applications running on IIS webserver, Java web application, databases such as SQL Server, MySQL server and now PostgreSQL server running in your VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V or Physical/ Bare-metal server powered datacenter or IaaS services of public clouds such as AWS EC2, Azure VM, etc.\n\n###### **Key Capabilities**\n\nWith this feature, you can:\n\n- **Discover your on-premises PostgreSQL deployments** agentlessly, using lightweight Azure Migrate appliance—no need to install agents on each host\n- **Identify installed applications** and software running on your server.\n- **Use agentless dependency mapping to visualize application tiers and interdependent workloads** that connect to your PostgreSQL servers—helping ensure that no workload is left behind during migration.\n- **Determine** configuration details****such as **support status,** **PostgreSQL version, extensions, max server memory**\n- **Tag** related **workloads** together such as **define application** etc.\n- **Assess** the **readiness** of PostgreSQL server for desired migration target, **including configuration compatibility and supported extensions** for\n- Modernize to Azure database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server (PaaS)\n- Migration to Azure VM (IaaS)\n- Determine **Azure compute SKU, storage SKU, its respective cost, migration blockers and migration guidance** for each feasible migration target based on desired Azure region, environment, cost savings options and target service tier.\n\n**Preview discovery support**\n\nThe preview supports discovery of PostgreSQL instances and databases (community edition only) running on all versions, from version 6 to version 18.  Only community edition is currently supported.  Additionally, as indicated in the diagram, discovery of configuration and performance data is a continuous process i.e., the discovered inventory is refreshed periodically, thereby enabling you to visualize the most updated details of your environment.\n\n**Post Assessment**\n\nOnce you have completed your PostgreSQL assessment and identified the desired targets in Azure, you can leverage [Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/database-migration/)to migrate to Azure database for PostgreSQL, or [Azure Migrate: Migration and Modernization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/server-migrate-overview?view=migrate) tool from Azure Migrate to migrate to Azure VMs.\n\nMigrating to Azure can help you realize substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies. Azure enables you to move efficiently and with high confidence through a mix of services like Azure Migrate, best practice guides, and programs. Once in the cloud, you can scale on-demand to meet your business needs.\n\nIf you intend to optimize your Azure spend, you can use the Physical/ Bare-metal stack of Azure Migrate to discover PostgreSQL Servers running on Azure VM, and subsequently assess them for migration/ modernization to Azure database for PostgreSQL.\n\n**Get started today**\n\n1.
