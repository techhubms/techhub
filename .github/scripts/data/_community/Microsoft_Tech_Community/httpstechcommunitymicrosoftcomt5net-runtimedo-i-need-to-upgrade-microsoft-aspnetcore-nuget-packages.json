  "EnhancedContent": "Hi,\n\nI'm encountering an issue with our SCA (Software Composition Analysis) scan, which reports several known vulnerabilities in .NET Core components. Specifically, the scan detects that the following packages are still on version **8.0.0**, which are flagged as vulnerable:\n\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Connections.Client\n- Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client\n\nThe scanner recommends upgrading these packages to version **8.0.15** to resolve the issues.\n\nTo address this, I upgraded the .NET Runtime on our environment to version **8.0.15**. However, the SCA scan still reports the same vulnerabilities, indicating that the vulnerable component versions have not changed.\n\nMy question is: **Do I also need to manually upgrade the corresponding NuGet package versions in the project to 8.0.15, or is upgrading the .NET Runtime alone sufficient to ensure these components are updated as well?**\n\nAny clarification would be appreciated. Thank you!",
