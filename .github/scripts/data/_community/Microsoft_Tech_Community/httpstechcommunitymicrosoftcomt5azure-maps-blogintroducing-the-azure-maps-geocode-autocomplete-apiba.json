  "Description": "We’re thrilled to unveil the **Azure Maps Geocode Autocomplete API**, a powerful REST service designed to modernize and elevate autocomplete capabilities across Microsoft’s mapping platforms.\n\n#### **Why This API Matters**\n\nThe Geocode Autocomplete API is the replacement solution for the **Bing Maps Autosuggest REST API**, following the **deprecation of Bing Maps Enterprise**. It’s built to meet the growing demand for intelligent, real-time location suggestions in applications such as:\n\n- Store locators\n- Rideshare and dispatching platforms\n- Form autofill and address entry\n- Web UIs requiring location input\n- Real estate search and delivery services\n\n#### **What It Can Do**\n\nThe Geocode Autocomplete API is designed to deliver fast, relevant, and structured suggestions as users type. Key capabilities include:\n\n- **Entity Suggestions**: Supports both **Place** (e.g., geography, administrative district, populated places, landmarks, postal codes) and **Address** (e.g., roads, point addresses) entities.\n- **Ranking**: Results can be ranked based on **entity popularity**, **user location (coordinates)**, and **bounding box (bbox)**.\n- **Structured Output**: Returns suggestions with structured address formats, making integration seamless.\n- **Multilingual Support**: Set up query language preferences via the Accept-Language parameter.\n- **Flexible Filtering**: You can refine suggestions by specifying a **country or region** using countryRegion, or by targeting a specific **entity subtype** using resultType. This allows you to extract entities with precise categorization—for example, you can filter results to return only **postal codes** to match the needs of a location-based selection input in your web application.\n\n#### **How to Use It**\n\nThe Geocode Autocomplete API is accessed via the following endpoint:\n\n> >\n> https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/geocode:autocomplete\n> >\n\nThis endpoint provides autocomplete-style suggestions for addresses and places. Developers can further issue geocode service with the selected/ideal entity as query to locate the entity on map, which is a common scenario for producing interactive mapping experiences.\n\n**Example: Autocomplete for a Place Entity**\n\n- GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/geocode:autocomplete\n?api-version=2025-06-01-preview &subscription-key={YourAzureMapsKey} &query=new yo &countryRegion=US\n\nThis request returns structured suggestions for the partial input “new yo,” helping users quickly find places like New York City.\n\n**Example: Autocomplete for an Address Entity**\n- GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/search/geocode:autocomplete\n?api-version=2025-06-01-preview &subscription-key={YourAzureMapsKey} &query=10 Downing st &countryRegion=GB\n\nThis request returns structured address suggestions for 10 Downing Street, categorized as an Address entity.\n\n**Example: Integrate with Web Application**\n\n![]()![]()Below sample shows user enter query and autocomplete service provide a series of suggestions based on user query and user location.\n\n#### **Ready to Build Smarter Location Experiences?**\n\nWhether you're powering a store locator, enhancing address entry, or building a dynamic dispatch system, the new Geocode Autocomplete API gives you the precision, flexibility, and performance needed to deliver seamless location intelligence.
