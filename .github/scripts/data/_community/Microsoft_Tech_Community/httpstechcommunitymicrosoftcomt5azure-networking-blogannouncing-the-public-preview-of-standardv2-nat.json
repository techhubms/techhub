  "Description": "In today’s rapidly changing digital landscape, organizations are innovating faster and delivering cloud native experiences at global scale. With this acceleration comes higher expectations: applications must remain always available. An outage in a single availability zone can have a ripple effect on application performance, user experience, and business continuity. To safeguard against zone outages, making your cloud architecture zone resilient isn't an option—it’s a necessity.\n\nA key part of any resilient design is ensuring reliable outbound connectivity. Azure NAT Gateway is a fully managed network address translation service that provides highly scalable and secure internet connectivity for resources inside your virtual networks.\n\nWe’re excited to announce the public preview of the **StandardV2 SKU NAT Gateway**, an evolution of Azure NAT Gateway built for the next generation of scale, performance, and resiliency. StandardV2 NAT Gateway delivers **zone redundancy**, **enhanced data processing limits**, **IPv6 support**, and **flow logs** all **at** **the same price as the Standard SKU NAT Gateway**.\n\nThis release also marks the public preview of **StandardV2 SKU public IP addresses and prefixes**. A new SKU of public IPs that must be used with StandardV2 NAT Gateway. In combination, StandardV2 IPs provide high-throughput connectivity to support demanding workloads.\n\n![]()StandardV2 NAT Gateway is zone resilient and provides dual-stack connectivity.\n\n## What’s new in StandardV2 NAT Gateway\n\n### Zone redundancy\n\nStandardV2 NAT Gateway is zone-redundant by default in regions with availability zones. Deployed as a single resource operating across multiple zones, StandardV2 NAT Gateway ensures outbound connectivity even if one zone becomes unavailable.\n\n![]()StandardV2 NAT Gateway spans across multiple availability zones in a region.\n\nFor example, a virtual machine in zone 2 connects outbound from zones 1, 2, or 3 through a StandardV2 NAT Gateway (as shown in the figure). If zone 1 experiences an outage, existing connections in that zone may fail, but new connections will seamlessly flow through zones 2 and 3—keeping your applications online and resilient. All existing connections through zones 2 and 3 will persist. To learn more, see [StandardV2 NAT Gateway zone-redundancy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-availability-zones#standardv2-sku-nat-gateway-zone-redundant).\n\n![]()In zone down scenarios, new connections flow through the remaining healthy zones with StandardV2 NAT Gateway.\n\nThis kind of resiliency is essential for any critical workload to ensure high availability. Whether you’re a global SaaS provider that needs to maintain service continuity for your customers during zonal outages or an e-commerce platform that needs to ensure high availability during peak shopping seasons, StandardV2 NAT Gateway can help you achieve greater protection against zonal outages.\n\n### Higher performance\n\nStandardV2 doubles the performance of the Standard SKU, supporting up to 100 Gbps throughput and 10 million packets per second. These enhanced data processing limits are ideal for data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications requiring consistent, high-throughput outbound access to the internet. For more information, see [StandardV2 NAT Gateway performance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-gateway-resource#performance).\n\n### StandardV2 public IPs\n\nAlongside NAT Gateway, StandardV2 public IP Addresses and Prefixes are now available in public preview. StandardV2 SKU public IPs are a new offering of public IPs that must be used with StandardV2 NAT Gateway to provide outbound connectivity. Standard SKU public IPs are not compatible with StandardV2 NAT Gateway. See [how to deploy StandardV2 public IPs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/create-public-ip-portal#create-a-standardv2-sku-public-ip-address).\n\n### IPv6 (dual-stack) support\n\nStandardV2 NAT Gateway now supports dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6) connectivity, enabling organizations to meet regulatory requirements, optimize performance for modern architectures, and future-proof workloads at internet scale. Each NAT Gateway supports up to 16 IPv4 and 16 IPv6 StandardV2 public IP addresses or prefixes. See[IPv6 support for StandardV2 NAT gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-sku#ipv6-support) for more information.\n\n![]()StandardV2 NAT Gateway support for dual stack connectivity now in public preview.\n\n### Flow logs\n\nWith StandardV2, you can now enable flow logs to gain deeper visibility into outbound traffic patterns. Flow logs capture detailed IP-level traffic information, helping you:\n\n- Troubleshoot connectivity issues more efficiently.\n\n- Identify top talkers behind the NAT Gateway (which virtual machines initiate the most connections outbound).\n\n- Analyze traffic for compliance and security auditing for your organization\n\nLearn more at [Enable flow logs on StandardV2 NAT Gateway](https://aka.ms/natflowlogs).\n\n## Deploying StandardV2 NAT Gateway and public IPs\n\nYou can [deploy StandardV2 NAT Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/quickstart-create-nat-gateway-v2) and [StandardV2 public IPs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/create-public-ip-portal?tabs=option-1-create-public-ip-standardv2) using ARM templates, Bicep, PowerShell, or CLI.\n\nPortal and Terraform support is coming soon. For more information on client support, see [StandardV2 NAT Gateway SKU](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-sku#known-limitations).\n\n## Learn More\n\n- [StandardV2 NAT Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/nat-overview#standardv2-nat-gateway)\n- [StandardV2 public IPs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses#sku)\n- [Create and validate StandardV2 NAT Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/nat-gateway/quickstart-create-nat-gateway-v2)\n- [NAT Gateway pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/azure-nat-gateway/)",
