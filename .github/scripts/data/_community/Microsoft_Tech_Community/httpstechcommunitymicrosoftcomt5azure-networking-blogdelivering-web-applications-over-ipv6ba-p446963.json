  "EnhancedContent": "The IPv4 address space pool has been exhausted for some time now, meaning there is no new public address space available for allocation from Internet Registries. The internet continues to run on IPv4 through technical measures such as Network Address Translation (NAT) and [Carrier Grade NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT), and reallocation of address space through [IPv4 address space trading](https://iptrading.com/).\n\n[IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) will ultimately be the dominant network protocol on the internet, as IPv4 life-support mechanisms used by network operators, hosting providers and ISPs will eventually reach the limits of their scalability. Mobile networks are already changing to IPv6-only APNs; reachability of IPv4-only destinations from these mobile network is through 6-4 NAT gateways, which sometimes causes problems.\n\nClient uptake of IPv6 is progressing steadily. [Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption) reports 49% of clients connecting to its services over IPv6 globally, with France leading at 80%.\n\nIPv6 client access measured by Google:\n\nMeanwhile, countries around the world are requiring IPv6 reachability for public web services. Examples are the [United States](http://%28https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/M-21-07.pdf), European Union member states among which [the Netherlands](https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/ipv6) and [Norway](http://%28https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2013-04-05-959#shareModal), and [India](https://dot.gov.in/ipv6-transition-across-stakeholders), and Japan.\n\nIPv6 adoption per country measured by Google:\n\nEntities needing to comply with these mandates are looking at Azure's networking capabilities for solutions. Azure supports IPv6 for both private and public networking, and capabilities have developed and expanded over time.\n\nThis article discusses strategies to build and deploy IPv6-enabled public, internet-facing applications that are reachable from IPv6(-only) clients.\n\n## Azure Networking IPv6 capabilities\n\nAzure's private networking capabilities center on Virtual Networks (VNETs) and the components that are deployed within. Azure VNETs are [IPv4/IPv6 dual stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/ipv6-overview) capable: a VNET **must** always have IPv4 address space allocated, and **can** also have IPv6 address space. Virtual machines in a dual stack VNET will have both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address from the VNET range, and can be behind IPv6 capable External- and Internal Load Balancers. VNETs can be connected through VNET peering, which effectively turns the peered VNETs into a single routing domain. It is now possible to peer only the IPv6 address spaces of VNETs, so that the IPv4 space assigned to VNETs can overlap and communication across the peering is over IPv6. The same is true for connectivity to on-premise over ExpressRoute: the Private Peering can be enabled for IPv6 only, so that VNETs in Azure do not have to have unique IPv4 address space assigned, which may be in short supply in an enterprise.\n\nNot all internal networking components are IPv6 capable yet. Most notable exceptions are VPN Gateway, Azure Firewall and Virtual WAN; IPv6 compatibility is on the roadmap for these services, but target availability dates have not been communicated.\n\nBut now let's focus on Azure's externally facing, public, network services. Azure is ready to let customers publish their web applications over IPv6.\n\nIPv6 capable externally facing network services include:\n\n- [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview#global-delivery-scale-using-microsofts-network)\n\n- [Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ipv6-application-gateway-portal)\n\n- [External Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/deploy-ipv4-ipv6-dual-stack-standard-load-balancer)\n\n- [Public IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses#ip-address-version) and [Public IP address prefixes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-address-prefix)\n\n- [Azure DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-faq#do-azure-dns-name-servers-resolve-over-ipv6--)\n\n- [Azure DDOS Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-sku-comparison#tiers)\n\n- [Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-faqs#does-traffic-manager-support-ipv6-endpoints)\n\n- [App Service](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2024/11/08/Announcing-Inbound-IPv6-support.html) (IPv6 support is in public preview)\n\n## IPv6 Application Delivery\n\n**IPv6 Application Delivery** refers to the architectures and services that enable your web application to be accessible via IPv6. The goal is to provide an IPv6 address and connectivity for clients, while often continuing to run your application on IPv4 internally.\n\nKey benefits of adopting IPv6 in Azure include:\n\n✅ **Expanded Client Reach:** IPv4-only websites risk being unreachable to IPv6-only networks. By enabling IPv6, you expand your reach into growing mobile and IoT markets that use IPv6 by default. Governments and enterprises increasingly mandate IPv6 support for public-facing services.\n\n✅**Address Abundance & No NAT:** IPv6 provides a virtually unlimited address pool, mitigating IPv4 exhaustion concerns. This abundance means each service can have its own public IPv6 address, often removing the need for complex NAT schemes. End-to-end addressing can simplify connectivity and troubleshooting.\n\n✅ **Dual-Stack Compatibility:** Azure supports dual-stack deployments where services listen on both IPv4 and IPv6. This allows a single application instance or endpoint to serve both types of clients seamlessly. Dual-stack ensures you don’t lose any existing IPv4 users while adding IPv6 capability.\n\n✅**Performance and Future Services:** Some networks and clients might experience better performance over IPv6. Also, being IPv6-ready prepares your architecture for future Azure features and services as IPv6 integration deepens across the platform.\n\n**General steps to enable IPv6 connectivity** for a web application in Azure are:\n\n1. **Plan and Enable IPv6 Addressing in Azure**: Define an IPv6 address space in your Azure Virtual Network. Azure allows adding IPv6 address space to existing VNETs, making them dual-stack. A /56 segment for the VNET is recommended, /64 segment for subnets are required (Azure *requires* /64 subnets). If you have existing infrastructure, you might need to create new subnets or migrate resources, especially since older [Application Gateway v1 instances cannot simply be “upgraded” to dual-stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-faq#does-application-gateway-support-ipv6).\n2. **Deploy or Update Frontend Services with IPv6**: Choose a suitable Azure service (Application Gateway, External / Global Load Balancer, etc.) and configure it with a public IPv6 address on the frontend. This usually means selecting \\*Dual Stack\\* configuration so the service gets both an IPv4 and IPv6 public IP. For instance, when creating an Application Gateway v2, you would specify [IP address type: DualStack (IPv4 & IPv6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ipv6-application-gateway-portal)). Azure Front Door [by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) provides dual-stack capabilities with its global endpoints.\n3. **Configure Backends and Routing**: Usually your backend servers or services will remain on IPv4. At the time of writing this in October 2025, Azure Application Gateway does not support IPv6 for backend pool addresses. This is fine because the frontend terminates the IPv6 network connection from the client, and the backend initiates an IPv4 connection to the backend pool or origin. Ensure that your load balancing rules, listener configurations, and health probes are all set up to route traffic to these backends. Both IPv4 and IPv6 frontend listeners can share the same backend pool. Azure Front Door does support IPv6 origins.\n4. **Update DNS Records**: Publish a DNS **AAAA record** for your application’s host name, pointing to the new IPv6 address. This step is critical so that IPv6-only clients can discover the IPv6 address of your service. If your service also has an IPv4 address, you will have both [A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records#record-types) for the same host name. DNS will thus allow clients of either IP family to connect. (In multi-region scenarios using Traffic Manager or Front Door, DNS configuration might be handled through those services as discussed later).\n5. **Test IPv6 Connectivity**: Once set up, test from an IPv6-enabled network or use online tools to ensure the site is reachable via IPv6. Azure’s services like Application Gateway and Front Door will handle the dual-stack routing, but it’s good to verify that content loads on an IPv6-only connection and that SSL certificates, etc., work over IPv6 as they do for IPv4.\n\nNext, we explore specific Azure services and architectures for IPv6 web delivery in detail.\n\n## External Load Balancer - single region\n\nAzure [External Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) (also known as Public Load Balancer) can be deployed in a single region to provide IPv6 access to applications running on virtual machines or VM scale sets. **External Load Balancer acts as a Layer 4 entry point** for IPv6 traffic, distributing connections across backend instances. This scenario is ideal when you have stateless applications or services that do not require Layer 7 features like SSL termination or path-based routing.\n\n**Key IPv6 Features of External Load Balancer**:\n\n- **Dual-Stack Frontend:** Standard Load Balancer supports both [IPv4 and IPv6 frontends](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-ipv6-overview) simultaneously. When configured as dual-stack, the load balancer gets two public IP addresses – one IPv4 and one IPv6 – and can distribute traffic from both IP families to the same backend pool.\n\n- **Zone-Redundant by Default:** Standard Load Balancer is zone-redundant by default, providing high availability across Azure Availability Zones within a region without additional configuration.\n\n- **IPv6 Frontend Availability:** IPv6 support in Standard Load Balancer is available in all Azure regions. Basic Load Balancer does not support IPv6, so you must use Standard SKU.\n\n- **IPv6 Backend Pool Support:** While the frontend accepts IPv6 traffic, the load balancer will not translate IPv6 to IPv4. Backend pool members (VMs) must have private IPv6 addresses. You will need to add private IPv6 addressing to your existing VM IPv4-only infrastructure. This is in contrast to Application Gateway, discussed below, which will terminate inbound IPv6 network sessions and connect to the backend-end over IPv4.\n\n- **Protocol Support:** Supports TCP and UDP load balancing over IPv6, making it suitable for web applications and APIs, but also for non-web TCP- or UDP-based services accessed by IPv6-only clients.\n\nTo set up an IPv6-capable External Load Balancer in one region, follow this high-level process:\n\n1. **Enable IPv6 on the Virtual Network:** Ensure the VNET where your backend VMs reside has an IPv6 address space. Add a dual-stack address space to the VNET (e.g., add an IPv6 space like 2001:db8:1234::/56 to complement your existing IPv4 space). Configure subnets that are dual-stack, containing both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes (/64 for IPv6).\n2. **Create Standard Load Balancer with IPv6 Frontend:** In the Azure Portal, create a new Standard Load Balancer. During creation, configure the frontend IP with both IPv4 and IPv6 public IP addresses. Create or select existing Standard SKU public IP resources – one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.\n3. **Configure Backend Pool:** Add your virtual machines or VM scale set instances to the backend pool. Note that your backend instances will need to have private IPv6 addresses, in addition to IPv4 addresses, to receive inbound IPv6 traffic via the load balancer.\n4. **Set Up Load Balancing Rules:** Create load balancing rules that map frontend ports to backend ports. For web applications, typically map port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) from both the IPv4 and IPv6 frontends to the corresponding backend ports. Configure health probes to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.\n5. **Configure Network Security Groups:** Ensure an NSG is present on the backend VM's subnet, allowing inbound traffic from the internet to the port(s) of the web application. Inbound traffic is \"secure by default\" meaning that inbound connectivity from internet is blocked unless there is an NSG present that explicitly allows it.\n6. **DNS Configuration:** Create DNS records for your application: an A record pointing to the IPv4 address and an AAAA record pointing to the IPv6 address of the load balancer frontend.\n\n**Outcome:** In this single-region scenario, IPv6-only clients will resolve your application's hostname to an IPv6 address and connect to the External Load Balancer over IPv6.\n\n**Example:** Consider a web application running on a VM (or a VM scale set) behind an External Load Balancer in Sweden Central. The VM runs the [Azure Region and Client IP Viewer](https://github.com/mddazure/azure-region-viewer) containerized application exposed on port 80, which displays the region the VM is deployed in and the calling client's IP address. The load balancer's front-end IPv6 address has a DNS name of ipv6webapp-elb-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com. When called from a client with an IPv6 address, the application shows its region and the client's address.\n\n**Limitations & Considerations:**\n\n- *Standard SKU Required:* Basic Load Balancer does not support IPv6. You must use Standard Load Balancer.\n\n- *Layer 4 Only*: Unlike Application Gateway, External Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 (transport layer). It cannot perform SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, or path-based routing. If you need these features, consider Application Gateway instead.\n\n- *Dual stack IPv4/IPv6 Backend required:* Backend pool members must have private IPv6 addresses to receive inbound IPv6 traffic via the load balancer. The load balancer does not translate between the IPv6 frontend and an IPv4 backend.\n\n- *Outbound Connectivity:* If your backend VMs need outbound internet access over IPv6, you need to configure an IPv6 outbound rule.\n\n## Global Load Balancer - multi-region\n\nAzure [Global Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/cross-region-overview) (aka Cross-Region Load Balancer) provides a cloud-native global network load balancing solution for distributing traffic across multiple Azure regions. Unlike DNS-based solutions, Global Load Balancer uses anycast IP addressing to automatically route clients to the nearest healthy regional deployment through Microsoft's global network.\n\n**Key Features of Global Load Balancer:**\n- **Static Anycast Global IP:** Global Load Balancer provides a single static public IP address (both IPv4 and IPv6 supported) that is advertised from all Microsoft WAN edge nodes globally. This anycast address ensures clients always connect to the nearest available Microsoft edge node without requiring DNS resolution.\n- **Geo-Proximity Routing:** The geo-proximity load-balancing algorithm minimizes latency by directing traffic to the nearest region where the backend is deployed. Unlike DNS-based routing, there's no DNS lookup delay - clients connect directly to the anycast IP and are immediately routed to the best region.\n- **Layer 4 Pass-Through:** Global Load Balancer operates as a Layer 4 pass-through network load balancer, preserving the original client IP address (including IPv6 addresses) for backend applications to use in their logic.\n- **Regional Redundancy:** If one region fails, traffic is automatically routed to the next closest healthy regional load balancer within seconds, providing instant global failover without DNS propagation delays.\n\n**Architecture Overview:** Global Load Balancer sits in front of multiple regional Standard Load Balancers, each deployed in different Azure regions. Each regional load balancer serves a local deployment of your application with IPv6 frontends. The global load balancer provides a single anycast IP address that clients worldwide can use to access your application, with automatic routing to the nearest healthy region.\n\n**Multi-Region Deployment Steps:**\n\n1. **Deploy Regional Load Balancers:** Create Standard External Load Balancers in multiple Azure regions (e.g. Sweden Central, East US2). Configure each with dual-stack frontends (IPv4 and IPv6 public IPs) and connect them to regional VM deployments or VM scale sets running your application.\n2. **Configure Global Frontend IP address:** Create a Global tier public IPv6 address for the frontend, in one of the supported [Global Load Balancer home regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/cross-region-overview#home-regions-in-azure). This becomes your application's global anycast address.\n3. **Create Global Load Balancer:** Deploy the Global Load Balancer in the same home region. The home region is where the global load balancer resource is deployed - it doesn't affect traffic routing.\n4. **Add Regional Backends:** Configure the backend pool of the Global Load Balancer to include your regional Standard Load Balancers. Each regional load balancer becomes an endpoint in the global backend pool. The global load balancer automatically monitors the health of each regional endpoint.\n5. **Set Up Load Balancing Rules:** Create load balancing rules mapping frontend ports to backend ports. For web applications, typically map port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). The backend port on the global load balancer must match the frontend port of the regional load balancers.\n6. **Configure Health Probes:** Global Load Balancer automatically monitors the health of regional load balancers every 5 seconds. If a regional load balancer's availability drops to 0, it is automatically removed from rotation, and traffic is redirected to other healthy regions.\n7. **DNS Configuration:** Create DNS records pointing to the global load balancer's anycast IP addresses. Create both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records for your application's hostname pointing to the global load balancer's static IPs.\n\n**Outcome:** IPv6 clients connecting to your application's hostname will resolve to the global load balancer's anycast IPv6 address. When they connect to this address, the Microsoft global network infrastructure automatically routes their connection to the nearest participating Azure region. The regional load balancer then distributes the traffic across local backend instances. If that region becomes unavailable, subsequent connections are automatically routed to the next nearest healthy region.\n\n**Example:** Our web application, which displays the region it is in, and the calling client's IP address, now runs on VMs behind External Load Balancers in Sweden Central and East US2.  The External Load Balancer's front-ends are in the backend pool of a Global Load Balancer, which has a Global tier front-end IPv6 address. The front-end has an FQDN of `ipv6webapp-glb.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com` (the region designation `eastus2` in the FQDN refers to the Global Load Balancer's \"home region\", into which the Global tier public IP must be deployed).\n\nWhen called from a client in Europe, Global Load Balancer directs the request to the instance deployed in Sweden Central.\n\nWhen called from a client in the US, Global Load Balancer directs the request to the instance deployed in US East 2.\n\n**Features:**\n- **Client IP Preservation:** The original IPv6 client address is preserved and available to backend applications, enabling IP-based logic and compliance requirements.\n- **Floating IP Support:** Configure floating IP at the global level for advanced networking scenarios requiring direct server return or high availability clustering.\n- **Instant Scaling:** Add or remove regional deployments behind the global endpoint without service interruption, enabling dynamic scaling for traffic events.\n- **Multiple Protocol Support:** Supports both TCP and UDP traffic distribution across regions, suitable for various application types beyond web services.\n\n**Limitations & Considerations:**\n- *Home Region Requirement:* Global Load Balancer can only be deployed in specific [home regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/cross-region-overview#home-regions-in-azure), though this doesn't affect traffic routing performance.\n- *Public Frontend Only:* Global Load Balancer currently supports only public frontends - internal/private global load balancing is not available.\n- *Standard Load Balancer Backends:* Backend pool can only contain Standard Load Balancers, not Basic Load Balancers or other resource types.\n- S*ame IP Version Requirement:* NAT64 translation isn't supported - frontend and backend must use the same IP version (IPv4 or IPv6).\n- *Port Consistency:* Backend port on global load balancer must match the frontend port of regional load balancers for proper traffic flow.\n- *Health Probe Dependencies:* Regional load balancers must have proper health probes configured for the global load balancer to accurately assess regional health.\n\n**Comparison with DNS-Based Solutions:** Unlike Traffic Manager or other DNS-based global load balancing solutions, Global Load Balancer provides:\n- **Instant Failover:** No DNS TTL delays - failover happens within seconds at the network level.\n- **True Anycast:** Single IP address that works globally without client-side DNS resolution.\n- **Consistent Performance:** Geo-proximity routing through Microsoft's backbone network ensures optimal paths.\n- **Simplified Management:** No DNS record management or TTL considerations.\n\nThis architecture delivers **global high availability and optimal performance** for IPv6 applications through anycast routing, making it a good solution for latency-sensitive applications requiring worldwide accessibility with near-instant regional failover.\n\n## Application Gateway - single region\n\n[Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) can be deployed in a single region to provide IPv6 access to applications in that region. Application Gateway acts as the entry point for IPv6 traffic, terminating HTTP/S from IPv6 clients and forwarding to backend servers over IPv4. This scenario works well when your web application is served from one Azure region and you want to enable IPv6 connectivity for it.\n\n**Key IPv6 Features of Application Gateway (v2 SKU):**\n- **Dual-Stack Frontend:** Application Gateway v2 supports both [IPv4 and IPv6 frontends](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-faq). When configured as dual-stack, the gateway gets two IP addresses – one IPv4 and one IPv6 – and can listen on both. (IPv6-only is not supported; IPv4 is always paired). IPv6 support requires Application Gateway v2, v1 does not support IPv6.\n- **No IPv6 on Backends:** The backend pool must use IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses for backend servers are currently not supported. This means your web servers can remain on IPv4 internal addresses, simplifying adoption because you only enable IPv6 on the frontend.\n- **WAF Support:** The Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) will inspect IPv6 client traffic just as it does IPv4.\n\n**Single Region Deployment Steps:** To set up an IPv6-capable Application Gateway in one region, consider the following high-level process:\n\n1. **Enable IPv6 on the Virtual Network:** Ensure the region’s VNET where the Application Gateway will reside has an IPv6 address space. Configure a subnet for the Application Gateway that is dual-stack (contains both an IPv4 subnet prefix and an IPv6 /64 prefix).\n2. **Deploy Application Gateway (v2) with Dual Stack Frontend:** Create a new Application Gateway using the **Standard\\_v2 or WAF\\_v2 SKU**.\n3. **Populate Backend Pool:** Ensure your backend pool (the target application servers or service) contains (DNS names pointing to) IPv4 addresses of your actual web servers. IPv6 addresses are not supported for backends.\n4. **Configure Listeners and Rules:** Set up listeners on the Application Gateway for your site. When creating an HTTP(S) listener, you choose which frontend IP to use – you would create one listener for IPv4 address and one for IPv6. Both listeners can use the same domain name (hostname) and the same underlying routing rule to your backend pool.\n5. **Testing and DNS:** After the gateway is deployed and configured, note the IPv6 address of the frontend (you can find it in the Gateway’s overview or in the associated Public IP resource). Update your application’s DNS records: create an **AAAA record** pointing to this IPv6 address (and update the A record to point to the IPv4 if it changed). With DNS in place, test the application by accessing it from an IPv6-enabled client or tool.\n\n**Outcome:** In this single-region scenario, IPv6-only clients will resolve your website’s hostname to an IPv6 address and connect to the Application Gateway over IPv6. The Application Gateway then handles the traffic and forwards it to your application over IPv4 internally. From the user perspective, the service now appears natively on IPv6. Importantly, this does not require any changes to the web servers, which can continue using IPv4.\n\nApplication Gateway will include the source IPv6 address in an X-Forwarded-For header, so that the backend application has visibility of the originating client's address.\n\n**Example:** Our web application, which displays the region it is deployed in and the calling client's IP address, now runs on a VM behind Application Gateway in Sweden Central. The front-end has an FQDN of `ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com`.\n\nApplication Gateway terminates the IPv6 connection from the client and proxies the traffic to the application over IPv4. The client's IPv6 address is passed in the X-Forwarded-For header, which is read and displayed by the application.\n\nCalling the application's API endpoint at `/api/region` shows additional detail, including the IPv4 address of the Application Gateway instance that initiates the connection to the backend, and the original client IPv6 address (with the source port number appended) preserved in the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\n``` { \"region\": \"SwedenCentral\", \"clientIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\", \"xForwardedFor\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\", \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.1.0.4\", \"isPrivateIP\": false, \"expressIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\", \"connectionInfo\": {   \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.1.0.4\",   \"remoteFamily\": \"IPv6\",   \"localAddress\": \"::ffff:10.1.1.68\",   \"localPort\": 80 }, \"allHeaders\": {   \"x-forwarded-for\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\" }, \"deploymentAdvice\": \"Public IP detected successfully\"} ```\n\n**Limitations & Considerations:**\n\n- *Application Gateway v1 SKUs are not supported for IPv6.* If you have an older deployment on v1, you’ll need to migrate to v2.\n\n- *IPv6-only Application Gateway is not allowed.* You must have IPv4 alongside IPv6 (the service must be dual-stack). This is usually fine, as dual-stack ensures all clients are covered.\n\n- *No IPv6 backend addresses:* The backend pool must have IPv4 addresses.\n\n- *Management and Monitoring:* Application Gateway logs traffic from IPv6 clients to Log Analytics (the client IP field will show IPv6 addresses).\n\n- *Security:* Azure’s infrastructure provides basic DDoS protection for IPv6 endpoints just as for IPv4. However, it is highly recommended to deploy Azure DDoS Protection Standard: this provides enhanced mitigation tailored to your specific deployment. Consider using the Web Application Firewall function for protection against application layer attacks.\n\n## Application Gateway - multi-region\n\nMission-critical web applications should be deploy in multiple Azure regions, achieving higher availability and lower latency for users worldwide. In a multi-region scenario, you need a mechanism to direct IPv6 client traffic to the “nearest” or healthiest region. Azure Application Gateway by itself is a regional service, so to use it in multiple regions, we use **Azure Traffic Manager** for global DNS load balancing, or use Azure Front Door (covered in the next section) as an alternative. This section focuses on the **Traffic Manager + Application Gateway** approach to multi-region IPv6 delivery.\n\n[Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) is a DNS-based load balancer that can distribute traffic across endpoints in different regions. It works by responding to DNS queries with the appropriate endpoint FQDN or IP, based on the routing method (Performance, Priority, Geographic) configured. Traffic Manager is agnostic to the IP version: it either returns CNAMEs, or AAAA records for IPv6 endpoints and A records for IPv4. This makes it suitable for routing IPv6 traffic globally.\n\n**Architecture Overview:** Each region has its own dual-stack Application Gateway. Traffic Manager is configured with an endpoint entry for each region’s gateway. The application’s FQDN is now a domain name hosted by Traffic Manager such as ipv6webapp.traffimanager.net, or a CNAME that ultimately points to it.\n\nDNS resolution will go through Traffic Manager, which decides which regional gateway’s FQDN to return. The client then connects directly to that Application Gateway’s IPv6 address, as follows:\n\n1.  **DNS query:** Client asks for ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net, which is  hosted in a Traffic Manager profile.\n2. **Traffic Manager decision:** Traffic Manager sees an incoming DNS request and chooses the best endpoint (say, Sweden Central) based on routing rules (e.g., geographic proximity or lowest latency).\n3. **Traffic Manager response:** Traffic Manager returns the FQDN of the Sweden Central Application Gateway to the client.\n4. **DNS Resolution:** The client resolves regional FQDN and receives a AAAA response containing the IPv6 address.\n5. **Client connects:** The client’s browser connects to the West Europe App Gateway IPv6 address directly. The HTTP/S session is established via IPv6 to that regional gateway, which then handles the request.\n6. **Failover:** If that region becomes unavailable, Traffic Manager’s health checks will detect it and subsequent DNS queries will be answered with the FQDN of the secondary region’s gateway.\n\n**Deployment Steps for Multi-Region with Traffic Manager:**\n\n1. **Set up Dual-Stack Application Gateways in each region:** Similar to the single-region case, deploy an Azure Application Gateway v2 in each desired region (e.g., one in North America, one in Europe). Configure the web application in each region, these should be parallel deployments serving the same content.\n2. **Configure a Traffic Manager Profile:** In Azure Traffic Manager, create a profile and choose a [routing method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods) (such as Performance for nearest region routing, or Priority for primary/backup failover). Add [endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-endpoint-types) for each region. Since our endpoints are Azure services with IPs, we can either use *Azure endpoints* (if the Application Gateways have Azure-provided DNS names) or *External endpoints* using the IP addresses. The simplest way is to use the *Public IP resource* of each Application Gateway as an Azure endpoint – ensure each App Gateway’s public IP has a DNS label (so it has a FQDN). Traffic Manager will detect those and also be aware of their IPs. Alternatively, use the IPv6 address as an External endpoint directly. Traffic Manager allows IPv6 addresses and will return AAAA records for them.\n3. **DNS Setup:** Traffic Manager profiles have a FQDN (like ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net). You can either use that as your service’s CNAME, or you can configure your custom domain to CNAME to the Traffic Manager profile.\n4. **Health Probing:** Traffic Manager continuously checks the health of endpoints. When endpoints are Azure App Gateways, it uses HTTP/S probes to a specified URI path, to each gateway’s address. Make sure each App Gateway has a listener on the probing endpoint (e.g., a health check page) and that health probes are enabled.\n5. **Testing Failover and Distribution:** Test the setup by querying DNS from different geographical locations (to see if you get the nearest region’s IP). Also simulate a region down (stop the App Gateway or backend) and observe if Traffic Manager directs traffic to the other region. Because DNS TTLs are involved, failover isn’t instant but typically within a couple of minutes depending on TTL and probe interval.\n\n**Considerations in this Architecture:**\n\n- *Latency vs Failover:* Traffic Manager as a DNS load balancer directs users at connect time, but once a client has an answer (IP address), it keeps sending to that address until the DNS record TTL expires and it re-resolves. This is fine for most web apps. Ensure the TTL in the Traffic Manager profile is not too high (the default is 30 seconds).\n\n- *IPv6 DNS and Connectivity:* Confirm that each region’s IPv6 address is correctly configured and reachable globally. Azure’s public IPv6 addresses are globally routable. Traffic Manager itself is a global service and fully supports IPv6 in its decision-making.\n\n- *Cost:* Using multiple Application Gateways and Traffic Manager incurs costs for each component (App Gateway is per hour + capacity unit, Traffic Manager per million DNS queries). This is a trade-off for high availability.\n\n- *Alternative: Azure Front Door:* Azure Front Door is an alternative to the Traffic Manager + Application Gateway combination. Front Door can automatically handle global routing and failover at layer 7 without DNS-based limitations, offering potentially faster failover. Azure Front Door is discussed in the next section.\n\nIn summary, a multi-region IPv6 web delivery with Application Gateways uses Traffic Manager for global DNS load balancing. Traffic Manager will seamlessly return IPv6 addresses for IPv6 clients, ensuring that no matter where an IPv6-only client is, they get pointed to the nearest available regional deployment of your app. This design achieves global resiliency (withstand a regional outage) and low latency access, leveraging IPv6 connectivity on each regional endpoint.\n\n**Example:** The global FQDN of our application is now ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net and clients will use this FQDN to access the application regardless of their geographical location. Traffic Manager will return the FQDN of one of the regional deployments, `ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com` or `ipv6webappr2-appgw-eastus2.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com` depending on the routing method configured, the health state of the regional endpoints and the client's location. Then the client resolves the regional FQDN through its local DNS server and connects to the regional instance of the application.\n\nDNS resolution from a client in Europe:\n\n``` Resolve-DnsName ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.netName                           Type   TTL   Section    NameHost----                           ----   ---   -------    --------ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net  CNAME  59    Answer     ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.comName       : ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.comQueryType  : AAAATTL        : 10Section    : AnswerIP6Address : 2603:1020:1001:25::168 ```\n\nAnd from a client in the US:\n\nResolve-DnsName ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net Name                           Type   TTL   Section    NameHost ----                           ----   ---   -------    -------- ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net  CNAME  60    Answer     ipv6webappr2-appgw-eastus2.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com Name       : ipv6webappr2-appgw-eastus2.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com QueryType  : AAAA TTL        : 10 Section    : Answer IP6Address : 2603:1030:403:17::5b0\n\n## Azure Front Door\n\n[Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) is an application delivery network with built-in CDN, SSL offload, WAF, and routing capabilities. It provides a single, unified frontend distributed across Microsoft’s edge network. Azure Front Door natively supports IPv6 connectivity.\n\nFor applications that have users worldwide, Front Door offers advantages:\n- **Global Anycast Endpoint:** Provides anycast IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, advertised out of all edge locations, with automatic A and AAAA DNS record support.\n- **IPv4 and IPv6 origin support:** Azure Front Door supports both IPv4 and IPv6 origins (i.e. backends), both within Azure and externally (i.e. accessible over the internet).\n- **Simplified DNS:** Custom domains can be mapped using CNAME records.\n- **Layer-7 Routing:** Supports path-based routing and automatic backend health detection.\n- **Edge Security:** Includes DDoS protection and optional WAF integration.\n\nFront Door enables \"cross-IP version\" scenario's: a client can connect to the Front Door front-end over IPv6, and then Front Door can connect to an IPv4 origin. Conversely, an IPv4-only client can retrieve content from an IPv6 backend via Front Door.\n\nFront Door preserves the client's source IP address in the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\n**Note:** Front Door provides managed IPv6 addresses that are not customer-owned resources. Custom domains should use CNAME records pointing to the Front Door hostname rather than direct IP address references.\n\n**Private Link Integration**\n\nAzure Front Door Premium introduces **Private Link integration**, enabling secure, private connectivity between Front Door and backend resources, without exposing them to the public internet.\n\nWhen Private Link is enabled, Azure Front Door establishes a private endpoint within a Microsoft-managed virtual network. This endpoint acts as a secure bridge between Front Door’s global edge network and your origin resources, such as Azure App Service, Azure Storage, Application Gateway, or workloads behind an internal load balancer.\n\nTraffic from end users still enters through Front Door’s globally distributed POPs, benefiting from features like SSL offload, caching, and WAF protection. However, instead of routing to your origin over public, internet-facing, endpoints, Front Door uses the private Microsoft backbone to reach the private endpoint. This ensures that all traffic between Front Door and your origin remains isolated from external networks.\n\nThe private endpoint connection requires approval from the origin resource owner, adding an extra layer of control. Once approved, the origin can restrict public access entirely, enforcing that all traffic flows through Private Link.\n\nPrivate Link integration brings following **benefits:**\n\n- *Enhanced Security:* By removing public exposure of backend services, Private Link significantly reduces the risk of DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access.\n- *Compliance and Governance:* Many regulatory frameworks mandate private connectivity for sensitive workloads. Private Link helps meet these requirements without sacrificing global availability.\n- *Performance and Reliability:* Traffic between Front Door and your origin travels over Microsoft’s high-speed backbone network, delivering low latency and consistent performance compared to public internet paths.\n- *Defense in Depth:* Combined with Web Application Firewall (WAF), TLS encryption, and DDoS protection, Private Link strengthens your security posture across multiple layers.\n- *Isolation and Control:* Resource owners maintain control over connection approvals, ensuring that only authorized Front Door profiles can access the origin.\n- *Integration with Hybrid Architectures:* For scenarios involving AKS clusters, custom APIs, or workloads behind internal load balancers, Private Link enables secure connectivity without requiring public IPs or complex VPN setups.\n\nPrivate Link transforms Azure Front Door from a global entry point into a fully private delivery mechanism for your applications, aligning with modern security principles and enterprise compliance needs.\n\n**Example:** Our application is now placed behind Azure Front Door. We are combining a public backend endpoint and Private Link integration, to show both in action in a single example. The Sweden Central origin endpoint is the public IPv6 endpoint of the regional External Load Balancers and the origin in US East 2 is connected via Private Link integration\n\nThe global FQDN `ipv6webapp-d4f4euhnb8fge4ce.b01.azurefd.net` and clients will use this FQDN to access the application regardless of their geographical location. The FQDN resolves to Front Door's global anycast address, and the internet will route client requests to the nearest Microsoft edge from this address is advertised. Front Door will then transparently route the request to the nearest origin deployment in Azure. Although public endpoints are used in this example, that traffic will be route over the Microsoft network.\n\nFrom a client in Europe:\n\nCalling the application's api endpoint on `ipv6webapp-d4f4euhnb8fge4ce.b01.azurefd.net/api/region` shows some more detail.\n\n``` { \"region\": \"SwedenCentral\", \"clientIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\", \"xForwardedFor\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\", \"remoteAddress\": \"2a01:111:2053:d801:0:afd:ad4:1b28\", \"isPrivateIP\": false, \"expressIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\", \"connectionInfo\": {   \"remoteAddress\": \"2a01:111:2053:d801:0:afd:ad4:1b28\",   \"remoteFamily\": \"IPv6\",   \"localAddress\": \"2001:db8:1:1::4\",   \"localPort\": 80 }, \"allHeaders\": {   \"x-forwarded-for\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\",   \"x-azure-clientip\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\" }, \"deploymentAdvice\": \"Public IP detected successfully\"} ```\n\n\"remoteAddress\": \"2a01:111:2053:d801:0:afd:ad4:1b28\" is the address from which Front Door sources its request to the origin.\n\nFrom a client in the US:\n\nThe detailed view shows that the IP address calling the backend instance now is local VNET address. Private Link sources traffic coming in from a local address taken from the VNET it is in. The original client IP address is again preserved in the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\n``` {  \"region\": \"eastus2\",  \"clientIp\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\",  \"xForwardedFor\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\",  \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.2.1.5\",  \"isPrivateIP\": false,  \"expressIp\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\",  \"connectionInfo\": {    \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.2.1.5\",    \"remoteFamily\": \"IPv6\",    \"localAddress\": \"::ffff:10.2.2.68\",    \"localPort\": 80  },  \"allHeaders\": {    \"x-forwarded-for\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\"  },  \"deploymentAdvice\": \"Public IP detected successfully\"} ```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIPv6 adoption for web applications is no longer optional. It is essential as public IPv4 address space is depleted, mobile networks increasingly use IPv6 only and governments mandate IPv6 reachability for public services. Azure's comprehensive dual-stack networking capabilities provide a clear path forward, enabling organizations to leverage IPv6 externally without sacrificing IPv4 compatibility or requiring complete infrastructure overhauls.\n\nAzure's externally facing services — including Application Gateway, External Load Balancer, Global Load Balancer, and Front Door — support IPv6 frontends, while Application Gateway and Front Door maintain IPv4 backend connectivity. This architecture allows applications to remain unchanged while instantly becoming accessible to IPv6-only clients.\n\nFor single-region deployments, Application Gateway offers layer-7 features like SSL termination and WAF protection. External Load Balancer provides high-performance layer-4 distribution. Multi-region scenarios benefit from Traffic Manager's DNS-based routing combined with regional Application Gateways, or the superior performance and failover capabilities of Global Load Balancer's anycast addressing.\n\nAzure Front Door provides global IPv6 delivery with edge optimization, built-in security, and seamless failover across Microsoft's network. Private Link integration allows secure global IPv6 distribution while maintaining backend isolation.\n\nThe transition to IPv6 application delivery on Azure is straightforward: enable dual-stack addressing on virtual networks, configure IPv6 frontends on load balancing services, and update DNS records. With Application Gateway or Front Door, backend applications require no modifications. These Azure services handle the IPv4-to-IPv6 translation seamlessly. This approach ensures both immediate IPv6 accessibility and long-term architectural flexibility as IPv6 adoption accelerates globally.\n\nUpdated Nov 14, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[application gateway](/tag/application%20gateway?nodeId=board%3AAzureNetworkingBlog)\n\n[azure front door](/tag/azure%20front%20door?nodeId=board%3AAzureNetworkingBlog)\n\n[azure networking](/tag/azure%20networking?nodeId=board%3AAzureNetworkingBlog)\n\n[content delivery network](/tag/content%20delivery%20network?nodeId=board%3AAzureNetworkingBlog)\n\n[load balancer](/tag/load%20balancer?nodeId=board%3AAzureNetworkingBlog)\n\n[traffic manager](/tag/traffic%20manager?nodeId=board%3AAzureNetworkingBlog)\n\n[!\\[Marc de Droog&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/marc%20de%20droog/198661) [Marc de Droog](/users/marc%20de%20droog/198661) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined September 20, 2018\n\n[View Profile](/users/marc%20de%20droog/198661)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurenetworkingblog [Azure Networking Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurenetworkingblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",

  "Description": "The IPv4 address space pool has been exhausted for some time now, meaning there is no new public address space available for allocation from Internet Registries. The internet continues to run on IPv4 through technical measures such as Network Address Translation (NAT) and [Carrier Grade NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT), and reallocation of address space through [IPv4 address space trading](https://iptrading.com/).\n\n[IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) will ultimately be the dominant network protocol on the internet, as IPv4 life-support mechanisms used by network operators, hosting providers and ISPs will eventually reach the limits of their scalability. Mobile networks are already changing to IPv6-only APNs; reachability of IPv4-only destinations from these mobile network is through 6-4 NAT gateways, which sometimes causes problems.\n\nClient uptake of IPv6 is progressing steadily. [Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption) reports 49% of clients connecting to its services over IPv6 globally, with France leading at 80%.\n\nIPv6 client access measured by Google:\n\n![]()\n\nMeanwhile, countries around the world are requiring IPv6 reachability for public web services. Examples are the [United States](http://%28https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/M-21-07.pdf), European Union member states among which [the Netherlands](https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/ipv6) and [Norway](http://%28https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2013-04-05-959#shareModal), and [India](https://dot.gov.in/ipv6-transition-across-stakeholders), and Japan.\n\nIPv6 adoption per country measured by Google:\n\n![]()\n\nEntities needing to comply with these mandates are looking at Azure's networking capabilities for solutions. Azure supports IPv6 for both private and public networking, and capabilities have developed and expanded over time.\n\nThis article discusses strategies to build and deploy IPv6-enabled public, internet-facing applications that are reachable from IPv6(-only) clients.\n\n## Azure Networking IPv6 capabilities\n\nAzure's private networking capabilities center on Virtual Networks (VNETs) and the components that are deployed within. Azure VNETs are [IPv4/IPv6 dual stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/ipv6-overview) capable: a VNET **must** always have IPv4 address space allocated, and **can** also have IPv6 address space. Virtual machines in a dual stack VNET will have both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address from the VNET range, and can be behind IPv6 capable External- and Internal Load Balancers. VNETs can be connected through VNET peering, which effectively turns the peered VNETs into a single routing domain. It is now possible to peer only the IPv6 address spaces of VNETs, so that the IPv4 space assigned to VNETs can overlap and communication across the peering is over IPv6. The same is true for connectivity to on-premise over ExpressRoute: the Private Peering can be enabled for IPv6 only, so that VNETs in Azure do not have to have unique IPv4 address space assigned, which may be in short supply in an enterprise.\n\n![]()\n\nNot all internal networking components are IPv6 capable yet. Most notable exceptions are VPN Gateway, Azure Firewall and Virtual WAN; IPv6 compatibility is on the roadmap for these services, but target availability dates have not been communicated.\n\nBut now let's focus on Azure's externally facing, public, network services. Azure is ready to let customers publish their web applications over IPv6.\n\nIPv6 capable externally facing network services include:\n\n- [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview#global-delivery-scale-using-microsofts-network)\n\n- [Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ipv6-application-gateway-portal)\n\n- [External Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/deploy-ipv4-ipv6-dual-stack-standard-load-balancer)\n\n- [Public IP addresses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-addresses#ip-address-version) and [Public IP address prefixes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/public-ip-address-prefix)\n\n- [Azure DNS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-faq#do-azure-dns-name-servers-resolve-over-ipv6--)\n\n- [Azure DDOS Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-sku-comparison#tiers)\n\n- [Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-faqs#does-traffic-manager-support-ipv6-endpoints)\n\n- [App Service](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2024/11/08/Announcing-Inbound-IPv6-support.html) (IPv6 support is in public preview)\n\n## IPv6 Application Delivery\n\n**IPv6 Application Delivery** refers to the architectures and services that enable your web application to be accessible via IPv6. The goal is to provide an IPv6 address and connectivity for clients, while often continuing to run your application on IPv4 internally.\n\nKey benefits of adopting IPv6 in Azure include:\n\n✅ **Expanded Client Reach:** IPv4-only websites risk being unreachable to IPv6-only networks. By enabling IPv6, you expand your reach into growing mobile and IoT markets that use IPv6 by default. Governments and enterprises increasingly mandate IPv6 support for public-facing services.\n\n✅**Address Abundance & No NAT:** IPv6 provides a virtually unlimited address pool, mitigating IPv4 exhaustion concerns. This abundance means each service can have its own public IPv6 address, often removing the need for complex NAT schemes. End-to-end addressing can simplify connectivity and troubleshooting.\n\n✅ **Dual-Stack Compatibility:** Azure supports dual-stack deployments where services listen on both IPv4 and IPv6. This allows a single application instance or endpoint to serve both types of clients seamlessly. Dual-stack ensures you don’t lose any existing IPv4 users while adding IPv6 capability.\n\n✅**Performance and Future Services:** Some networks and clients might experience better performance over IPv6. Also, being IPv6-ready prepares your architecture for future Azure features and services as IPv6 integration deepens across the platform.\n\n**General steps to enable IPv6 connectivity** for a web application in Azure are:\n\n1. **Plan and Enable IPv6 Addressing in Azure**: Define an IPv6 address space in your Azure Virtual Network. Azure allows adding IPv6 address space to existing VNETs, making them dual-stack. A /56 segment for the VNET is recommended, /64 segment for subnets are required (Azure *requires* /64 subnets). If you have existing infrastructure, you might need to create new subnets or migrate resources, especially since older [Application Gateway v1 instances cannot simply be “upgraded” to dual-stack](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-faq#does-application-gateway-support-ipv6).\n2. **Deploy or Update Frontend Services with IPv6**: Choose a suitable Azure service (Application Gateway, External / Global Load Balancer, etc.) and configure it with a public IPv6 address on the frontend. This usually means selecting \\*Dual Stack\\* configuration so the service gets both an IPv4 and IPv6 public IP. For instance, when creating an Application Gateway v2, you would specify [IP address type: DualStack (IPv4 & IPv6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/ipv6-application-gateway-portal)). Azure Front Door [by default](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) provides dual-stack capabilities with its global endpoints.\n3. **Configure Backends and Routing**: Usually your backend servers or services will remain on IPv4. At the time of writing this in October 2025, Azure Application Gateway does not support IPv6 for backend pool addresses. This is fine because the frontend terminates the IPv6 network connection from the client, and the backend initiates an IPv4 connection to the backend pool or origin. Ensure that your load balancing rules, listener configurations, and health probes are all set up to route traffic to these backends. Both IPv4 and IPv6 frontend listeners can share the same backend pool. Azure Front Door does support IPv6 origins.\n4. **Update DNS Records**: Publish a DNS **AAAA record** for your application’s host name, pointing to the new IPv6 address. This step is critical so that IPv6-only clients can discover the IPv6 address of your service. If your service also has an IPv4 address, you will have both [A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records#record-types) for the same host name. DNS will thus allow clients of either IP family to connect. (In multi-region scenarios using Traffic Manager or Front Door, DNS configuration might be handled through those services as discussed later).\n5. **Test IPv6 Connectivity**: Once set up, test from an IPv6-enabled network or use online tools to ensure the site is reachable via IPv6. Azure’s services like Application Gateway and Front Door will handle the dual-stack routing, but it’s good to verify that content loads on an IPv6-only connection and that SSL certificates, etc., work over IPv6 as they do for IPv4.\n\nNext, we explore specific Azure services and architectures for IPv6 web delivery in detail.\n\n## External Load Balancer - single region\n\nAzure [External Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) (also known as Public Load Balancer) can be deployed in a single region to provide IPv6 access to applications running on virtual machines or VM scale sets. **External Load Balancer acts as a Layer 4 entry point** for IPv6 traffic, distributing connections across backend instances. This scenario is ideal when you have stateless applications or services that do not require Layer 7 features like SSL termination or path-based routing.\n\n**Key IPv6 Features of External Load Balancer**:\n\n- **Dual-Stack Frontend:** Standard Load Balancer supports both [IPv4 and IPv6 frontends](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-ipv6-overview) simultaneously. When configured as dual-stack, the load balancer gets two public IP addresses – one IPv4 and one IPv6 – and can distribute traffic from both IP families to the same backend pool.\n\n- **Zone-Redundant by Default:** Standard Load Balancer is zone-redundant by default, providing high availability across Azure Availability Zones within a region without additional configuration.\n\n- **IPv6 Frontend Availability:** IPv6 support in Standard Load Balancer is available in all Azure regions. Basic Load Balancer does not support IPv6, so you must use Standard SKU.\n\n- **IPv6 Backend Pool Support:** While the frontend accepts IPv6 traffic, the load balancer will not translate IPv6 to IPv4. Backend pool members (VMs) must have private IPv6 addresses. You will need to add private IPv6 addressing to your existing VM IPv4-only infrastructure. This is in contrast to Application Gateway, discussed below, which will terminate inbound IPv6 network sessions and connect to the backend-end over IPv4.\n\n- **Protocol Support:** Supports TCP and UDP load balancing over IPv6, making it suitable for web applications and APIs, but also for non-web TCP- or UDP-based services accessed by IPv6-only clients.\n\n![]()\n\nTo set up an IPv6-capable External Load Balancer in one region, follow this high-level process:\n\n1. **Enable IPv6 on the Virtual Network:** Ensure the VNET where your backend VMs reside has an IPv6 address space. Add a dual-stack address space to the VNET (e.g., add an IPv6 space like 2001:db8:1234::/56 to complement your existing IPv4 space). Configure subnets that are dual-stack, containing both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes (/64 for IPv6).\n2. **Create Standard Load Balancer with IPv6 Frontend:** In the Azure Portal, create a new Standard Load Balancer. During creation, configure the frontend IP with both IPv4 and IPv6 public IP addresses. Create or select existing Standard SKU public IP resources – one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.\n3. **Configure Backend Pool:** Add your virtual machines or VM scale set instances to the backend pool. Note that your backend instances will need to have private IPv6 addresses, in addition to IPv4 addresses, to receive inbound IPv6 traffic via the load balancer.\n4. **Set Up Load Balancing Rules:** Create load balancing rules that map frontend ports to backend ports. For web applications, typically map port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) from both the IPv4 and IPv6 frontends to the corresponding backend ports. Configure health probes to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.\n5. **Configure Network Security Groups:** Ensure an NSG is present on the backend VM's subnet, allowing inbound traffic from the internet to the port(s) of the web application. Inbound traffic is \"secure by default\" meaning that inbound connectivity from internet is blocked unless there is an NSG present that explicitly allows it.\n6. **DNS Configuration:** Create DNS records for your application: an A record pointing to the IPv4 address and an AAAA record pointing to the IPv6 address of the load balancer frontend.\n\n**Outcome:** In this single-region scenario, IPv6-only clients will resolve your application's hostname to an IPv6 address and connect to the External Load Balancer over IPv6.\n\n**Example:** Consider a web application running on a VM (or a VM scale set) behind an External Load Balancer in Sweden Central. The VM runs the [Azure Region and Client IP Viewer](https://github.com/mddazure/azure-region-viewer) containerized application exposed on port 80, which displays the region the VM is deployed in and the calling client's IP address. The load balancer's front-end IPv6 address has a DNS name of ipv6webapp-elb-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com. When called from a client with an IPv6 address, the application shows its region and the client's address.\n\n![]()\n\n**Limitations & Considerations:**\n\n- *Standard SKU Required:* Basic Load Balancer does not support IPv6. You must use Standard Load Balancer.\n\n- *Layer 4 Only*: Unlike Application Gateway, External Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 (transport layer). It cannot perform SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, or path-based routing. If you need these features, consider Application Gateway instead.\n\n- *Dual stack IPv4/IPv6 Backend required:* Backend pool members must have private IPv6 addresses to receive inbound IPv6 traffic via the load balancer. The load balancer does not translate between the IPv6 frontend and an IPv4 backend.\n\n- *Outbound Connectivity:* If your backend VMs need outbound internet access over IPv6, you need to configure an IPv6 outbound rule.\n\n## Global Load Balancer - multi-region\n\nAzure [Global Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/cross-region-overview) (aka Cross-Region Load Balancer) provides a cloud-native global network load balancing solution for distributing traffic across multiple Azure regions. Unlike DNS-based solutions, Global Load Balancer uses anycast IP addressing to automatically route clients to the nearest healthy regional deployment through Microsoft's global network.\n\n**Key Features of Global Load Balancer:**\n- **Static Anycast Global IP:** Global Load Balancer provides a single static public IP address (both IPv4 and IPv6 supported) that is advertised from all Microsoft WAN edge nodes globally. This anycast address ensures clients always connect to the nearest available Microsoft edge node without requiring DNS resolution.\n- **Geo-Proximity Routing:** The geo-proximity load-balancing algorithm minimizes latency by directing traffic to the nearest region where the backend is deployed. Unlike DNS-based routing, there's no DNS lookup delay - clients connect directly to the anycast IP and are immediately routed to the best region.\n- **Layer 4 Pass-Through:** Global Load Balancer operates as a Layer 4 pass-through network load balancer, preserving the original client IP address (including IPv6 addresses) for backend applications to use in their logic.\n- **Regional Redundancy:** If one region fails, traffic is automatically routed to the next closest healthy regional load balancer within seconds, providing instant global failover without DNS propagation delays.\n\n**Architecture Overview:** Global Load Balancer sits in front of multiple regional Standard Load Balancers, each deployed in different Azure regions. Each regional load balancer serves a local deployment of your application with IPv6 frontends. The global load balancer provides a single anycast IP address that clients worldwide can use to access your application, with automatic routing to the nearest healthy region.\n\n![]()\n\n**Multi-Region Deployment Steps:**\n\n1. **Deploy Regional Load Balancers:** Create Standard External Load Balancers in multiple Azure regions (e.g. Sweden Central, East US2). Configure each with dual-stack frontends (IPv4 and IPv6 public IPs) and connect them to regional VM deployments or VM scale sets running your application.\n2. **Configure Global Frontend IP address:** Create a Global tier public IPv6 address for the frontend, in one of the supported [Global Load Balancer home regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/cross-region-overview#home-regions-in-azure). This becomes your application's global anycast address.\n3. **Create Global Load Balancer:** Deploy the Global Load Balancer in the same home region. The home region is where the global load balancer resource is deployed - it doesn't affect traffic routing.\n4. **Add Regional Backends:** Configure the backend pool of the Global Load Balancer to include your regional Standard Load Balancers. Each regional load balancer becomes an endpoint in the global backend pool. The global load balancer automatically monitors the health of each regional endpoint.\n5. **Set Up Load Balancing Rules:** Create load balancing rules mapping frontend ports to backend ports. For web applications, typically map port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). The backend port on the global load balancer must match the frontend port of the regional load balancers.\n6. **Configure Health Probes:** Global Load Balancer automatically monitors the health of regional load balancers every 5 seconds. If a regional load balancer's availability drops to 0, it is automatically removed from rotation, and traffic is redirected to other healthy regions.\n7. **DNS Configuration:** Create DNS records pointing to the global load balancer's anycast IP addresses. Create both A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records for your application's hostname pointing to the global load balancer's static IPs.\n\n**Outcome:** IPv6 clients connecting to your application's hostname will resolve to the global load balancer's anycast IPv6 address. When they connect to this address, the Microsoft global network infrastructure automatically routes their connection to the nearest participating Azure region. The regional load balancer then distributes the traffic across local backend instances. If that region becomes unavailable, subsequent connections are automatically routed to the next nearest healthy region.\n\n**Example:** Our web application, which displays the region it is in, and the calling client's IP address, now runs on VMs behind External Load Balancers in Sweden Central and East US2. The External Load Balancer's front-ends are in the backend pool of a Global Load Balancer, which has a Global tier front-end IPv6 address. The front-end has an FQDN of `ipv6webapp-glb.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com` (the region designation `eastus2` in the FQDN refers to the Global Load Balancer's \"home region\", into which the Global tier public IP must be deployed).\n\nWhen called from a client in Europe, Global Load Balancer directs the request to the instance deployed in Sweden Central.\n\n![]()\n\nWhen called from a client in the US, Global Load Balancer directs the request to the instance deployed in US East 2.\n\n![]()\n\n**Features:**\n- **Client IP Preservation:** The original IPv6 client address is preserved and available to backend applications, enabling IP-based logic and compliance requirements.\n- **Floating IP Support:** Configure floating IP at the global level for advanced networking scenarios requiring direct server return or high availability clustering.\n- **Instant Scaling:** Add or remove regional deployments behind the global endpoint without service interruption, enabling dynamic scaling for traffic events.\n- **Multiple Protocol Support:** Supports both TCP and UDP traffic distribution across regions, suitable for various application types beyond web services.\n\n**Limitations & Considerations:**\n- *Home Region Requirement:* Global Load Balancer can only be deployed in specific [home regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/cross-region-overview#home-regions-in-azure), though this doesn't affect traffic routing performance.\n- *Public Frontend Only:* Global Load Balancer currently supports only public frontends - internal/private global load balancing is not available.\n- *Standard Load Balancer Backends:* Backend pool can only contain Standard Load Balancers, not Basic Load Balancers or other resource types.\n- S*ame IP Version Requirement:* NAT64 translation isn't supported - frontend and backend must use the same IP version (IPv4 or IPv6).\n- *Port Consistency:* Backend port on global load balancer must match the frontend port of regional load balancers for proper traffic flow.\n- *Health Probe Dependencies:* Regional load balancers must have proper health probes configured for the global load balancer to accurately assess regional health.\n\n**Comparison with DNS-Based Solutions:** Unlike Traffic Manager or other DNS-based global load balancing solutions, Global Load Balancer provides:\n- **Instant Failover:** No DNS TTL delays - failover happens within seconds at the network level.\n- **True Anycast:** Single IP address that works globally without client-side DNS resolution.\n- **Consistent Performance:** Geo-proximity routing through Microsoft's backbone network ensures optimal paths.\n- **Simplified Management:** No DNS record management or TTL considerations.\n\nThis architecture delivers **global high availability and optimal performance** for IPv6 applications through anycast routing, making it a good solution for latency-sensitive applications requiring worldwide accessibility with near-instant regional failover.\n\n## Application Gateway - single region\n\n[Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) can be deployed in a single region to provide IPv6 access to applications in that region. Application Gateway acts as the entry point for IPv6 traffic, terminating HTTP/S from IPv6 clients and forwarding to backend servers over IPv4. This scenario works well when your web application is served from one Azure region and you want to enable IPv6 connectivity for it.\n\n**Key IPv6 Features of Application Gateway (v2 SKU):**\n- **Dual-Stack Frontend:** Application Gateway v2 supports both [IPv4 and IPv6 frontends](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-faq). When configured as dual-stack, the gateway gets two IP addresses – one IPv4 and one IPv6 – and can listen on both. (IPv6-only is not supported; IPv4 is always paired). IPv6 support requires Application Gateway v2, v1 does not support IPv6.\n- **No IPv6 on Backends:** The backend pool must use IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses for backend servers are currently not supported. This means your web servers can remain on IPv4 internal addresses, simplifying adoption because you only enable IPv6 on the frontend.\n- **WAF Support:** The Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) will inspect IPv6 client traffic just as it does IPv4.\n\n![]()\n\n**Single Region Deployment Steps:** To set up an IPv6-capable Application Gateway in one region, consider the following high-level process:\n\n1. **Enable IPv6 on the Virtual Network:** Ensure the region’s VNET where the Application Gateway will reside has an IPv6 address space. Configure a subnet for the Application Gateway that is dual-stack (contains both an IPv4 subnet prefix and an IPv6 /64 prefix).\n2. **Deploy Application Gateway (v2) with Dual Stack Frontend:** Create a new Application Gateway using the **Standard\\_v2 or WAF\\_v2 SKU**.\n3. **Populate Backend Pool:** Ensure your backend pool (the target application servers or service) contains (DNS names pointing to) IPv4 addresses of your actual web servers. IPv6 addresses are not supported for backends.\n4. **Configure Listeners and Rules:** Set up listeners on the Application Gateway for your site. When creating an HTTP(S) listener, you choose which frontend IP to use – you would create one listener for IPv4 address and one for IPv6. Both listeners can use the same domain name (hostname) and the same underlying routing rule to your backend pool.\n5. **Testing and DNS:** After the gateway is deployed and configured, note the IPv6 address of the frontend (you can find it in the Gateway’s overview or in the associated Public IP resource). Update your application’s DNS records: create an **AAAA record** pointing to this IPv6 address (and update the A record to point to the IPv4 if it changed). With DNS in place, test the application by accessing it from an IPv6-enabled client or tool.\n\n**Outcome:** In this single-region scenario, IPv6-only clients will resolve your website’s hostname to an IPv6 address and connect to the Application Gateway over IPv6. The Application Gateway then handles the traffic and forwards it to your application over IPv4 internally. From the user perspective, the service now appears natively on IPv6. Importantly, this does not require any changes to the web servers, which can continue using IPv4.\n\nApplication Gateway will include the source IPv6 address in an X-Forwarded-For header, so that the backend application has visibility of the originating client's address.\n\n**Example:** Our web application, which displays the region it is deployed in and the calling client's IP address, now runs on a VM behind Application Gateway in Sweden Central. The front-end has an FQDN of `ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com`.\n\nApplication Gateway terminates the IPv6 connection from the client and proxies the traffic to the application over IPv4. The client's IPv6 address is passed in the X-Forwarded-For header, which is read and displayed by the application.\n\n![]()\n\nCalling the application's API endpoint at `/api/region` shows additional detail, including the IPv4 address of the Application Gateway instance that initiates the connection to the backend, and the original client IPv6 address (with the source port number appended) preserved in the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\n``` { \"region\": \"SwedenCentral\", \"clientIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\", \"xForwardedFor\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\", \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.1.0.4\", \"isPrivateIP\": false, \"expressIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\", \"connectionInfo\": { \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.1.0.4\", \"remoteFamily\": \"IPv6\", \"localAddress\": \"::ffff:10.1.1.68\", \"localPort\": 80 }, \"allHeaders\": { \"x-forwarded-for\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21:60769\" }, \"deploymentAdvice\": \"Public IP detected successfully\"} ```\n\n**Limitations & Considerations:**\n\n- *Application Gateway v1 SKUs are not supported for IPv6.* If you have an older deployment on v1, you’ll need to migrate to v2.\n\n- *IPv6-only Application Gateway is not allowed.* You must have IPv4 alongside IPv6 (the service must be dual-stack). This is usually fine, as dual-stack ensures all clients are covered.\n\n- *No IPv6 backend addresses:* The backend pool must have IPv4 addresses.\n\n- *Management and Monitoring:* Application Gateway logs traffic from IPv6 clients to Log Analytics (the client IP field will show IPv6 addresses).\n\n- *Security:* Azure’s infrastructure provides basic DDoS protection for IPv6 endpoints just as for IPv4. However, it is highly recommended to deploy Azure DDoS Protection Standard: this provides enhanced mitigation tailored to your specific deployment. Consider using the Web Application Firewall function for protection against application layer attacks.\n\n## Application Gateway - multi-region\n\nMission-critical web applications should be deploy in multiple Azure regions, achieving higher availability and lower latency for users worldwide. In a multi-region scenario, you need a mechanism to direct IPv6 client traffic to the “nearest” or healthiest region. Azure Application Gateway by itself is a regional service, so to use it in multiple regions, we use **Azure Traffic Manager** for global DNS load balancing, or use Azure Front Door (covered in the next section) as an alternative. This section focuses on the **Traffic Manager + Application Gateway** approach to multi-region IPv6 delivery.\n\n[Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) is a DNS-based load balancer that can distribute traffic across endpoints in different regions. It works by responding to DNS queries with the appropriate endpoint FQDN or IP, based on the routing method (Performance, Priority, Geographic) configured. Traffic Manager is agnostic to the IP version: it either returns CNAMEs, or AAAA records for IPv6 endpoints and A records for IPv4. This makes it suitable for routing IPv6 traffic globally.\n\n**Architecture Overview:** Each region has its own dual-stack Application Gateway. Traffic Manager is configured with an endpoint entry for each region’s gateway. The application’s FQDN is now a domain name hosted by Traffic Manager such as ipv6webapp.traffimanager.net, or a CNAME that ultimately points to it.\n\n![]()\n\nDNS resolution will go through Traffic Manager, which decides which regional gateway’s FQDN to return. The client then connects directly to that Application Gateway’s IPv6 address, as follows:\n\n1. **DNS query:** Client asks for ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net, which is hosted in a Traffic Manager profile.\n2. **Traffic Manager decision:** Traffic Manager sees an incoming DNS request and chooses the best endpoint (say, Sweden Central) based on routing rules (e.g., geographic proximity or lowest latency).\n3. **Traffic Manager response:** Traffic Manager returns the FQDN of the Sweden Central Application Gateway to the client.\n4. **DNS Resolution:** The client resolves regional FQDN and receives a AAAA response containing the IPv6 address.\n5. **Client connects:** The client’s browser connects to the West Europe App Gateway IPv6 address directly. The HTTP/S session is established via IPv6 to that regional gateway, which then handles the request.\n6. **Failover:** If that region becomes unavailable, Traffic Manager’s health checks will detect it and subsequent DNS queries will be answered with the FQDN of the secondary region’s gateway.\n\n**Deployment Steps for Multi-Region with Traffic Manager:**\n\n1. **Set up Dual-Stack Application Gateways in each region:** Similar to the single-region case, deploy an Azure Application Gateway v2 in each desired region (e.g., one in North America, one in Europe). Configure the web application in each region, these should be parallel deployments serving the same content.\n2. **Configure a Traffic Manager Profile:** In Azure Traffic Manager, create a profile and choose a [routing method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-routing-methods) (such as Performance for nearest region routing, or Priority for primary/backup failover). Add [endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-endpoint-types) for each region. Since our endpoints are Azure services with IPs, we can either use *Azure endpoints* (if the Application Gateways have Azure-provided DNS names) or *External endpoints* using the IP addresses. The simplest way is to use the *Public IP resource* of each Application Gateway as an Azure endpoint – ensure each App Gateway’s public IP has a DNS label (so it has a FQDN). Traffic Manager will detect those and also be aware of their IPs. Alternatively, use the IPv6 address as an External endpoint directly. Traffic Manager allows IPv6 addresses and will return AAAA records for them.\n3. **DNS Setup:** Traffic Manager profiles have a FQDN (like ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net). You can either use that as your service’s CNAME, or you can configure your custom domain to CNAME to the Traffic Manager profile.\n4. **Health Probing:** Traffic Manager continuously checks the health of endpoints. When endpoints are Azure App Gateways, it uses HTTP/S probes to a specified URI path, to each gateway’s address. Make sure each App Gateway has a listener on the probing endpoint (e.g., a health check page) and that health probes are enabled.\n5. **Testing Failover and Distribution:** Test the setup by querying DNS from different geographical locations (to see if you get the nearest region’s IP). Also simulate a region down (stop the App Gateway or backend) and observe if Traffic Manager directs traffic to the other region. Because DNS TTLs are involved, failover isn’t instant but typically within a couple of minutes depending on TTL and probe interval.\n\n**Considerations in this Architecture:**\n\n- *Latency vs Failover:* Traffic Manager as a DNS load balancer directs users at connect time, but once a client has an answer (IP address), it keeps sending to that address until the DNS record TTL expires and it re-resolves. This is fine for most web apps. Ensure the TTL in the Traffic Manager profile is not too high (the default is 30 seconds).\n\n- *IPv6 DNS and Connectivity:* Confirm that each region’s IPv6 address is correctly configured and reachable globally. Azure’s public IPv6 addresses are globally routable. Traffic Manager itself is a global service and fully supports IPv6 in its decision-making.\n\n- *Cost:* Using multiple Application Gateways and Traffic Manager incurs costs for each component (App Gateway is per hour + capacity unit, Traffic Manager per million DNS queries). This is a trade-off for high availability.\n\n- *Alternative: Azure Front Door:* Azure Front Door is an alternative to the Traffic Manager + Application Gateway combination. Front Door can automatically handle global routing and failover at layer 7 without DNS-based limitations, offering potentially faster failover. Azure Front Door is discussed in the next section.\n\nIn summary, a multi-region IPv6 web delivery with Application Gateways uses Traffic Manager for global DNS load balancing. Traffic Manager will seamlessly return IPv6 addresses for IPv6 clients, ensuring that no matter where an IPv6-only client is, they get pointed to the nearest available regional deployment of your app. This design achieves global resiliency (withstand a regional outage) and low latency access, leveraging IPv6 connectivity on each regional endpoint.\n\n**Example:** The global FQDN of our application is now ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net and clients will use this FQDN to access the application regardless of their geographical location. Traffic Manager will return the FQDN of one of the regional deployments, `ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.com` or `ipv6webappr2-appgw-eastus2.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com` depending on the routing method configured, the health state of the regional endpoints and the client's location. Then the client resolves the regional FQDN through its local DNS server and connects to the regional instance of the application.\n\nDNS resolution from a client in Europe:\n\n``` Resolve-DnsName ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.netName Type TTL Section NameHost---- ---- --- ------- --------ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net CNAME 59 Answer ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.comName : ipv6webapp-appgw-swedencentral.swedencentral.cloudapp.azure.comQueryType : AAAATTL : 10Section : AnswerIP6Address : 2603:1020:1001:25::168 ```\n\nAnd from a client in the US:\n\nResolve-DnsName ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net Name Type TTL Section NameHost ---- ---- --- ------- -------- ipv6webapp.trafficmanager.net CNAME 60 Answer ipv6webappr2-appgw-eastus2.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com Name : ipv6webappr2-appgw-eastus2.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com QueryType : AAAA TTL : 10 Section : Answer IP6Address : 2603:1030:403:17::5b0\n\n## Azure Front Door\n\n[Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview) is an application delivery network with built-in CDN, SSL offload, WAF, and routing capabilities. It provides a single, unified frontend distributed across Microsoft’s edge network. Azure Front Door natively supports IPv6 connectivity.\n\nFor applications that have users worldwide, Front Door offers advantages:\n- **Global Anycast Endpoint:** Provides anycast IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, advertised out of all edge locations, with automatic A and AAAA DNS record support.\n- **IPv4 and IPv6 origin support:** Azure Front Door supports both IPv4 and IPv6 origins (i.e. backends), both within Azure and externally (i.e. accessible over the internet).\n- **Simplified DNS:** Custom domains can be mapped using CNAME records.\n- **Layer-7 Routing:** Supports path-based routing and automatic backend health detection.\n- **Edge Security:** Includes DDoS protection and optional WAF integration.\n\nFront Door enables \"cross-IP version\" scenario's: a client can connect to the Front Door front-end over IPv6, and then Front Door can connect to an IPv4 origin. Conversely, an IPv4-only client can retrieve content from an IPv6 backend via Front Door.\n\nFront Door preserves the client's source IP address in the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\n**Note:** Front Door provides managed IPv6 addresses that are not customer-owned resources. Custom domains should use CNAME records pointing to the Front Door hostname rather than direct IP address references.\n\n**Private Link Integration**\n\nAzure Front Door Premium introduces **Private Link integration**, enabling secure, private connectivity between Front Door and backend resources, without exposing them to the public internet.\n\nWhen Private Link is enabled, Azure Front Door establishes a private endpoint within a Microsoft-managed virtual network. This endpoint acts as a secure bridge between Front Door’s global edge network and your origin resources, such as Azure App Service, Azure Storage, Application Gateway, or workloads behind an internal load balancer.\n\nTraffic from end users still enters through Front Door’s globally distributed POPs, benefiting from features like SSL offload, caching, and WAF protection. However, instead of routing to your origin over public, internet-facing, endpoints, Front Door uses the private Microsoft backbone to reach the private endpoint. This ensures that all traffic between Front Door and your origin remains isolated from external networks.\n\nThe private endpoint connection requires approval from the origin resource owner, adding an extra layer of control. Once approved, the origin can restrict public access entirely, enforcing that all traffic flows through Private Link.\n\n![]()\n\nPrivate Link integration brings following **benefits:**\n\n- *Enhanced Security:* By removing public exposure of backend services, Private Link significantly reduces the risk of DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access.\n- *Compliance and Governance:* Many regulatory frameworks mandate private connectivity for sensitive workloads. Private Link helps meet these requirements without sacrificing global availability.\n- *Performance and Reliability:* Traffic between Front Door and your origin travels over Microsoft’s high-speed backbone network, delivering low latency and consistent performance compared to public internet paths.\n- *Defense in Depth:* Combined with Web Application Firewall (WAF), TLS encryption, and DDoS protection, Private Link strengthens your security posture across multiple layers.\n- *Isolation and Control:* Resource owners maintain control over connection approvals, ensuring that only authorized Front Door profiles can access the origin.\n- *Integration with Hybrid Architectures:* For scenarios involving AKS clusters, custom APIs, or workloads behind internal load balancers, Private Link enables secure connectivity without requiring public IPs or complex VPN setups.\n\nPrivate Link transforms Azure Front Door from a global entry point into a fully private delivery mechanism for your applications, aligning with modern security principles and enterprise compliance needs.\n\n**Example:** Our application is now placed behind Azure Front Door. We are combining a public backend endpoint and Private Link integration, to show both in action in a single example. The Sweden Central origin endpoint is the public IPv6 endpoint of the regional External Load Balancers and the origin in US East 2 is connected via Private Link integration\n\nThe global FQDN `ipv6webapp-d4f4euhnb8fge4ce.b01.azurefd.net` and clients will use this FQDN to access the application regardless of their geographical location. The FQDN resolves to Front Door's global anycast address, and the internet will route client requests to the nearest Microsoft edge from this address is advertised. Front Door will then transparently route the request to the nearest origin deployment in Azure. Although public endpoints are used in this example, that traffic will be route over the Microsoft network.\n\nFrom a client in Europe:\n\n![]()\n\nCalling the application's api endpoint on `ipv6webapp-d4f4euhnb8fge4ce.b01.azurefd.net/api/region` shows some more detail.\n\n``` { \"region\": \"SwedenCentral\", \"clientIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\", \"xForwardedFor\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\", \"remoteAddress\": \"2a01:111:2053:d801:0:afd:ad4:1b28\", \"isPrivateIP\": false, \"expressIp\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\", \"connectionInfo\": { \"remoteAddress\": \"2a01:111:2053:d801:0:afd:ad4:1b28\", \"remoteFamily\": \"IPv6\", \"localAddress\": \"2001:db8:1:1::4\", \"localPort\": 80 }, \"allHeaders\": { \"x-forwarded-for\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\", \"x-azure-clientip\": \"2001:1c04:3404:9500:fd9b:58f4:1fb2:db21\" }, \"deploymentAdvice\": \"Public IP detected successfully\"} ```\n\n\"remoteAddress\": \"2a01:111:2053:d801:0:afd:ad4:1b28\" is the address from which Front Door sources its request to the origin.\n\nFrom a client in the US:\n\n![]()\n\nThe detailed view shows that the IP address calling the backend instance now is local VNET address. Private Link sources traffic coming in from a local address taken from the VNET it is in. The original client IP address is again preserved in the X-Forwarded-For header.\n\n``` { \"region\": \"eastus2\", \"clientIp\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\", \"xForwardedFor\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\", \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.2.1.5\", \"isPrivateIP\": false, \"expressIp\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\", \"connectionInfo\": { \"remoteAddress\": \"::ffff:10.2.1.5\", \"remoteFamily\": \"IPv6\", \"localAddress\": \"::ffff:10.2.2.68\", \"localPort\": 80 }, \"allHeaders\": { \"x-forwarded-for\": \"2603:1030:501:23::68:55658\" }, \"deploymentAdvice\": \"Public IP detected successfully\"} ```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIPv6 adoption for web applications is no longer optional. It is essential as public IPv4 address space is depleted, mobile networks increasingly use IPv6 only and governments mandate IPv6 reachability for public services. Azure's comprehensive dual-stack networking capabilities provide a clear path forward, enabling organizations to leverage IPv6 externally without sacrificing IPv4 compatibility or requiring complete infrastructure overhauls.\n\nAzure's externally facing services — including Application Gateway, External Load Balancer, Global Load Balancer, and Front Door — support IPv6 frontends, while Application Gateway and Front Door maintain IPv4 backend connectivity. This architecture allows applications to remain unchanged while instantly becoming accessible to IPv6-only clients.\n\nFor single-region deployments, Application Gateway offers layer-7 features like SSL termination and WAF protection. External Load Balancer provides high-performance layer-4 distribution. Multi-region scenarios benefit from Traffic Manager's DNS-based routing combined with regional Application Gateways, or the superior performance and failover capabilities of Global Load Balancer's anycast addressing.\n\nAzure Front Door provides global IPv6 delivery with edge optimization, built-in security, and seamless failover across Microsoft's network. Private Link integration allows secure global IPv6 distribution while maintaining backend isolation.\n\nThe transition to IPv6 application delivery on Azure is straightforward: enable dual-stack addressing on virtual networks, configure IPv6 frontends on load balancing services, and update DNS records. With Application Gateway or Front Door, backend applications require no modifications. These Azure services handle the IPv4-to-IPv6 translation seamlessly. This approach ensures both immediate IPv6 accessibility and long-term architectural flexibility as IPv6 adoption accelerates globally.",
