  "Description": "We’re excited to announce the general availability of the Responses API in Azure AI Foundry, making it easier than ever for developers to build intelligent, tool-using agents with stateful, multi-turn conversations—all in a single API call.\n\nSince we introduced the Responses API in public preview, customers have been using it to create agents that reason, call tools, and return structured outputs without complex orchestration code. Now, with GA, the API is production-ready and supports the full range of popular OpenAI models, including the GPT-5 series and fine-tuned models, along with a rich set of built-in tools to accelerate development.\n\n![]()\n\n### Growing momentum since preview\n\nSince preview, we’ve seen rapid adoption across industries as teams bring agentic workflows into their applications:\n\n**UiPath,** a leader in enterprise automation, is using the Responses API in their agentic automation platform that combines advanced reasoning with built-in tools like **computer use.** Agents built on UiPath Platform can interpret natural language instructions, decide on the right sequence of steps, and then execute actions directly across both modern SaaS applications, documents and legacy desktop software.\n\nWe’re also seeing strong momentum across other sectors. Financial institutions are using the API to power copilots that assist employees with research and compliance tasks. Healthcare providers are applying it to summarize and analyze medical documents securely. Retailers are embedding lightweight agents into apps to help employees and customers complete everyday tasks faster.\n\nFrom automating customer service workflows, to powering internal copilots, to enabling complex document analysis, developers are choosing the Responses API for its simplicity and speed to value.\n\n### Purpose-built for agentic workflows\n\nThe Responses API is designed specifically to make **agent development faster, simpler, and more reliable**—removing the need for complex orchestration code and custom state management.\n\nWith a single API call, developers can:\n\n- **Maintain multi-turn state automatically** – Agents remember previous turns and decisions without manual context passing, enabling more natural, ongoing conversations.\n- **Call multiple tools in a single flow** – The API stitches tool calls, model reasoning, and outputs together in the background, ensuring agents respond faster and more accurately.\n- **Support for all popular Azure OpenAI models** – From rapid prototyping with the latest **GPT-5 series** models to deploying **fine-tuned models** for domain-specific tasks.\n- **Scale confidently** – Built on Azure’s enterprise-grade identity, security, and compliance foundation, the Responses API is ready for production from day one.\n\nThe result: you can focus on **what your agent does**—not on building infrastructure to hold it together.\n\n### Rich set of built-in tools\n\nThe Responses API includes a broad and growing library of **foundation tools** so you can quickly extend your agent’s capabilities without building everything from scratch:\n\n- **File Search** – Ground responses in unstructured content, enabling precise, source-cited answers.\n- **Function Calling** – Call custom APIs or business logic directly from the model, with robust JSON schema validation for predictable outputs.\n- **Code Interpreter (Python tool)** – Run code securely to analyze datasets, transform files, or execute calculations—ideal for analytical and data-heavy workflows.\n- **Computer Use** – Automate UI interactions on desktop or in a browser from natural language commands, bridging agents into legacy apps and SaaS systems.\n- **Image Generation** – Generate or edit images in-line with text output for creative and design workflows.\n- **Remote MCP Server** – Connect to any external MCP-compatible tools to tap into your own tool ecosystem or community-built integrations.\n\nThese tools are **deeply integrated** with the Responses API—meaning agents can decide which tools to call, when to call them, and how to combine results, all within the same conversation context.\n\n### Part of the Azure AI Foundry agent development stack\n\nThe **Responses API** is the fastest way to start building intelligent, tool-using agents—perfect for single-agent experiences that leverage built-in tools, maintain multi-turn state, and work with popular OpenAI models, including GPT-5 and fine-tuned models.\n\nWhen you need to orchestrate multiple agents, integrate with enterprise systems like SharePoint, Bing, or Microsoft Fabric, or run long-lived workflows, [**Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview) provides those capabilities—along with AgentOps features such as observability, debugging, and secure deployment.\n\nFor developers seeking fine-grained control during prototyping, **Semantic Kernel** and **AutoGen** offer open-source flexibility to design, test, and customize agents locally, with a consistent path to deploy in Foundry. Together, these offerings give you a complete, interoperable stack for agent development—meeting your needs from first prototype to enterprise scale.\n\n### Start building today\n\nThe Responses API is now available in all supported regions and ready for production use. You can start building in the [Azure AI Foundry](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai.azure.com)and [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/responses?tabs=python-secure).\n\nWe can’t wait to see what you build.",
