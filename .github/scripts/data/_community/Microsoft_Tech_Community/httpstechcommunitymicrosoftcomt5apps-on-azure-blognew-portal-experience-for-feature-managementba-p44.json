  "EnhancedContent": "## Azure App Configuration's Feature manager gets a new look with three scenario-based feature flag creation journey that starts with intent.\n\nFeature flags have become an essential tool for modern software development, enabling teams to deploy code safely, control feature rollouts, and experiment with new functionality without the risk of breaking production environments. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into applications— from LLM-powered features to model version management— the need for safe, controlled deployments has never been more critical. The previous experience forced you to make a decision upfront: should I create a feature flag or a variant feature flag? What's the difference between these options? Which one do I need for my use case? Did I make a wrong choice? Do I need to delete and start over?\n\nOur new portal experience starts with your goal instead of requiring deep knowledge of feature flag architecture. **The new experience asks you: What will you be using your feature flag for?**\n\n### Scenarios That Match How You Think\n\n**When you select a scenario, the portal dynamically adjusts to reveal only the relevant configuration tabs and options.**Switch shows straightforward toggle controls, Rollout presents percentage and targeting options, and Experiment allows variant allocation and traffic distribution settings. Let's dive deeper into how they fit into your needs.\n\n#### Switch: \"I need an on/off toggle\"\n\nImmediate on/off control over features, that is commonly used for:\n\n- **Emergency kill switches**: Instantly disable problematic features or AI models in production\n- **Maintenance mode**: Toggle site-wide maintenance without deployments\n- **Feature gating**: Block access to beta features for non-beta users\n- **Debug modes**: Enable verbose logging or diagnostic features for troubleshooting\n- **Regional compliance**: Quickly disable features that conflict with local regulations\n- **Fallback mode**: Switch from AI-powered responses to rule-based responses during model downtime\n\n#### Rollout: \"I want to control who gets this and when\"\n\nGradual exposure with smart targeting for controlled feature releases that can be useful for:\n\n- **Canary deployments**: Start with 5% of users, gradually increase to 100%\n- **Geographic rollouts**: Launch multimodal AI in one region (e.g US-West), then expand based on language model performance\n- **Subscription tiers**: Give premium features to paid users first (e.g provide RAG-enhanced search to enterprise users)\n- **Employee dogfooding**: Internal testing before customer release, test new LLM-powered features with employees before customer release\n- **Time-based releases**: Automatically activate features during business hours\n- **Load testing**: Gradually increase traffic to stress-test new infrastructure\n\n#### Experiment: \"I want to make informed data-driven decisions\"\n\n**Here's the key**: You don't necessarily *have* to run statistical experiments. Beyond A/B testing, this scenario can be applied if you have multiple variants of something - different algorithms, UI layouts, configurations, or business logic paths - and is typically utilized for:\n\n**Statistical Analysis, A/B Testing & Experiments:**\n\n- **Conversion optimization**: Test different checkout flows to measure completion rates\n- **UI/UX experiments**: Compare button colors, layouts, or copy to optimize user engagement\n- **Model comparison**: Compare Claude vs GPT-4 vs Gemini for completion rates and accuracy\n- **Pricing strategy tests**: Evaluate different pricing models with statistical significance\n- **Algorithm performance**: Compare recommendation engines using click-through rates and revenue metrics\n\n**Configuration & Variant Management:**\n\n- **Configuration management**: Serve different API timeout values to different regions\n- **Feature variants**: Offer basic/premium/enterprise feature sets through one flag\n- **Model routing**: Route traffic between fine-tuned model, base model, and RAG-enhanced model based on query complexity\n- **Content personalization**: Show different onboarding flows based on user characteristics (e.g show different system instructions based on user expertise level for prompt personalization)\n- **Multi-tenant customization**: Serve tenant-specific configurations and behaviors\n\n> >\n> Telemetry can be enabled in all scenarios if your App Configuration store is connected to an App Insights Workspace. This update doesn't change how your existing flags work, the scenario-based approach simply improves new flag creation process on the Azure App Configuration Portal.\n> >\n\n### Experience the new approach today:\n\n1.
