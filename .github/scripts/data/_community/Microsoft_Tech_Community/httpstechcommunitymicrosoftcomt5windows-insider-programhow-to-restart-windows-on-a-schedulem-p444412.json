Since it's remote, I thought it would be a good idea to restart it once a day at midnight, just in case something goes wrong and I won't be there to press the power button. I accomplished this by using the Task Scheduler to run the \"shutdown.exe\" program with the arguments \"-r -f -t\". However, I have lost remote access to my Windows computer. It's offline. I suspect that it forced shutdown during a Windows update. So, my question is this: Is there a proper way to schedule regular reboots for a Windows computer? In the Windows update settings, I saw an option to reboot the computer after an update outside of active hours. This could work if the updates are regularly periodic. Any ideas?",
