  "EnhancedContent": "## We are excited to announce the Multicloud connector enabled by Azure Arc now supports GCP environments enabling customers to view and manage their cross-cloud workloads!\n\nWe are excited to announce that the Multicloud connector is now in preview for GCP environments. With the Multicloud connector, you can easily connect your GCP projects and AWS accounts to Azure with the following capabilities:\n\n- [Inventory](https://aka.ms/multi-cloud-inventory): Get an up-to-date, comprehensive view of your cloud assets across different cloud providers. Now supporting GCP services (Compute VM, GKE, Storage, Functions, and more), you can now gain insights into your Azure, AWS, and GCP environments in a single pane of glass. The agentless inventory solution will periodically scan your GCP environment, project the discovered resources in GCP as Azure resources, including all of the GCP metadata like GCP labels. Now, you can easily view, query, and tag these resources from a centralized location.\n\n- [Azure Arc onboarding](https://aka.ms/multicloud-arc-onboarding): Automatically Arc-enable your existing and future GCP VMs so you can leverage Azure and Microsoft services, like Azure Monitor and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Through the multicloud connector, the Azure Arc agent will be automatically installed for machines that meet the [prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/multicloud-connector/onboard-multicloud-vms-arc#prerequisites).\n\n**How do I get started?**\n\nYou can easily set up the multicloud connector by following our [getting started guide](https://aka.ms/multicloud-connector-create) which provides step by step instructions on creating the connector and setting up the permissions in GCP which leveraged OIDC federation.\n\n**What can I do after my connector is set up?**\n\nWith the inventory offering, you can see and query for all of your GCP and Azure resources via Azure Resource Graph.\n\nFor Azure Arc onboarding, you can apply the Azure management services on your EC2 instances that are Arc-enabled.
