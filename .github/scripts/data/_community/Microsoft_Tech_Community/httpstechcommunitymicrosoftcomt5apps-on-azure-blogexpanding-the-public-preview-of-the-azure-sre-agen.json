  "Description": "We are excited to share that the **Azure SRE Agent** is now available in **public preview** **for everyone instantly â€“ no sign up required.**\n\nA big thank you to all our preview customers who provided feedback and [helped shape this release](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/enterprise-ready-and-extensible-update-on-the-azure-sre-agent-preview/4444299)! Watching teams put the SRE Agent to work taught us a ton, and weâ€™ve baked those lessons into a smarter, more resilient, and enterprise-ready experience. You can now find Azure SRE Agent directly in the Azure Portal and get started, or use the link below.\n\nðŸ“– [Learn more about SRE Agent](https://aka.ms/sreagent/docs). ðŸ‘‰ [Create your first SRE Agent](https://aka.ms/sreagent-portal)*(Azure login required)*\n\n## **Whatâ€™s New in Azure SRE Agent - October Update**\n\nThe Azure SRE Agent now delivers secure-by-default governance, deeper diagnostics, and extensible automationâ€”built for scale. It can even resolve incidents autonomously by following your teamâ€™s runbooks. With native integrations across Azure Monitor, GitHub, ServiceNow, and PagerDuty, it supports root cause analysis using both source code and historical patterns. And since September 1, [billing and reporting](https://aka.ms/sreagent/pricing/blog) are available via Azure Agent Units (AAUs). Please visit [product documentation](https://aka.ms/sreagent/docs) for the latest updates.\n\nHere are a few highlights for this month:\n\n**Prioritizing enterprise governance and security:** By default, the Azure SRE Agent operates with least-privilege access and never executes write actions on Azure resources without explicit human approval. Additionally, it uses role-based access control (RBAC) so organizations can assign read-only or approver roles, providing clear oversight and traceability from day one. This allows teams to choose their desired level of autonomy from read-only insights to approval-gated actions to full automation without compromising control.\n\n![]()\n\n**Covering the breadth and depth of Azure:** The Azure SRE Agent helps teams manage and understand their entire Azure footprint. With built-in support for **AZ CLI** and **kubectl**, it works across all Azure services. But it doesnâ€™t stop thereâ€”diagnostics are enhanced for platforms like **PostgreSQL, API Management, Azure Functions, AKS, Azure Container Apps, and Azure App Service**. Whether you're running microservices or managing monoliths, the agent delivers consistent automation and deep insights across your cloud environment.\n\n![]()\n\n****\n\n**Automating Incident Management:** The Azure SRE Agent now plugs directly into **Azure Monitor, PagerDuty, and ServiceNow** to streamline incident detection and resolution. These integrations let the Agent ingest alerts and trigger workflows that match your teamâ€™s existing toolsâ€”so you can respond faster, with less manual effort.\n\n![]()\n\n**Engineered for extensibility:** The Azure SRE Agent incident management approach lets teams reuse existing runbooks and customize response plans to fit their unique workflows. Whether you want to keep a human in the loop or empower the Agent to autonomously mitigate and resolve issues, the choice is yours. This flexibility gives teams the freedom to evolveâ€”from guided actions to trusted autonomyâ€”without ever giving up control.\n\n![]()\n\n**Root cause, meet source code:** The Azure SRE Agent now supports code-aware root cause analysis (RCA) by linking diagnostics directly to source context in **GitHub and Azure DevOps**. This tight integration helps teams trace incidents back to the exact code changes that triggered themâ€”accelerating resolution and boosting confidence in automated responses. By bridging operational signals with engineering workflows, the agent makes RCA faster, clearer, and more actionable.\n\n![]()\n\n**Close the loop with DevOps:** The Azure SRE Agent now generates incident summary reports directly in GitHub and Azure DevOpsâ€”complete with diagnostic context. These reports can be assigned to a [GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent), which automatically creates pull requests and merges validated fixes. Every incident becomes an actionable code change, driving permanent resolution instead of temporary mitigation.\n\n![]()\n\n**Getting Started**\n\n- Start here: [Create a new SRE Agent in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/sreagent-portal) *(Azure login required)*\n- Blog: [Announcing a flexible, predictable billing model for Azure SRE Agent](https://aka.ms/sreagent/pricing/blog)\n- Blog: [Enterprise-ready and extensible â€“ Update on the Azure SRE Agent preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/enterprise-ready-and-extensible-update-on-the-azure-sre-agent-preview/4444299)\n- [Product documentation](https://aka.ms/sreagent/docs)\n- [Product home page](http://www.azure.com/sreagent)\n\n## **Community & Support**\n\nWeâ€™d love to hear from you!
