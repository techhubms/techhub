This makes it easier than ever for organizations to unlock and scale the power of their Genie spaces across the Microsoft ecosystem (e.g., Teams), ultimately democratizing trusted data and insights to business users.\n\nAI/BI Genie opens the power of conversational analytics to everyone in the organization. A user can ask a question such as “What is my revenue growth this month?” and Genie interprets the intent, generates the appropriate query, and returns the data insight. Users can also review the underlying logic for transparency. By supporting iterative questioning, Genie enables users to investigate their data directly and build confidence in their understanding without requiring code or specialist intervention.\n\n**The Challenge Before: Complex setup via Custom Code**\n\nPreviously, connecting Genie to the Microsoft ecosystem was challenging. Organizations had to develop custom connections to manage API flows, which added architectural overhead. This complexity limited organizations’ ability to distribute Genie’s trusted insights efficiently across Microsoft platforms.\n\n**What’s Now Possible:  Unlock the value of Microsoft Ecosystem**\n\nThe new integrations between Genie and Copilot Studio, as well as Genie and Microsoft Foundry, solve these challenges by providing easy and secure ways to connect each platform. Additionally, by leveraging MCP, updates to the underlying Genie APIs are seamlessly managed for users, eliminating the need to modify your integration.\n\n**Genie + Copilot Studio**\n\n- Connect a Genie space to a Copilot Studio Agent as a tool (over MCP)\n- Instantly make Genie’s trusted insights available in Teams or M365 Copilot by publishing Genie enabled Copilot Studio agents\n- Genie’s complete context of a customer’s data estate will enable Copilot Studio agents to deliver richer, more accurate responses\n\n**Genie + Microsoft Foundry**\n\n- Connect a Genie space to Foundry as a tool (over MCP)\n- Instantly make Genie’s trusted insights available to developers building agents using Foundry\n\n**How It Works: Genie + Copilot Studio**\n\n1. Create a connection to your Azure Databricks workspace in Power Apps, using OAuth or a Microsoft Entra ID Service Principal\n2. Open Copilot Studio\n3. Select an existing Copilot Studio  agent or create a new one\n4. Open ‘Tools’, click ‘+Add a tool’, and search for “Azure Databricks Genie” or find it within the Model Context Protocol section\n5. Select the Genie space to connect and configure the connection\n\nNote: It’s important to give your Genie space a clear title and description so the Copilot Studio agent can effectively orchestrate requests.\n\nAfter completing the steps above, you are ready to go and can publish the agent to channels, such as Microsoft Teams, to easily distribute the value of Genie to your organization.\n\n**How It Works: Genie + Microsoft Foundry Portal**\n\n1. Open Microsoft Foundry\n2. Go to the tool catalog within the Discover tab\n3. Select ‘Azure Databricks Genie’\n4. Configure the connection your Azure Databricks Genie space and click ‘Connect’\n5. Click ‘Use in an agent’ and select the desired agent to connect your Genie space to\n\nOnce completed, Genie is available for use in your Foundry agent!\n\nTry It Out: Get started with Genie in Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry\n\n- To get started with Genie + Copilot Studio, check out our [technical documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/msft-power-platform)\n- To get started with Genie + Microsoft Foundry, check out the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/azure-ai-foundry)\n- To learn more about the Generally Available Azure Databricks Power Platform connector explore this [blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-azure-databricks-power-platform-connector-unleashing-governed-real-time-data-power)\n\nPublished Nov 18, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure databricks](/tag/azure%20databricks?nodeId=board%3AAnalyticsonAzure)\n\n[!\\[AnaviNahar&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS04MDM5OTktQlh3V0lu?image-coordinates=0%2C64%2C670%2C735&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/anavinahar/803999) [AnaviNahar](/users/anavinahar/803999) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined September 22, 2020\n\n[View Profile](/users/anavinahar/803999)\n\n/category/azure/blog/analyticsonazure [Analytics on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/analyticsonazure) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
