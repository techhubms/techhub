  "Description": "In February, we announced that Automatic Identity Management in public preview and loved to hear your overwhelmingly positive feedback. Prior to public preview, you either had to set up an Entra Enterprise Application or involve an Azure Databricks account admin to import the appropriate groups. This required manual steps whether it was adding or removing users with organizational changes, maintaining scripts, or requiring additional Entra or SCIM configuration. Identity management was thus cumbersome and required management overhead.\n\nToday, we are excited to announce that Automatic Identity management (AIM) for Entra ID on Azure Databricks is **generally available**. This means no manual user setup is needed and you can instantly add users to your workspace(s). Users, groups, and service principals from Microsoft Entra ID are automatically available within Azure Databricks, including support for nested groups and dashboards.\n\nThis native integration is one of the many reasons [Databricks runs best on Azure.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/databricks-runs-best-on-azure/)\n\n![]()\n\nHere are some addition ways AIM could benefit you and your organization:\n\n**Seamlessly share dashboards**\n\nYou can share AI/BI dashboards with any user, service principal, or group in Microsoft Entra ID immediately as these users are automatically added to the Azure Databricks account upon login. Members of Microsoft Entra ID who do not have access to the workspace are granted access to a view-only copy of a dashboard published with embedded credentials. This enables you to share dashboards with users outside your organization, too. To learn more, see [share a dashboard.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dashboards/share)\n\n![]()\n\n**Updated defaults for new accounts**\n\nAll new Azure Databricks accounts have AIM enabled – no opt in or additional configuration required. For existing accounts, you can enable AIM with a single click in the Account Admin Console. Soon, we will also make this the default for existing accounts.\n\n**Automation at scale enabled via APIs**\n\nYou can also register users, groups, or service principles in Microsoft Entra ID via APIs. Being able to do this programmatically enables the enterprise scale most of our customers need. You can also enable automation via scripts leveraging these APIs.\n\nRead the Databricks blog [here](https://www.databricks.com/blog/automatic-identity-management-entra-id-now-generally-available-azure-databricks) and get started via [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/automatic-identity-management) today!",
