  "Description": "### What’s New?\n\nThe updated experience introduces a dedicated App Service Quota blade in the Azure portal, offering a streamlined and intuitive interface to:\n\n- View current usage and limits across the various SKUs\n- Set custom quotas tailored to your App Service plan needs\n\nThis new experience empowers developers and IT admins to proactively manage resources, avoid service disruptions, and optimize performance.\n\n### Quick Reference - Start here!\n\n1. If your deployment requires quota for ten or more subscriptions, then file a support ticket with problem type Quota.\n2. If any subscription included in your request requires zone redundancy, then file a support ticket with problem type Quota.\n3. Otherwise, leverage the new self-service experience to increase your quota automatically.\n\n### Self-service Quota Requests\n\nFor non-zone-redundant needs, quota alone is sufficient to enable App Service deployment or scale-out. Follow the provided steps to place your request.\n\n##### 1. Navigate to the Quotas resource provider in the Azure portal\n\n![]()\n\n##### 2. Select App Service\n\n![]()\n\n###### Navigating the primary interface:\n\n1. Each App Service VM size is represented as a separate SKU. If the intention is to be able to scale up or down within a specific offering (e.g., Premium v3), then equivalent number of VMs need to be requested for each applicable size of that offering (e.g., request 5 instances for both P1v3 and P3v3).\n2. As with other quotas, you can filter by region, subscription, provider, or usage.\n3. You can also group the results by usage, quota (App Service VM type), or location (region).\n4. Current usage is represented as App Service VMs. This allows you to quickly identify which SKUs are nearing their quota limits.\n5. Adjustments can be made inline: no need to visit another page. This is covered in detail in the next section.\n\n![]()\n\n##### 3. Request quota adjustments\n\nClicking the pen icon opens a flyout window to capture the quota request:\n\n![]()\n\nThe quota type (App Service SKU) is already populated, along with current usage. Note that your request is not incremental: you must specify the new limit that you wish to see reflected in the portal. For example, to request two additional instances of P1v2 VMs, you would file the request like this:\n\n![]()\n\nClick submit to send the request for automatic processing.\n\n###### How quota approvals work:\n\nImmediately upon submitting a quota request, you will see a processing dialog like the one shown:\n\n![]()\n\nIf the quota request can be automatically fulfilled, then no support request is needed. You should receive this confirmation within a few minutes of submission:\n\n![]()\n\nIf the request cannot be automatically fulfilled, then you will be given the option to file a support request with the same information. In the example below, the requested new limit exceeds what can be automatically granted for the region:\n\n![]()\n\n##### 4. If applicable, create support ticket\n\nWhen creating a support ticket, you will need to repopulate the Region and App Service plan details; the new limit has already been populated for you.\n\n![]()\n\nIf you forget the region or SKU that was requested, you can reference them in your notifications pane:\n\n![]()\n\nIf you choose to create a support ticket, then you will interact with the capacity management team for that region. This is a 24x7 service, so requests may be created at any time. Once you have filed the support request, you can track its status via the [Help + support dashboard](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview).\n\n#### Known issues\n\nThe self-service quota request experience for App Service is in public preview. Here are some caveats worth mentioning while the team finalizes the release for general availability:\n\n- Closing the quota request flyout window will stop meaningful notifications for that request. You can still view the outcome of your quota requests by checking actual quota, but if you want to rely on notifications for alerts, then we recommend leaving the quota request window open for the few minutes that it is processing.\n- Some SKUs are not yet represented in the quota dashboard. These will be added later in the public preview.\n- The Activity Log does not currently provide a meaningful summary of previous quota requests and their outcomes. This will also be addressed during the public preview.\n- As noted in the walkthrough, the new experience does not enable zone-redundant deployments. Quota is an inherently regional construct, and zone-redundant enablement requires a separate step that can only be taken in response to a support ticket being filed.\n- Quota API documentation is being drafted to enable bulk non-zone redundant quota requests without requiring you to file a support ticket.\n\n### Filing a Support Ticket\n\nIf your deployment requires zone redundancy or contains many subscriptions, then we recommend filing a support ticket with issue type \"Technical\" and problem type \"Quota\":\n\n![]()\n\n### We want your feedback!\n\nIf you notice any aspect of the experience that does not work as expected, or you have feedback on how to make it better, please use the comments below to share your thoughts!",
