  "EnhancedContent": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a WPF app that runs from a network drive. It works fine on Windows 11 at the office. But when users run it through Remote Desktop on a Windows Server 2019 virtual machine (using the exact same .exe from the same network drive location), some of them get an error when opening a new window.\n\nThe app starts normally, but the error happens only when opening another window — and not for every user.\n\nStrangely, the next day the same user can open the app and use it normally again without changing anything.\n\nHas anyone seen this before or know how to fix it?\n\nI’ve also attached:\n\n- A screenshot of the error message\n\n- The function that causes the error\n\nThanks a lot!",
