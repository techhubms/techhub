  "EnhancedContent": "We are excited to introduce the public preview of smart tier for Azure Blob and Azure Data Lake Storage. Smart tier is a fully managed, automated data tiering solution that takes the guesswork and manual effort out of optimizing your storage costs.\n\nSmart tier continuously analyzes your data’s access patterns and automatically moves objects between the hot, cool, and cold tiers. Smart tier will keep regularly accessed objects on the hot capacity tier to optimize transaction costs and moves inactive objects after 30 days to the cool tier capacity tier and after an additional 60 days of inactivity to the cold capacity tier. If you access an object in cool or cold tiers again, it’s instantly promoted back to the hot tier, restarting the cycle. This ensures your data is always in the most cost-effective tier with zero manual intervention, making it the ideal online tier for datasets with mixed or unknown access patterns.\n\n**Getting started**\n\nUsing smart tier is quick and easy:\n\n- **Enabling smart tier is simple:** Just [select smart tier](https://aka.ms/BlobSmarttier) as the default access tier through the storage account configuration for any storage account with zonal redundancy. Smart tier is available in all zonal public cloud regions, supporting both flat and hierarchical namespaces.\n- **Billing is straightforward:** You will pay the regular hot, cool, and cold capacity rates, with no extra charges for tier transitions, early deletion, or data retrieval. Even moving existing objects into smart tier does not incur tier change fees. There’s just a small monitoring fee for the orchestration.\n\nSmart tier is configured at the account level. It can be configured via API or the Azure portal as the default access tier setting for new and existing storage accounts. Existing objects following the default access tier setting from the account will be moved to smart tier automatically. Objects that are explicitly tiered, i.e. to the hot tier, will remain in the same account and will not be moved to other capacity tiers. Smart tier will always keep small objects that are below 128 KiB in size in the hot capacity tier for efficiency and those objects will not incur a monitoring charge. If objects below 128 KiB increase in size, the smart tiering patterns apply for those objects as well.\n\nThe automatic down tiering of inactive data, paired with the billing model simplifications of Smart tier can lead to large cost savings over time. In the metrics view of the storage account you can see the distribution across the capacity tiers for smart tiered objects by both object count and capacity.\n\nThis account shows smart tier in action, moving inactive objects to the cool and cold capacity tier, thereby drastically reducing the capacity charges without any manual intervention.\n\n*\"2 years ago, Qumulo partnered with Microsoft to deliver the first truly elastic, unlimited capacity, fully managed file system, Azure Native Qumulo, which was built on Azure Blob,\"*said Brandon Whitelaw SVP of Product at Qumulo*. \"Qumulo shared feedback with Microsoft on our ideal solution for data tiering and Microsoft clearly delivered, meeting all expectations. With today's smart tier announcement, Qumulo will immediately enhance our offerings with these new capabilities, delivering greater functionality and control over data lifecycle management.

Smart tier is the ideal tier to choose when you are looking to store your data on standard online tiers but are not fully aware of the data access patterns or do not want to manage data transitions across online tiers.
