  "Description": "Hi,\n\nWe are currently investigating an issue in an Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environment where users are intermittently disconnected during sign-in or are unable to reconnect to their sessions.\n\nEnvironment: Azure Virtual Desktop Host pool: Pooled OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session FSLogix enabled Client: Windows App (Remote Desktop)\n\nError message seen by users: \"Your Remote Desktop Services session has ended. The administrator has ended the session, an error occurred while the connection was being established, or a network problem occurred.\"\n\nWhat we are seeing: Users fail to connect or get disconnected shortly after login. Session hosts appear healthy and powered on. No admin-initiated logoff is taking place. Rebooting the affected session host sometimes resolves the issue, but only temporarily.\n\nActions already taken: Restarted AVD agent services on the session hosts. Placed affected hosts in drain mode. Rebooted the VMs.\n\nWhat we suspect: Some users may still have active or disconnected sessions on previous session hosts, possibly combined with FSLogix profile locks, which could be preventing new sessions from starting correctly.\n\nQuestions: What is the recommended way to identify which users are logged into which session hosts across a pooled host pool? Are there best practices using the Azure Portal or PowerShell to detect and clean up stuck or disconnected sessions? Has anyone seen similar behavior in pooled AVD environments with Windows 10/11 and FSLogix enabled?\n\nAny advice or pointers would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.",
