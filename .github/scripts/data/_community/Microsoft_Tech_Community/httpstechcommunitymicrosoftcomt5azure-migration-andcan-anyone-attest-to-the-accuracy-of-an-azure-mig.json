  "Description": "Hello! I've only created a **business case** in a simple lab environment using 5 on-prem Hyper-V servers. (*SmartHotelHost* lab from Github) The business case export explains that I'll be saving over $100K annually once fully migrated into Azure after multiple years. (It's only 5 servers!) That said, I've been reluctant to suggest the Business Case tool and steer clients toward the **Azure Migrate Assessment** and **Azure Pricing Calculator** which have proven to be reliable tools.\n\nAnyone have any experience with the business case? Was it accurate?\n\nThanks a bunch!\n\nRich",
