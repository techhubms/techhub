  "Description": "Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern that enables applications to respond to real-time events rather than relying on traditional request-response communication. In the cloud-native ecosystem, EDA is particularly powerful for building scalable, loosely coupled, and resilient solutions. Azure provides a robust set of services to implement event-based design, ensuring seamless integration and high availability.\n\n[https://dellenny.com/event-based-design-architecture-pattern-in-azure/](https://dellenny.com/event-based-design-architecture-pattern-in-azure/)",
