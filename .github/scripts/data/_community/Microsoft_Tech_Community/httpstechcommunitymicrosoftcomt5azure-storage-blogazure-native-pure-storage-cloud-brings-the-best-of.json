  "Description": "[Azure Native Integrations](https://aka.ms/azurenativeisvs) tightly couple partner solutions to the Azure management experience allowing you to deploy and operate industry-leading solutions like [Pure Storage Cloud](https://aka.ms/ani/purestorage) with the same tools and methodology you use with Azure services like virtual machines, storage accounts, and Azure Kubernetes Service clusters.\n\n# Azure Storage Partners meet every need\n\nAzure provides a broad portfolio of block, file and object storage solutions but we realize that our customers may have an existing hybrid cloud dependency or unique feature requirement that only a validated ISV solution delivers. As a result, we dedicate engineering resources to work with our partners to design and build optimized solutions for our joint customers built on the foundation of Azure Services. I am proud of the work we did with the Pure Storage team to develop a first-in-public-cloud enterprise block storage service. Azure Native Pure Storage Cloud is the culmination of the dedicated team from Pure Storage, the Azure Native Integration, and Azure Storage teams.

Pure has closely aligned with our Compute, Network, and Storage engineering teams to test and validate new Azure features that will benefit our mutual customers. Pure’s early access to and support of Azure Boost enabled VMs, Shared Disks, and Premium Managed SSD v2 has allowed them to provide a cost-effective and performant service.
