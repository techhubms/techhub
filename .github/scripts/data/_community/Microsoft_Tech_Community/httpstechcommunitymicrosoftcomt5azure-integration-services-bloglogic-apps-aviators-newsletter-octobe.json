What are your responsibilities?\n\nMy role is Business and Marketing Manager at Contica. My main responsibility is helping our customers translate business challenges into technical solutions. I come from a technical background as a BizTalk and Azure developer and architect, so I have one foot in the technical world and the other in the business side.\n\n##### Can you give us some insights into your day-to-day activities and what a typical day in your role looks like?\n\nOn any given day, I’m improving our customer offerings, diving into project challenges with colleagues, and exploring new technologies with Ahmed Bayoumy to find better ways of working. If I’m lucky, we’re recording a new episode of Integration Love Story with a community member/friend and learning from their life and tech experience.\n\n##### What motivates and inspires you to be an active member of the Aviators/Microsoft community?\n\nThe community itself. Since I started working with integration, I’ve always felt that people genuinely want to share their knowledge and experience. The people behind the blog posts that helped me grow as a junior integration developer have turned out to be some of the most humble and generous individuals I’ve met. Everyone is open to sharing their experiences in a kind and respectful way, and that’s incredibly motivating.\n\n##### Looking back, what advice do you wish you had been given earlier that you'd now share with those looking to get into STEM/technology?\n\nEveryone has been a beginner. Don’t be afraid to reach out, ask for help and most importantly, stay curious and lean into new technology. “The more you know, the more you realize you don’t know.” And that’s the beauty of it!\n\n##### What has helped you grow professionally?\n\nCuriosity and the drive to keep learning. I've been something of a \"Yes man\" when it comes to new challenges. And being in an environment where the people around you accept you for who you are, every day, that’s a recipe for real growth.\n\n##### If you had a magic wand that could create a feature in Logic Apps, what would it be and why?\n\nA built-in AI-powered \"next action suggestion” in your Logic App workflow based on other designs in your resource group or predefined business process in the same logic app standard that you are working one. A feature that would help me be more productivity!\n\n# News from our product group\n\n| | [Logic Apps Live September 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXIKrZt2iwE)<br><br><br>Missed Logic Apps Live in September?
