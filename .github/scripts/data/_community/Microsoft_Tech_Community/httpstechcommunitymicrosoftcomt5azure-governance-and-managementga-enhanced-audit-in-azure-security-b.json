This release brings powerful, audit-only capabilities to over¬†**1.6 million Linux devices** across all Azure regions, helping enterprise customers and IT administrators monitor and maintain secure configurations at scale.\n\n## What Is the Azure Security Baseline for Linux?\n\nThe Azure Security Baseline for Linux is a set of pre-configured security recommendations delivered through Azure Policy and Azure Machine Configuration. It enables organizations to continuously audit Linux virtual machines and Arc-enabled servers against industry-standard benchmarks‚Äîwithout enforcing changes or triggering auto-remediation.\n\nThis GA release focuses on **enhanced audit capabilities**, giving teams deep visibility into configuration drift and compliance gaps across their Linux estate. For our **remediation** experience, there is a limited public preview available here:¬†[What is the Azure security baseline for Linux? | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/osconfig/overview-baseline)\n\n## Why Enhanced Audit Matters\n\nIn today‚Äôs hybrid environments, maintaining compliance across diverse Linux distributions is a challenge. The enhanced audit mode provides:\n\n- **Granular insights** into each configuration check\n- **Industry aligned benchmark**¬†for standardized security posture\n- **Detailed rule-level reporting** with evidence and context\n- **Scalable deployment** across Azure and Arc-enabled machines\n\nWhether you're preparing for an audit, hardening your infrastructure, or simply tracking configuration drift, enhanced audit gives you the clarity and control you need‚Äîwithout enforcing changes.\n\n## Key Features at GA\n\n### ‚úÖ Broad Linux Distribution Support\n\nüìò Full distro list: [Supported Client Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview#supported-client-types)\n\n### üîç Industry-Aligned Audit Checks\n\nThe baseline audits over **200+ security controls per machine**, aligned to industry benchmarks such as CIS. These checks cover:\n\n- OS hardening\n- Network and firewall configuration\n- SSH and remote access settings\n- Logging and auditing\n- Kernel parameters and system services\n\nEach finding includes a description and the actual configuration state‚Äîmaking it easy to understand and act on.\n\n### üåê Hybrid Cloud Coverage\n\nThe baseline works across:\n\n- Azure virtual machines\n- Arc-enabled servers (on-premises or other clouds)\n\nThis means you can apply a consistent compliance standard across your entire Linux estate‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs in Azure, on-prem, or multi-cloud.\n\n### üß† Powered by Azure OSConfig\n\nThe audit engine is built on the open-source [Azure OSConfig](https://github.com/Azure/azure-osconfig/) framework, which performs Linux-native checks with minimal performance impact.
