  "Description": "The organisation I work for has moved away from WYSE 3040s with an on-premise RDS farm. We now use laptops, docks and Microsoft 365/SharePoint the whole thing. Intune management too.\n\nThis is working fine but I have had \"an idea\".\n\nI now have a box of some 30 old thin clients.\n\nWYSE 3040 Thin OS 9.1.4234\n\nCan I use a WYSE 3040 to connect straight to an Azure Virtual Desktop?\n\n**Reason**: We have some volunteer staff who come in to the office for just 2-3 hours one day a week.\n\nThey do basic processing of physical paper forms, updating spreadsheets, entering invoice details etc etc, boring but essential tasks. They dont need anything fancy.\n\nBUT ... We (a charity) cant afford to buy them a laptop for 2-3 hours a week.\n\nSo I have set up an AVD successfully, hoorah for me. I can access the AVD no problem using the Windows App on a Windows laptop or on a Mac device.\n\nCan I point a WYSE device straight at the AVD WITHOUT using Wyse Management Suite? The old WMS is on the local server which will be decommissioned. I dont want to use that.\n\nWhen I do a factory reset on a WYSE and go to configure Windows Virtual Desktop it does not seem to do anything. It does prompt me for MFA and does show our tenant welcome page background image so it is doing \"something\"\n\nHas anyone done this successfully?",
