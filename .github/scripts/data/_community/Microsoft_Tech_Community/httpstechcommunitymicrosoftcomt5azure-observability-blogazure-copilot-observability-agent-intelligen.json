We are introducing the **Azure Copilot observability agent** that materializes this promise. Azure Copilot observability agent extends and builds on top of what was previously known was the Azure Monitor investigation capability and introduces a slick experience, combining the power of agentic investigations with expanded capabilities for deeper visibility and faster resolution.\n\n**Smarter insights, faster recovery, deeper visibility across your Azure stack.**\n\n### **What it is**\n\nThe Azure Copilot observability agent works within your Azure workflows to make troubleshooting faster and smarter. It helps you:\n\n- **Automatically isolate problems** in complex applications across the stack\n- **Detect and correlate anomalies** from metrics, logs and other observability signals to help identify cause of an issue\n- **Correlate data from multiple sources** for full context.\n- **Generate actionable findings** and next steps described in clear human language.\n- **Preserve results** for collaboration and tracking.\n\nIntegrated with alerts, the Azure portal, and Azure Copilot (gated preview), the Azure Copilot observability agent ensures investigations are seamless and actionable.\n\n### **How it works**\n\nWhen you get an alert and need to investigate it quickly and take action, simply click on the ‘Investigate’ button. Next, you’ll see a list of AI-generated findings to select from. Each finding suggests possible causes behind what went wrong and offers a starting point for troubleshooting.\n\nIn order to get a better understanding of the summary, you can easily access the supporting Data.\n\nBehind the scenes, the observability agent uses the power of **AI, Machine learning models for anomaly detection and correlation, and large language models (LLMs)** to deliver these insights.\n\n### **Expanded intelligence for critical resources**\n\nThe Azure Copilot observability agent now delivers intelligent, AI-driven investigations across your Azure stack, from application services down to the underlying infrastructure. It automatically scopes from the resource to dependent components and infrastructure layers, correlating metrics, logs, and health signals for deeper visibility and faster root cause analysis. This includes support across a customer’s application services and critical Azure resources such as Virtual Machines (VM), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters, and more, providing true full-stack coverage for complex environments.\n\nFor these environments, investigations leverage multiple analysis types to deliver deeper insights:\n\n1. **Metric analysis -**detect abnormal CPU, memory, or network utilization patterns in VMs and AKS nodes, helping identify resource pressure before it impacts workloads.\n2. **Recent alerts correlation -**when a spike in AKS pod restarts occurs, the observability agent correlates with recent alerts to highlight cascading issues across cluster components.\n3. **Resource health checks -**surface health signals for VMs and AKS nodes alongside anomaly findings, enabling operators to validate whether infrastructure degradation is contributing to application instability.\n4. **Resource diagnostics tools integration -**findings are automatically connected to built-in Azure diagnostics for quick validation and remediation steps without leaving the investigation workflow\n5. **Log-based metric analysis -**for AKS and VM environments, enrich metric anomaly detection with contextual tags and data derived from logs, enabling more precise root cause identification.****\n\n### **Extended regional availability**\n\nThe Azure Copilot observability agent is now supported in [most Azure regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/aiops/aiops-issue-and-investigation-overview)[,](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/aiops/aiops-issue-and-investigation-overview) so you can leverage its capabilities wherever your workloads run\n\n### **Copilot support**\n\nWith Copilot, you can instantly interact with your alerts in a natural way. Just ask questions like ‘Show me my critical alerts’ or ‘Which alerts need my attention?’ Copilot will surface a clear list of alerts for you. From there, simply click an alert to view its details and access the Investigate button -your gateway to the Azure Copilot observability agent. With one click, you can dive deeper, uncover potential root causes, and get actionable insights to resolve issues faster.\n\n### **Looking ahead**\n\nThe Azure Copilot observability agent is evolving toward a broader role in your observability strategy. While today it focuses on investigations, we have an exciting roadmap to make investigations even smarter and more actionable. Future releases will also expand into advanced scenarios, such as correlating issues and managing monitoring configurations without adding complexity.\n\nStart using the Azure Copilot observability agent today\n\nAvailable in preview, the Azure Copilot observability agent is integrated into your existing Azure workflows. Access it from alerts, the Azure portal, or [Azure Copilot (gated preview)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/aka.ms/Ignite25/AzureCopilotBlog) and experience a smarter way to resolve issues.\n\n**Learn more:** [documentation](https://aka.ms/investigationmanuals) for full details on capabilities and setup.\n\nWe’re committed to evolving the observability agent based on your feedback.
