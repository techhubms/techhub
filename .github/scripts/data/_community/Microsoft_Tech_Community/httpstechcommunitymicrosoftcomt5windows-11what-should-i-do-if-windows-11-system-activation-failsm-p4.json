  "Description": "I recently installed a computer but never activated the system. I installed Windows 11 Home Edition. Today, on a whim, I found a code online to activate it, but after activation, I discovered that it was the Enterprise Edition. I have now uninstalled the key and everything else, but the system information still shows Enterprise Edition. Can I restore the system to Home Edition by installing the Home Edition key?",
