  "Description": "Hi Team,\n\nI want to build a use case to pull the Azure PAAS resources metrics using azure DCR and push that data metrics to log analytics workspace which eventually will push the data to azure event hub through streaming and final destination as azure postgres to store all the resources metrics information in a centralized table and create KPIs and dashboard for the clients for better utilization of resources. I have not used diagnose setting enabling option since it has its cons like we need to manually enable each resources settings also we get limited information extracted from diagnose setting. But while implementing i saw multiple articles stating DCR is not used for pulling PAAS metrics its only compatible for VM metrics. Want to understand is it possible to use DCR for PAAS metrics?\n\nThanks in advance for any inputs.",
