  "Description": "Azure Virtual Desktop continues to evolve with features that simplify deployment and management of session host for our customers. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of [Ephemeral OS disk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks) support the latest milestone in our [Enhanced Host Pool Management](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurevirtualdesktopblog/enhanced-host-pool-management-for-azure-virtual-desktop/430277) initiative introduced at Ignite. Designed for stateless workloads, Ephemeral OS disk stores the operating system on the virtual machine’s local storage, rather than remote storage. This enables a faster session host creation experience and improved performance, while maintaining consistent and responsive user experience.\n\n## Key benefits\n\nKey features of Ephemeral OS disk include:\n\n- **Faster provisioning and reimaging:** Session hosts can be created or reset in seconds.\n\n- **Improved Performance:** Read/write operations occur locally, improving performance.\n\n- **Optimized for Stateless Workloads:** Ideal for environments that want to avoid session hosts retaining state between uses.\n\n- **Broad availability:** Supported across all Azure regions and VM sizes with sufficient local disk capacity.\n\n## What is Ephemeral OS disk?\n\nEphemeral OS disks store the operating system on the virtual machine’s local storage instead of remote Azure Storage. This eliminates network latency and enables significantly faster disk operations. Because these disks are non-persistent, they’re ideal for stateless workloads where speed, scalability, and rapid reimaging are more important than long-term data retention.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo use ephemeral OS disks, a pooled host pool with [session host configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/add-session-hosts-host-pool?tabs=portal%2Cgui&pivots=host-pool-session-host-configuration) enabled is required. Ephemeral OS disks are not available for personal host pools or for host pools without session host configuration.\n\nYou can configure session host with ephemeral OS disk for your pooled host pools using Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, ARM, SDKs, and APIs.\n\n![]()\n\nTo configure a session host with an Ephemeral OS disk\n\n1. From the Azure Portal, on the Azure Virtual Desktop blade create a new pooled host pool and configured with Session host configuration.\n2. On the session host tab:\n\n- Select an image of your choice.\n- Select a VM size with sufficient local disk (cache or temp) to support your OS image.\n- Check the Ephemeral OS disk box.\n- Select the disk placement:\n\n- OS cache\n- Temp disk\n3. Complete the remaining fields to create your host pool and session host.\n\n## Using Dynamic Autoscaling plans with Ephemeral OS Disks\n\nEphemeral OS disks are designed for stateless workloads and don’t support traditional start or deallocate operations. To ensure reliable scaling and lifecycle management, we recommend using Dynamic Autoscaling plans when deploying session hosts with ephemeral OS disks.\n\nWith this setup, session hosts are created and deleted according to the rules defined in your scaling plan, ensuring efficient resource use while aligning with the stateless design of ephemeral OS disks.\n\nLearn more about [Dynamic Autoscaling plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/autoscale-create-assign-scaling-plan?tabs=portal%2Cintune&pivots=dynamic).\n\n## Next steps\n\nWe’re excited for you to begin exploring Ephemeral OS disks on Azure Virtual Desktop. We encourage you to check out our documents that include setup guidance, prerequisites, and much more to help you get started.\n\nStay up to date!
