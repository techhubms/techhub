  "Description": "When you start using Microsoft Azure, one of the first things you’ll come across is the concept of a **Service Level Agreement**, or **SLA**. It sounds straightforward — a promise of reliability from Microsoft — but the details can be confusing. You’ll see numbers like **99.9%**, **99.95%**, or even **99.99% uptime**, and it’s easy to assume they all mean near-perfect reliability.\n\nBut what does “99.9%” actually mean in real-world terms? How much downtime does it allow? And how should you plan your architecture to meet or even exceed those targets? Let’s break it down in plain English.\n\n[https://dellenny.com/understanding-azure-slas-what-99-9-really-means/](https://dellenny.com/understanding-azure-slas-what-99-9-really-means/)",
