  "Description": "Agents have exploded in popularity over the last year, reshaping not only the kinds of applications developers build but also the underlying architectures required to run them. As agentic applications grow more complex by invoking tools, collaborating with other services, and orchestrating multi-step workflows, architectures are naturally shifting toward microservice patterns. [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview) is purpose-built for this world: a fully managed, serverless platform designed to run independent, composable services with autoscaling, pay-per-second pricing, and seamless app-to-app communication.\n\nBy combining Azure Container Apps with the [Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview) and [Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry), developers can run containerized agents on ACA while using Foundry to visualize and monitor how those agents behave. Azure Container Apps handles scalable, high-performance execution of agent logic, and Microsoft Foundry lights up rich observability for reasoning, planning, tool calls, and errors through its integrated monitoring experience. Together, they form a powerful foundation for building and operating modern, production-grade agentic applications.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll walk through how to build an agent running on Azure Container Apps using Microsoft Agent Framework and OpenTelemetry, and then connect its telemetry to Microsoft Foundry so you can see your ACA-hosted agent directly in the Foundry monitoring experience.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- An Azure account with an active subscription.\n- If you don't have one, you [can create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).\n- Ensure you have a Microsoft Foundry project setup. If you don’t already have one, you can create a project from the[Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/projects).\n- [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) installed\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed\n\n## The Sample Agent\n\nThe complete[sample code is available in this repo](https://github.com/cachai2/foundry-3p-agents-samples) and can be deployed end-to-end with a single command. It's a basic currency agent. This sample deploys:\n\n- An **Azure Container Apps** environment\n- An agent built with **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)**\n- **OpenTelemetry instrumentation** using the Azure Monitor exporter\n- **Application Insights** to collect agent telemetry\n- A **Microsoft Foundry** resource\n- Environment wiring to integrate the agent with **Microsoft** **Foundry**\n\n## Deployment Steps\n\n1. **Clone the repository:**\n2. git clone https://github.com/cachai2/foundry-3p-agents-samples.git\ncd foundry-3p-agents-samples/azure\n3. **Authenticate with Azure:**\n4. azd auth login\n5. **Set the following azd environment variable**\n6. azd env set AZURE\\_AI\\_MODEL\\_DEPLOYMENT\\_NAME gpt-4.1-mini\n7. **Deploy to Azure**\n8. azd up\n\nThis provisions your Azure Container App, Application Insights, logs pipeline and required environment variables. While deployment runs, let’s break down how the code becomes compatible with Microsoft Foundry.\n\n## 1. Setting up the agent in Azure Container Apps\n\nTo integrate with Microsoft Foundry, the agent needs two essential capabilities:\n\n1. **Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF):** Handles agent logic, tools, schema-driven execution, and emits standardized gen\\_ai.\\* spans.\n2. **OpenTelemetry:** Sends the required agent/model/tool spans to Application Insights, which Microsoft Foundry consumes for visualization and monitoring.\n\nAlthough this sample uses MAF, the same pattern works with any agent framework. MAF and LangChain currently provide the richest telemetry support out-of-the-box.\n\n### 1.1 Configure Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)\n\nThe agent includes:\n\n- A **tool** (*get\\_exchange\\_rate*)\n- An **agent** created by *ChatAgent*\n- A **runtime manager** (*AgentRuntime*)\n- A **FastAPI app** exposing */invoke*\n\nTelemetry is enabled using two components already present in the repo:\n\n- **configure\\_azure\\_monitor:** Configures OpenTelemetry + Azure Monitor exporter + auto-instrumentation.\n- **setup\\_observability():** Enables MAF’s additional spans *(gen\\_ai.\\**, tool spans, agent lifecycle spans).\n\nFrom the repo (*\\_configure\\_observability()*):\n\n- from azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure\\_azure\\_monitor\nfrom agent\\_framework.observability import setup\\_observability from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource\n\ndef \\_configure\\_observability() -> None: configure\\_azure\\_monitor( resource=Resource.create({\"service.name\": SERVICE\\_NAME}), connection\\_string=APPLICATION\\_INSIGHTS\\_CONNECTION\\_STRING, )\n\nsetup\\_observability(enable\\_sensitive\\_data=False)\n\nThis gives you:\n\n- gen\\_ai.model.\\* spans (model usage + token counts)\n- tool call spans\n- agent lifecycle & execution spans\n- HTTP + FastAPI instrumentation\n- Standardized telemetry required by Microsoft Foundry\n\nNo manual TracerProvider wiring or OTLP exporter setup is needed.\n\n### 1.2 OpenTelemetry Setup (Azure Monitor Exporter)\n\nIn this sample, OpenTelemetry is fully configured by Azure Monitor’s helper:\n- import os\nfrom azure.monitor.opentelemetry import configure\\_azure\\_monitor from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource from agent\\_framework.observability import setup\\_observability\n\nSERVICE\\_NAME = os.getenv(\"ACA\\_SERVICE\\_NAME\", \"aca-currency-exchange-agent\")\n\nconfigure\\_azure\\_monitor( resource=Resource.create({\"service.name\": SERVICE\\_NAME}), connection\\_string=os.getenv(\"APPLICATION\\_INSIGHTS\\_CONNECTION\\_STRING\"), )\n\n# Enable Microsoft Agent Framework gen\\_ai/tool spans on top of OTEL\nsetup\\_observability(enable\\_sensitive\\_data=False)\n\nThis automatically:\n\n- Installs and configures the OTEL tracer provider\n- Enables batching + exporting of spans\n- Adds HTTP/FastAPI/Requests auto-instrumentation\n- Sends telemetry to Application Insights\n- Adds MAF’s agent + tool spans\n\nAll required environment variables (such as APPLICATION\\_INSIGHTS\\_CONNECTION\\_STRING) are injected automatically by azd up.\n\n## 2. Deploy the Model and Test Your Agent\n\nOnce *azd up* completes, you're ready to deploy a model to the Microsoft Foundry instance and test it.\n\n1. Find the resource name of your deployed Azure AI Services from azd up and navigate to it.\n2. From there, open it in [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/), navigate to the **Model Catalog** and add the **gpt-4.1-mini** model.\n3. Find the resource name of your deployed Azure Container App and navigate to it. Copy the application URL\n4. Set your container app URL environment variable in your terminal. (The below commands are for WSL.)\n5. export APP\\_URL=\"Your container app URL\"\n6. Now, go back to your terminal and run the following curl command to invoke the agent\n7. curl -X POST \"$APP\\_URL/invoke\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d '{ \"prompt\": \"How do I convert 100 USD to EUR?\" }'\n\n## 3. Verifying Telemetry to Application Insights\n\nOnce your Container App starts, you can validate telemetry:\n\n1. Open the **Application Insights** resource created by *azd up*\n2. Go to **Logs**\n3. Run these queries (make sure you're in KQL mode not simple mode)\n**Check MAF-genAI spans:**\n4. dependencies\n| where timestamp > ago(3h) | extend genOp = tostring(customDimensions[\"gen\\_ai.operation.name\"]), genSys = tostring(customDimensions[\"gen\\_ai.system\"]), reqModel = tostring(customDimensions[\"gen\\_ai.request.model\"]), resModel = tostring(customDimensions[\"gen\\_ai.response.model\"]) | summarize count() by genOp, genSys, reqModel, resModel | order by count\\_ desc\n\n**Check agent + tools:**\n5. dependencies\n| where timestamp > ago(1h) | extend genOp = tostring(customDimensions[\"gen\\_ai.operation.name\"]), agent = tostring(customDimensions[\"gen\\_ai.agent.name\"]), tool = tostring(customDimensions[\"gen\\_ai.tool.name\"]) | where genOp in (\"agent.run\", \"invoke\\_agent\", \"execute\\_tool\") | project timestamp, genOp, agent, tool, name, target, customDimensions | order by timestamp desc\n\nIf telemetry is flowing, you’re ready to plug your agent into Microsoft Foundry.\n\n## 4. Connect Application Insights to Microsoft Foundry\n\nMicrosoft Foundry uses your Application Insights resource to power:\n\n- Agent monitoring\n- Tool call traces\n- Reasoning graphs\n- Multi-agent orchestration views\n- Error analysis\n\nTo connect:\n\n1. Navigate to **Monitoring** in the left navigation pane of the Microsoft Foundry portal.\n2. Select the **Application analytics** tab.\n3. Select your application insights resource created from azd up\n4. Connect the resource to your AI Foundry project.\n\nNote: If you are unable to add your application insights connection this way, you may need to follow the following: Navigate to the **Overview** of your Foundry project -> **Open in management center -> Connected resources -> New Connection -> Application Insights**\n\nFoundry will automatically start ingesting:\n\n- *gen\\_ai.\\** spans\n- tool spans\n- agent lifecycle spans\n- workflow traces\n\nNo additional configuration is required.\n\n## 5. Viewing Dashboards & Traces in Microsoft Foundry\n\nOnce your Application Insights connection is added, you can view your agent’s telemetry directly in [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com)’s Monitoring experience.\n\n### 5.1 Monitoring\n\nThe **Monitoring** tab shows high-level operational metrics for your application, including:\n\n- **Total inference calls**\n- **Average call duration**\n- **Overall success/error rate**\n- **Token usage** (when available)\n- **Traffic trends over time**\n\nThis view is useful for spotting **latency spikes**, **increased load**, or **changes in usage patterns,** and these visualizations are powered by the telemetry emitting from your agents in Azure Container Apps.\n\n![]()\n\n### 5.2 Traces Timeline\n\nThe **Tracing** tab shows the full distributed trace of each agent request, including all spans emitted by Microsoft Foundry and your Azure Container App with Microsoft Agent Framework. You can see:\n\n- **Top-level operations** such as invoke\\_agent, chat, and process\\_thread\\_run\n- **Tool calls** like execute\\_tool\\_get\\_exchange\\_rate\n- **Internal MAF steps** (create\\_thread, create\\_message, run tool)\n- **Azure credential calls** (GET /msi/token)\n- **Input/output tokens and duration** for each span\n\nThis view gives you an end-to-end breakdown of how your agent executed, which tools it invoked, and how long each step took — essential for debugging and performance tuning.\n\n![]()\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy combining Azure Container Apps, the Microsoft Agent Framework, and OpenTelemetry, you can build agents that are not only scalable and production-ready, but also fully observable and orchestratable inside Microsoft Foundry. Container Apps provides the execution engine and autoscaling foundation, MAF supplies structured agent logic and telemetry, and Microsoft Foundry ties everything together with powerful planning, monitoring, and workflow visualization.\n\nThis architecture gives you the best of both worlds: the flexibility of running your own containerized agents with the dependencies you choose, and the intelligence of Microsoft Foundry to coordinate multi-step reasoning, tool call, and cross-agent workflows.\n\nAs the agent ecosystem continues to evolve, Azure Container Apps and Microsoft Foundry provide a strong, extensible foundation for building the next generation of intelligent, microservice-driven applications.",
