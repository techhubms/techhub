  "Description": "***Ehsan Nasr**, Director, Energy Technology, Microsoft*\n\nWhat if the density of IT equipment surged dramatically due to AI acceleration? Would our existing power conversion and distribution systems be enough to support the next generation of GPU racks?\n\nAs AI workloads push data centers to deploy increasingly GPU clusters, the traditional electrical architecture built around AC legacy transformers faces a critical inflection point. If GPU racks begin operating at higher voltages to meet performance demands, can today’s infrastructure keep up? Or do we need to rethink the entire system architecture from how we distribute power, to how we protect it, to how we convert it?\n\nWe believe the answer lies in a full-stack transformation of the data center power system. This includes reimagining the electrical topology, developing new classes of equipment, and exploring advanced conversion and distribution technologies.

SSTs represent a new approach to power conversion, using frequencies in the tens to hundreds of kHz rather than 50/60 Hz. These transformers convert medium-voltage AC power (&lt;35 KV) to DC voltages (&lt;1500 VDC), which can be provided directly to IT racks, simplifying and reducing the size of the power system.
