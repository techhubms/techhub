  "Description": "Enterprises have long relied on Oracle Databases to run mission-critical workloads across finance, HR, supply chain, manufacturing and many other sectors. Now, with [Oracle Database@Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/database-overview), they can modernize these workloads directly within the Microsoft Cloud combining Oracle’s proven reliability and performance with Azure’s scalability, security, and AI-driven innovation.\n\nThe next phase of this evolution brings AI copilots closer to enterprise data. With Microsoft [Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio), organizations can now easily build custom copilots that securely connect to live Oracle data, providing natural language access to insights and actions within Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365, or any business application.\n\n**From Data Modernization to AI Innovation**\n\nOracle Database@Azure provides customers the flexibility to run Oracle workloads on Azure using Exadata, Autonomous, Exascale, or Base Database services without compromising performance or compliance. Once this data foundation is established, Copilot Studio becomes the bridge that turns structured Oracle data into conversational, intelligent experiences.\n\nWithin minutes, organizations can design copilots that interpret business questions, query live Oracle data, and return contextual insights. No dashboards, no manual queries or no waiting for weekly and monthly reports, just trusted intelligence from the source of truth.\n\nThis integration transforms how employees interact with enterprise systems, shifting from static reporting to dynamic, AI-driven dialogue in real time.\n\n**Enterprise-Grade Security, Built In**\n\nSecurity and compliance are at the core of every copilot built in Copilot Studio. Each copilot automatically inherits Microsoft’s trusted governance framework:\n\n- Microsoft Entra ID ensures identity protection through Multi Factor Authentication, conditional access, and centralized authentication.\n\n- Microsoft Purview extends data governance with sensitivity labels, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, and audit trails even for AI conversations.\n\n- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enables granular control over who can create, modify, or publish copilots, aligning with enterprise compliance policies.\n\n- Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel further strengthen this ecosystem by monitoring Oracle Database@Azure environments for threats, vulnerabilities, and anomalous behavior, enabling proactive detection and response.\n\nThese layers ensure copilots that access Oracle Database@Azure or hybrid Oracle environments remain secure, governed, and compliant by design critical for regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and telecommunications.\n\n**How to Get Started**\n\nCreating an Oracle data powered copilot in Copilot Studio is simple and fast:\n\n1. Create a new copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio by selecting the “**New Agent**” option.\n\n![]()\n\n2. Connect your **Oracle Database** as a **knowledge** **source** through a secure connection: Add knowledge → Oracle Database.\n\n![]()\n\n![]()\n\nAfter the connection is established, the available tables within the schema will appear for selection. Once you select the desired tables, the copilot becomes grounded with relevant data from your Oracle Database.\n\n![]()\n\n3. Define topics and natural-language prompts that map to live queries.\n\n4. Apply Purview labels and Entra ID access policies to enforce governance.\n\n5. Publish directly into Microsoft Teams or Microsoft 365 for business-user access and collaboration.\n\nThis workflow allows teams to move from structured data to governed conversational intelligence all within Microsoft’s AI-native ecosystem.\n\n**Example: Sales Insights Copilot**\n\nA finance department using Oracle Database@Azure can rapidly build a Sales Insights Copilot to simplify performance tracking and decision-making.\n\n![]()\n\nWhen a leader asks:\n\n“**What are the top five regions driving profit growth this quarter?**”\n\nThe copilot connects securely to **Oracle** data using the connector, executes the query, and delivers the answer instantly either in Microsoft Teams or M365 or any other supported channels. It respects existing data-governance controls and never exposes sensitive information. The result is faster decision-making and greater agility without the overhead of new dashboards or manual analysis.\n\n![]()\n\n**Why It Matters**\n\nTogether, Oracle Database@Azure and Microsoft Copilot Studio enable organizations to go beyond modernization to innovation. They empower enterprises to:\n\n- Run Oracle workloads on Azure with low latency and enterprise-grade performance.\n\n- Build AI copilots that bring Oracle data to life through conversational access.\n\n- Maintain security, privacy, and compliance through Purview, Entra ID, and RBAC.\n\nBy uniting trusted Oracle data with Microsoft’s AI-native tools, enterprises can reimagine how data is consumed turning it into actionable, intelligent copilots that operate securely at scale.\n\n**Get Started Today**\n\nNow is the time to modernize your Oracle environments with Oracle Database@Azure, delivering greater agility, AI-driven insights, and enterprise-grade security.\n\nClick [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/) to get started today and connect with your local Microsoft sales team.\n\nWe encourage you to try out these new features and let us know what you think:\n\n- Learn everything about [Oracle Database@Azure](https://aka.ms/oracle)\n\n- Connect to [Oracle Database in Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/oracle/)\n\nFollow our [LinkedIn community](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14707004/) for the latest updates, feature highlights, and best practices on building AI copilots with Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI foundry and Oracle Database@Azure.",
