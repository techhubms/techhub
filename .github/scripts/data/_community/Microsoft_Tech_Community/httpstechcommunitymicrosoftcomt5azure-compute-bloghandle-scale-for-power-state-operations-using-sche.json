Scheduled Actions ensures maximum operational throughput for your subscription on large-scale concurrent requests. Operations that fail due to intermittent or transient errors are automatically retried.\n\nYou can use batch calls of up to 100 VMs at a time to submit up to 5000 VMs for a single action. Scheduled Actions will generate an operation ID for each VM which can be used for checking the status of those operations. Actions can be executed immediately or can be submitted to trigger at a specified time. Actions scheduled at a future time can be cancelled.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGet started at the [Scheduled Actions docs here](https://aka.ms/ScheduledActionsDocs)\n\nUpdated Nov 14, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[!\\[TravisCragg_MSFT&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-1.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/traviscragg_msft/2448651) [TravisCragg_MSFT](/users/traviscragg_msft/2448651) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined April 30, 2024\n\n[View Profile](/users/traviscragg_msft/2448651)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurecompute [Azure Compute Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurecompute) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
