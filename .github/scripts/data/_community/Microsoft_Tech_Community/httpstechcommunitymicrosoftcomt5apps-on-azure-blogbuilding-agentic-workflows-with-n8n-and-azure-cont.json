  "EnhancedContent": "## We had to create a Github triage agent and found n8n. It's a awesome no-code method to automate pretty much everything.\n\nWhen it comes to connecting systems and automating tasks, **[n8n](https://n8n.io/)** has built a passionate community around a powerful, extensible workflow engine. With hundreds of integrations and the ability to share workflows across a vibrant user base, n8n is quickly becoming the go-to choice for teams who want to orchestrate data, APIs, and AI.\n\nOn Azure, combining n8n with **Azure OpenAI Service** and **Azure Container Apps (ACA)** makes it easier than ever to run intelligent automations at any scale. Whether you’re experimenting with ideas, building small team solutions, or deploying resilient production systems, Azure provides the right infrastructure options.\n\n## Why n8n on Azure?\n\n- **Community workflows**: Start quickly with pre-built automation templates and shared flows from the n8n community.\n- **AI built-in**: Seamlessly add natural language, summarization, and reasoning with **Azure Foundry’s OpenAI models**.\n- **Managed scale**: Use **Azure Container Apps** to deploy n8n in a fully managed, container-native environment with scaling, networking, and security built in.\n- **Flexibility**: Choose from lightweight testing to production-grade environments with the same deployment template.\n\n## Three ways to deploy n8n with Azure Container Apps\n\nWe’ve created an **Azure deployment template** that supports three common scenarios. You can move between them as your needs evolve.\n\n- **Try:** Spin up n8n in minutes. Great for testing integrations with Azure OpenAI before committing to infrastructure.\n- **Small:** Bring persistence and private networking. Designed for small teams who want to keep their workflows and data across sessions.\n- **Production:** Scale securely and reliably. Suitable for production deployments where resilience, security, and multi-instance scaling are key.\n\n## Bringing AI into the Flow\n\nOnce n8n is running, you can plug in **Azure OpenAI models** directly into workflows—powering:\n\n- Automated content generation\n- Intelligent routing and decision logic\n- Summarization of long-form data\n- Enhanced customer engagement scenarios\n\nBy pairing n8n’s integrations with Azure OpenAI’s reasoning and text generation, you unlock entirely new categories of automation.\n\n## Get Started Today\n\nYou can find [the template and detailed instructions here](https://github.com/simonjj/n8n-on-aca).\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nn8n brings a thriving automation ecosystem; Azure provides the enterprise-grade foundation. Together, they empower developers and business teams to create intelligent, scalable automations—from quick experiments to mission-critical production workflows.\n\nPublished Sep 09, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure container apps](/tag/azure%20container%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[simonjj&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xODQxMzYxLTQ3MjUxOWk1Nzk1MTRDNDI4OEUxRkZD?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/simonjj/1841361) [simonjj](/users/simonjj/1841361) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined April 26, 2023\n\n[View Profile](/users/simonjj/1841361)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
