  "EnhancedContent": "## Today, we are excited to announce the general availability of Azure API Management Premium v2 tier.\n\nSuperior capacity, highest entity limits, unlimited included calls, and the most comprehensive set of features set the Premium v2 tier apart from other API Management tiers. Customers rely on the Premium v2 tier for running enterprise-wide API programs at scale, with high availability, and performance.\n\nThe Premium v2 tier has a new architecture that eliminates management traffic from the customer VNet, making private networking much more secure and easier to setup.  During the creation of a Premium v2 instance, you can choose between [VNet injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/virtual-network-concepts#virtual-network-injection) or [VNet integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/virtual-network-concepts#outbound-integration) (introduced in the Standard v2 tier) options.\n\nIn addition, today we are also adding three new features to Premium v2:\n\n1. **Inbound Private Link**: You can now enable private endpoint connectivity to restrict inbound access to your Premium v2 instance. It can be enabled along with VNet injection or VNet integration or without a VNet.\n2. **Availability zone support**: Premium v2 now supports availability zones (zone redundancy) to enhance the reliability and resilience of your API gateway.\n3. **Custom CA certificates**: Azure API management v2 gateway can now validate TLS connections with the backend service using custom CA certificates.\n\n### New and improved VNet injection\n\nUsing VNet injection in Premium v2 no longer requires configuring routes or service endpoints. Customers can secure their API workloads without impacting API Management dependencies, while Microsoft can secure the infrastructure without interfering with customer API workloads. In short, the new VNet injection implementation enables both parties to manage network security and configuration settings independently and without affecting each other.\n\nYou can now configure your APIs with complete networking flexibility: force tunnel all outbound traffic to on-premises, send all outbound traffic through an NVA, or add a WAF device to monitor all inbound traffic to your API Management Premium v2—all without constraints.\n\n*VNet-injected API Management instance. Users are free to manage inbound and outbound access and routing.*\n\n### Inbound Private Link\n\nCustomers can now configure an inbound private endpoint for their API Management Premium v2 instance to allow your API consumers securely access the API Management gateway over Azure Private Link.\n\nThe private endpoint uses an IP address from an Azure virtual network in which it's hosted. Network traffic between a client on your private network and API Management traverses over the virtual network and a Private Link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet. Further, you can configure custom DNS settings or an Azure DNS private zone to map the API Management hostname to the endpoint's private IP address.\n\nWith a private endpoint and Private Link, you can:\n\n- Create multiple Private Link connections to an API Management instance.\n- Use the private endpoint to send inbound traffic on a secure connection.\n- Apply different API Management policies based on whether traffic comes from the private endpoint.\n- Limit incoming traffic only to private endpoints, preventing data exfiltration.\n- Combine with inbound virtual network injection or outbound virtual network integration to provide end-to-end network isolation of your API Management clients and backend services.\n\nMore details can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/private-endpoint?tabs=premv2)\n\n*VNet-integrated API Management instance. Users can disable inbound public access.*\n\nToday, only the API Management instance’s Gateway endpoint supports inbound private link connections. Each API management instance can support at most 100 Private Link connections.\n\n### Availability zones\n\nAzure API Management Premium v2 now supports Availability Zones (AZ) redundancy to enhance the reliability and resilience of your API gateway. When deploying an API Management instance in an AZ-enabled region, users can choose to enable zone redundancy. This distributes the service's units, including Gateway, management plane, and developer portal, across multiple, physically separate AZs within that region. Learn how to enable AZs [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/enable-availability-zone-support?tabs=premv2)\n\n*Select \"Enable zone redundancy\" flag to enable availability zone support*\n\n### CA certificates\n\nIf the API Management Gateway needs to connect to the backends secured with TLS certificates issued by private certificate authorities (CA), you need to configure custom CA certificates in the API Management instance. Custom CA certificates can be added and managed as Authorization Credentials in the Backend entities.\n\nThe Backend entity has been extended with new properties allowing customers to specify a list of certificate thumbprints or subject name + issuer thumbprint pairs that Gateway should trust when establishing TLS connection with associated backend endpoint.\n\nMore details can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/backends?tabs=portal#configure-ca-certificate).\n\n*Provide certificate thumbprint or subject name and issuer thumbprint for the backend*\n\n### Region availability\n\nThe Premium v2 tier is now generally available in six public regions (**Australia East, East US2, Germany West Central, Korea Central, Norway East and UK South**) with additional regions coming soon.\n\nFor pricing information and regional availability, please visit the API Management [pricing page](https://aka.ms/apimpricing).\n\n### Learn more\n\n- [API Management v2 tiers FAQ](https://aka.ms/apim/skuv2/faq)\n- [API Management v2 tiers documentation](https://aka.ms/apimdocs/skuv2/overview)\n- [API Management overview documentation](https://aka.ms/acom-faq-whatisapim)\n\nUpdated Nov 19, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[api management](/tag/api%20management?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[azure](/tag/azure?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[enterprise integration](/tag/enterprise%20integration?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[integration](/tag/integration?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[msignite](/tag/msignite?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[openai](/tag/openai?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[Sreekanth_Thirthala&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-5.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/sreekanth_thirthala/154962) [Sreekanth_Thirthala](/users/sreekanth_thirthala/154962) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined June 11, 2018\n\n[View Profile](/users/sreekanth_thirthala/154962)\n\n/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog [Azure Integration Services Blog](/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
