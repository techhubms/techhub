From prompts to create test data, to automated creation of maps, unit test or custom code and anything in between. Maybe you have been using prompts, instructions or chat modes to make your development life easier? We want to see it all!\n\n#### Call for papers\n\n- Within the themes above we are looking for breakout sessions (around 28 minutes in lenght) or lightning sessions (around 12 minutes in length).\n- The call for papers are open until September 7, 2025 - 11:00 PM (PST).\n- Selected sessions and speakers will be informed by email by September 10, 2025.\n\nClick on the image below to submit your session to Logic Apps Community Day 2025!
