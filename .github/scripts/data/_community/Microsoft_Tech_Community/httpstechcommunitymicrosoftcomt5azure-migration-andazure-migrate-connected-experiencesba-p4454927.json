It enables businesses to stay competitive by aligning their capabilities with evolving customer and market demands. Modernization is not a one-time event with a finish-line but a continuous journey of evolution. As technology, customer expectations, and competitive landscapes shift, so must the systems and processes that support them. Cloud-native architectures are inherently aligned with modernization while providing access to innovations such as AI. By treating modernization as an ongoing discipline, organizations can stay ahead of disruption, adapt faster to change, and unlock new opportunities. This ability to move faster and smarter is fully realized in Azure — where modernization becomes both a technical upgrade and a strategic advantage. It enables organizations to refocus on core priorities, respond to market shifts in real time, and reduce operational costs.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is Azure Migrate — Microsoft’s free, unified platform for cloud migration and modernization. It offers comprehensive capabilities including IT resource discovery, assessment, business case analysis, planning, and execution — all in a workload-agnostic manner. From a single, secure portal, users can manage and monitor the entire journey and cut over to production in Azure with confidence.\n\nToday, we’re excited to introduce several impactful Azure Migrate features designed to help you move your on-premises workloads to Azure more efficiently:\n\n**Accelerated migration and modernization to the cloud.**\n\nAzure Migrate **Agentic method** offers an intuitive and insightful approach to cloud transformation. AI assistance assesses on-prem environments, identifies dependencies, and orchestrates workload transitions with minimal manual intervention. By continuously adapting and delegating activities to the appropriate persona, the agents streamline complex migration paths, reduce risk, and accelerate time-to-value. For organizations moving to Azure, the agentic method provides a fast, frictionless route, turning what was once a daunting task into a guided, efficient journey toward modernization. Learn more about our approach in [this video](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/shivashastri/EUmUolWmHUlBhHgrgUgiUbQBRVEzxQ7XRsgk_jRXBH3AYw?e=bXjNrG).\n\n**Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) plays a pivotal role in cloud migration and modernization by enabling organizations to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure through code. This approach ensures consistency, scalability, and repeatability across environments, reducing manual errors and accelerating deployment timelines. Azure Migrate now supports IaC, thus simplifying the transition from legacy systems to cloud-native architectures by codifying infrastructure configurations, making it easier to replicate and validate setups.\n\n**** **Comprehensive coverage and consistent user experience for your IT estate.**\n\nNo single migration or modernization tool can address the full spectrum of enterprise scenarios and technologies. That’s why Azure Migrate takes a platform-centric approach — delivering a unified, intelligent experience that spans the entire IT estate. By seamlessly interoperating with specialized tools like **Database Migration Service** (DMS) and **GitHub Copilot** (GHCP), Azure Migrate empowers organizations to modernize with confidence, flexibility, and speed. Advanced capabilities like 6R analysis — Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild, Replace, and Retire — empower organizations to tailor modernization strategies to each application, driving smarter, scenario-specific decisions. Support for migration of **Arc-enabled** resources extends Azure Migrate’s management and governance capabilities to hybrid and multi-cloud environments, ensuring consistency and control regardless of where workloads reside. Additionally, support for **Rocky Linux**, **PostgreSQL**, and **application awareness** empowers teams to assess entire open-source application stacks with dependencies for readiness to migrate to Azure.\n\n**Secure by design with human in-the-loop.**\n\nAzure Migrate has recently introduced several security enhancements that reinforce Microsoft's commitment to a \"secure by design\" and \"secure by default\" approach. Among the key updates is the **friction-free collector**, which simplifies secure data collection for migration assessments while minimizing exposure risks. The friction-free discovery in Azure Migrate eliminates the need for deploying discovery appliances for initial assessments. As a result, it accelerates time-to-value, reduces setup complexity, and aligns well with security-conscious environments, making it an efficient and low-risk way to begin cloud migration planning.\n\nAzure Migrate supports Private Link and disabling public network access, ensuring that migration traffic remains within secure, private channels. Additionally, the platform enforces data encryption both in transit and at rest, with options for customer-managed keys, and integrates tightly with Azure Key Vault for secure credential and secret management.\n\nA security vulnerability report during migration and modernization identifies misconfigurations, outdated components, or exposed services, and the report provides actionable insights that align with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) threat protection and posture management capabilities. This allows teams to proactively remediate risks and apply MDC’s security controls ensuring the environment is secure from day-1 in Azure.\n\nAs organizations navigate shifting markets, supply chains, and climate challenges, **sustainability** has become a strategic imperative. Azure’s carbon optimization capabilities provide clear visibility into potential emission reductions and cost savings, helping IT teams prioritize impactful actions. By unifying planning, execution, and continuity across infrastructure and applications, Azure delivers a consistent modernization experience. Ultimately, cloud-powered innovation enables businesses to drive efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and stay competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\n**** **Learn more**\n\nStart with a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?icid=azure-migrate) if you are new.
