Supported by expert guidance and investments through Azure Accelerate, every step is secure, resilient, and ready for the future of agentic applications.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nAccelerate your migration and modernization journey with Azure Essentials, Azure Migrate, and GitHub Copilot—empowering your organization to join the ranks of Frontier Firms: businesses that put AI and cloud innovation at the core of their strategy. Supported by expert guidance and investments through Azure Accelerate, every step is secure, resilient, and ready for the future of agentic applications.\n\n*Join the [Migrate and Modernize Summit,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events/launch-events/migrate-and-modernize-summit)where Microsoft will show new AI-assisted migration tools that will help teams modernize.*\n\n**Why Secure and Resilient Migration Matters More Than Ever**\n\nMigrating to Azure is more than a technical upgrade—it’s a strategic move that positions your organization to lead as a Frontier Firm, where AI and cloud innovation drive transformation. By prioritizing secure and resilient migration practices, businesses unlock new opportunities for collaboration between human teams and AI agents, strengthen customer trust, and lay the groundwork for breakthrough, data-driven innovation.\n\nToday, organizations are increasingly looking to migrate with AI—leveraging tools like [Azure Migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview?view=migrate-classic) and [GitHub Copilot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/github/copilot) to accelerate and simplify the process, while ensuring their cloud environment is secure, resilient, and ready for agentic applications.\n\nA resilient migration strategy ensures continuity of critical operations and enables rapid recovery from disruptions. This approach not only benefits IT teams, but also protects revenue, business continuity, and customer relationships—while opening the door to the next wave of AI-powered opportunities.\n\n**Secure Migration: The Foundation for AI Readiness**\n\nWith Azure, teams can accelerate discovery, code upgrades, and refactoring—an AI-assisted approach that compresses timelines and hardens security and governance enroute to [AI-ready landing zones](https://github.com/Azure/AI-Landing-Zones). By embedding security throughout the migration lifecycle, organizations lay the groundwork for trust, compliance, and data integrity—key prerequisites for deploying advanced AI workloads in the cloud.\n\nThis secure, well-governed environment protects sensitive data, ensures regulatory compliance, and supports the accuracy and effectiveness of AI models. Consequently, organizations can strategically experiment with, implement, and expand AI solutions, leverage predictive analytics, and foster breakthroughs that generate measurable business value.\n\n**Azure Essentials: Your Blueprint for Secure and Resilient Migration**\n\nAzure Essentials offers organizations a comprehensive blueprint for secure, resilient, and cost-effective migration to the cloud. Frontier Firms rely on these proven methodologies and tools to confidently modernize their infrastructure, drawing on best practices shaped by real-world customer experiences.\n\nA successful cloud migration unfolds in three key phases:\n\n1. Phase One: Establishing readiness and foundation\n2. Phase 2: Designing and deploying with governance\n3. Phase 3: Managing and optimizing deployments\n\nBy following the Azure Essentials framework, organizations can build a secure, well-governed foundation that supports agentic applications and positions them to scale AI innovation with confidence.\n\n**Phase One: Readiness and Foundation—Laying the Groundwork for Security and Resiliency**\n\nSecurity and resiliency start from the very first phase.
