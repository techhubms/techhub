  "Description": "The ability to share Capacity Reservation Groups (CRGs) with subscriptions is now in Public Preview.\n\nPreviously, customers could deploy VMs in a Capacity Reservation Group within the same subscription only. On-demand Capacity Reservation Group (CRG) can now be shared with other subscriptions. Using this option can make it easier to manage some common configuration needs like resource reuse, centralized capacity management, more cost-effective scale-out and separating security and capacity concerns.\n\nFor example, for resource reuse scenario, customers cannot use a Disaster Recovery Capacity Reservation Group for development testing purposes across subscriptions today. With the sharing feature, customers will be able to repurpose the Capacity Reservation Group for non-production workloads.\n\n![]()\n\n**User Experience:**\n\nSharing reserved capacity requires at least two subscriptions:\n\n1. Provider subscription – the subscription that creates and hosts the Capacity Reservation Group and member Capacity Reservations.\n2. Consumer subscription - another subscription that is granted access to the reserved capacity, obtaining the ability to deploy virtual machines (VMs) with the Capacity Reservation Service Level Agreement (SLA).\n\nThe deployed VMs must match one of the Capacity Reservations in the Capacity Reservation groups on SKU, location, and availability zone if applicable.\n\nExample:\n\nIn this example, Subscription A is the Provider and Subscription B is the Consumer subscription.\n\n- Step 1: Share CRG X\n\n- A rights administrator in Subscription B must grant User “A” CRG “share” permissions.\n\n- User “A” (CRG owner) must then update the “sharing profile” of CRG X to include Subscription B. A given Capacity Reservation Group can be shared with up to 100 consumer subscriptions\n\n![]()\n\n- Step 2: grant user access to CRG X\n\n- A rights administrator in Subscription A must grant User “B” (VM owner) read and deploy rights to CRG X in Subscription A.\n\n- Once complete, User B can deploy VMs by setting the “capacityReservationGroup” property on Virtual Machines or Virtual Machine Scale Sets.\n\n![]()\n\n**Public Preview limitations:**\n\n- Portal support is not available; API and other Azure clients are available.\n\n- Re-provisioning of VMSS VMs using a shared Capacity Reservation Group is not supported during a zone outage.\n\nResources to get started: [https://aka.ms/computereservationsharing](https://aka.ms/computereservationsharing).\n\nAdditionally, you can read the [on demand capacity reservation documentation](https://aka.ms/on-demand-capacity-reservations-docs) that includes sample code.\n\nBackground:\n\nOn-demand capacity reservations for Azure Virtual Machines let you deploy and manage the compute capacity required to run Azure Virtual Machines. This new feature enables your IT organization to reserve compute capacity for a VM size. The reservation can be for any length of time in any public Azure region or availability zone and supports most VM series. You can create and cancel an on-demand capacity reservation at any time; no commitment is required.\n\nThe ability for you to access compute capacity–with SLA guarantees–ahead of actual VM deployments is particularly important to ensure the availability of business-critical applications running on Azure. On-demand capacity reservations can be combined with Azure Reserved VM Instances (RIs) to significantly reduce costs.\n\nRead the [blog](https://aka.ms/on-demand-capacity-reservations-GA-ACOM) (link to tech community blog for Public Preview of specialty SKUs) for more details.
