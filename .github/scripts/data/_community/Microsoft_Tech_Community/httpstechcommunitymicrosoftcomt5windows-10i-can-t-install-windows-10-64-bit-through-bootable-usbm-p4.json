  "Description": "![]() So, I'm trying to Install 64-bit Windows 10 but my laptop won't boot up from USB at all. My current Windows 10 is 32-bit, my proccesor is 64-bit. I have tried extracting an ISO file and then open the setup.exe from there and it just says this app can't run on yours pc. However if I try to open the 32-bit setup.exe it works just fine.\n\nThe issue with the bootable USB is, I go to the screen where it says \"Press any key to boot from USB\" I press any key and then it just restarts. I have set my BIOS boot to USB so it just keeps doing this thing over and over again until I change the boot order. I can't go past the \"Press any key to boot from USB\", yes the keyboard works since after I press any key, the screen just goes black and restarts. Can I get some help regarding this?",
