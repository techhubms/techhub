  "EnhancedContent": "## This article provides guidance for implementing Siemens SPDM-Simulation and Product Data Management Application on Azure- HPC Cluster\n\n# Introduction:\n\nMany customers run multiple Teamcenter-SPDM solutions across the enterprise, mixing multiple instances, multiple ISV vendors, and hybrid cloud/on-prem implementations. This fragmentation reduces the customer’s ability to uniformly access data. Consolidating Teamcenter-SPDM on Azure can speed the shift to one consistent, harmonized PLM experience, enterprise wide.\n\nWhat is Teamcenter Simulation?\n\nTeamcenter Simulation integrates simulation data, processes, and results **** into the broader PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) environment. Instead of engineers running simulations in silos on local drives, it provides:\n\n- A single source of truth for CAD, simulation models, inputs, and results.\n- Traceability across design, analysis, and manufacturing.\n- Support for multi-CAD, multi-CAE tools (e.g., NX Nastran, ANSYS, Abaqus, Star-CCM+).\n- Primary benefit Teamcenter Simulation SPDM gives you full traceability from source to solution. SPDM is a single source of truth where CAE analysis of a product design testing is related to a corresponding item in original CAD. This relationship of CAD and SIM data is a key to determine which CAD revision is captured in a particular CAE analysis.\n\n# Architecture:\n\nSiemens Teamcenter SPDM baseline architecture has two major blocks of architectures which are connected.\n\n1. Teamcenter PLM core deployment\n2. StarCCM deployed on HPC Cyclecloud Slurm Workspace\n\n1. Teamcenter PLM Core Deployment:\n\nIt has four distributed tiers (client, web, enterprise, and resource) in a single availability zone. Each tier aligns to function and communication flows between these tiers. All four tiers use their own virtual machines in a single virtual network. The Teamcenter Simulation aka CAE manage is core business functionality of SPDM runs on a central server in the enterprise tier and users access it through a web-based or thick-client interface. You can deploy multiple instances in Dev and Test environments by adding extra virtual machines and storage on virtual networks separate from production virtual networks.\n\n1. StarCCM HPC Cyclecloud slurm cluster architecture:\n\nSiemens StarCCM simulation software will be deployed on Azure Cyclecloud HPC Scheduler node. CAE Analyst fires the simulation jobs from Teamcenter Active workspace or Rich client UI. Azure HPC will then spin up and HPC nodes, these nodes will process the jobs submitted by CAE Analyst based on the runtime parameter. StarCCM will processed complete the simulation iteration and .sim file output will be generated.\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. CAE Analysts, SPDM & Teamcenter users access the Teamcenter application via an HTTPS-based endpoint Public URL. Users access the application through two user interfaces: (1) a Rich client and (2) an Active workspace client, CAE engineer/Simulation Analysts  access the Teamcenter through the Teamcenter Simulation client. Teamcenter Simulation client is lightweight thin client runs on users’ desktop.\n2. User access will be authenticated via Company’s Azure Entra ID. Azure Entra ID with SAML configuration allows single sign on(SSO) to the Teamcenter application.\n3. Azure Firewall & Azure backbone Security component which filter the traffic and threat intelligence feeds directly from Microsoft Cyber Security. Https traffic directed to the Azure Application gateway. The Hub virtual network and Spoke virtual network are peered so they can communicate over the Azure backbone network.\n4. Azure Application Gateway routes traffic to the Teamcenter’s web server virtual machines (VMs) in the Web tier.\n5. Siemens PLM Teamcenter deployment on Azure.\n\n- For detailed information about [Teamcenter Architecture on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/manufacturing/teamcenter-baseline)  refer this url.\n- Teamcenter Simulation Client runs on Teamcenter User’s desktop.\n- CAE manager is deployed as integral part of the Teamcenter package.\n\n1. Teamcenter Simulation on Azure HPC:\n\n- CAE Engineer executes the following typical workflow with Azure HPC cluster\n\n### Step 1: CAD Data & Product Structures\n\n- CAD models (e.g., from NX, CATIA, SolidWorks) are managed in Teamcenter.\n- Simulation engineer links simulation models directly to Teamcenter product structures.\n- Ensures simulation always uses the latest or correct version of the design.\n\n### Step 2: Build Simulation Model (Pre-processing)\n\n- Simulation templates define solver type (FEA, CFD, Multiphysics) and required inputs.\n- Engineers use tools like NX CAE, Simcenter 3D, ANSYS, Abaqus, or Star-CCM+ integrated with Teamcenter.\n- Meshes, boundary conditions, loads, and materials are associated with the correct design revision.\n\n### Step 3: Manage Simulation Data\n\n- All input decks, scripts, and models stored in Teamcenter for version control.\n- Metadata (e.g., load case, solver settings) captured for searchability & re-use.\n- Supports process automation: simulation workflows can be pre-configured for repeatable tasks.\n\n### Step 4: Run Simulation Jobs (Enhanced with Azure CycleCloud Benefits)\n\n- Jobs submitted to local HPC clusters or cloud HPC (Azure CycleCloud,) directly from Teamcenter.\n- Teamcenter stores solver logs, job status, and output files.\n- Following diagram show end to end workflow starts with Teamcenter CAE manager--&gt; StarCCM --&gt;HPC cluster -&gt;Simulation processing Sim file --&gt;Sim file back to Teamcenter\n- Teamcenter CAE manager--&gt; StarCCM running on HPC cluster\n\n- Teamcenter generates the job file on the HPC node\n\n- HPC Cluster creating HPC nodes\n\n- Squeue monitoring on HPC node\n\n- Job monitoring on Teamcenter UI\n\n- Simulation output file generated by Sbatch job\n\n- - - - - - File copied over to Teamcenter shared file location\n\n#### Step 5: Post-processing & Results Management\n\n- Results imported back into Teamcenter: stress plots, temperature distributions, flow fields, etc.\n- Visualization via **Simcenter 3D**, **JT format** (lightweight 3D), or web-based viewers.\n- Results tied back to:\n- Design versions\n- Simulation setup\n- Load cases\n- This creates a **traceable digital thread** from requirements → design → simulation → results.\n\n#### Step 6: Review, Sign-off, and Collaboration\n\n- Results shared with **design, manufacturing, and management teams** in Teamcenter.\n- Review workflows, e-signatures, and approvals integrated into PLM processes.\n- Simulation results influence **design changes** and **product validation reports**.\n\n### Azure CycleCloud adds several key advantages:\n\n- On-demand scaling: Automatically provisions Azure compute nodes when workloads spike, then scales down when jobs complete to reduce costs.\n- HPC Slurm scheduler integration: Supports popular schedulers like Slurm enabling smooth job submission from Teamcenter.\n- Multi-VM sizes & GPU support: Allows selecting the right mix of CPU/GPU VMs for different simulation workloads (e.g., CFD, FEA, ML-driven simulations).\n- Hybrid flexibility: Combine on-prem HPC with Azure bursting to handle peak demand without over-provisioning local hardware.\n- Cost governance: Built-in cost controls, job quotas, and reporting to track simulation expenses.\n- Security & compliance: Leverages Azure security, VNet isolation, and role-based access control for simulation data and compute resources.\n- Integration with Azure Storage: Simplifies access to input/output files using Azure Blob, Azure NetApp Files, or Lustre for HPC-grade throughput.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSiemens Teamcenter SPDM, when deployed on Azure HPC CycleCloud Workspaces, delivers a scalable and high-performance simulation data management solution. The integration with Azure CycleCloud enables dynamic provisioning of compute resources, allowing simulation workloads to scale elastically based on demand. This ensures optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency, especially during peak simulation cycles. With support for Slurm scheduling, multi-VM configurations, and GPU acceleration, SPDM on HPC CCWs empowers engineering teams to run complex simulations faster and more reliably. The architecture’s hybrid flexibility—combining on-premises and cloud bursting—further enhances throughput without overcommitting infrastructure, making it a robust foundation for enterprise-wide digital thread and product validation workflows.\n\nUpdated Aug 28, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[hpc](/tag/hpc?nodeId=board%3AAzureHighPerformanceComputingBlog)\n\n[!\\[Sunita_AZ0708&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-2.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/sunita_az0708/1500754) [Sunita_AZ0708](/users/sunita_az0708/1500754) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined August 29, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/sunita_az0708/1500754)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurehighperformancecomputingblog [Azure High Performance Computing (HPC) Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurehighperformancecomputingblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
