  "Description": "After using this for a month at this point, it suddenly stopped working on itself. It has an error message stating that it needs to \"initialize to an empty state\" after \"a part of the process has locked a portion of the file.\" There is no way I am aware of that can get an elaboration of what the problem is. I've tried logging in to my virtual desktop on a separate device, but it does not work. Any help or advice would be appreciated since there is no other method (that I'm aware of) that can allow me to contact support.",
