Deployment Center - a built-in feature in Azure Logic Apps Standard - in now available, with built-in support on your VS Code projects, making it easier to deploy Logic Apps from your source control repository.

Deployment Center makes it painless to roll back changes if something doesn’t work as expected.\n- **DevOps Friendl**y: Seamlessly plugs into your existing DevOps or CI/CD workflow, supporting a more unified automation strategy.\n\n## How does it work\n\nThere are two steps required to setup Deployment Center in Azure Logic Apps Standard:\n\n- First, you need to prepare your solution to connect to Deployment Center – we’ve updated the feature that generates deployment scripts in VS Code to support both Deployment Center and Azure DevOps now.
