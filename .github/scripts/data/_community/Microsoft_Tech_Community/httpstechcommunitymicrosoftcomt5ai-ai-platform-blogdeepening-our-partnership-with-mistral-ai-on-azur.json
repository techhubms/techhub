  "Description": "We’re excited to mark a new chapter in our collaboration with Mistral AI, a leading European AI innovator, with the launch of Mistral Document AI in Azure AI Foundry Models. This marks the first in a series of Mistral models coming to Azure as a serverless API, giving customers seamless access to Mistral’s cutting-edge capabilities, fully hosted, managed, and integrated into the Foundry ecosystem. This launch also deepens our support for sovereign cloud customers —especially in Europe.\n\nAt Microsoft, we believe Sovereign AI is essential for enabling organizations and regulated industries to harness the full potential of AI while maintaining control over their security, data, and governance. As Satya Nadella has said, “We want every country, every organization, to build AI in a way that respects their sovereignty—of data, of applications, and of infrastructure.”\n\nBy combining Mistral’s state-of-the-art models with Azure’s enterprise-grade reliability and scale we’re enabling customers to confidently deploy AI that meets strict regulatory and data sovereignty requirements.\n\n**Mistral Document AI** **By the Mistral AI Team**\n\n“Enterprises today are overwhelmed with documents—contracts, forms, research papers, invoices—holding critical information that’s often trapped in scanned images and PDFs. With nearly 90% of enterprise data stored in unstructured formats, traditional OCR simply can’t keep up.\n\nMistral Document AI is built with a multimodal approach that combines vision and language understanding, it interprets documents with contextual intelligence and delivers structured outputs that reflect the original layout—tables remain tables, headings remain headings, and images are preserved alongside the text.”\n\n![]()\n\n**Key Capabilities**\n\n- Document Parsing: Mistral Document AI interprets complex layouts and extracts rich structures such as tables, charts, and LaTeX-formatted equations with markdown-style clarity.\n\n- Multilingual & Multimodal: The model supports dozens of languages and understands both text and visual elements, making it well-suited for global, diverse datasets.\n\n- Structured Output & Doc-as-Prompt: Mistral Document AI delivers results in structured formats like JSON, enabling easy downstream integration with databases or AI agents. This supports use cases like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where document content becomes a prompt for subsequent queries.\n\n**Use Cases**\n\n- Document Digitization: Process archives of scanned PDFs or handwritten forms into structured digital records.\n\n- Knowledge Extraction: Transform research papers, technical manuals, or customer guides into machine-readable formats.\n\n- RAG pipelines and Intelligent Agents: Integrate structured output into pipelines that feed AI systems for Q&A, summarization, and more.\n\n**Mistral Document AI on Azure AI Foundry**\n\nYou can now access Mistral Document AI’s capabilities through Azure AI Foundry as a serverless Azure model, sold directly from Microsoft.\n\n- One-Click Deployment (Serverless) – With a few clicks, you can deploy the model as a serverless REST API, without needing to provision any GPU machines or container hosts. This makes it easy to get started.\n\n- Enterprise-Grade Security & Privacy – Because the model runs within your Azure environment, you get network isolation and data security out of the box. All inferencing happens in Azure’s cloud under your account, so your documents aren’t sent to a third-party server. Azure AI Foundry ensures your data stays private (no data leaves the Azure region you choose) and offers compliance with enterprise security standards. This is critical for sensitive use cases like banking or healthcare documents.\n\n- Integrated Responsible AI Capabilities – With Mistral Doc AI running in Azure AI Foundry, you can apply Azure’s built-in Responsible AI tools—such as content filtering, safety system monitoring, and evaluation frameworks—to ensure your deployments align with your organization’s ethical and compliance standards.\n\n- Observability & Monitoring – Foundry’s monitoring features give you full visibility into model usage, performance, and cost. You can track API calls, latency, and error rates, enabling proactive troubleshooting and optimization.\n\n- Agent Services Enablement – You can connect Mistral Document AI to Azure AI Agent Service, enabling intelligent agents to process, reason over, and act on extracted document data—unlocking new automation and decision-making scenarios.\n\n- Azure Ecosystem Integration – Once deployed, the Mistral Document AI endpoint can easily plug into your existing Azure workflows. And because it’s part of Foundry, you can manage it alongside other models in a unified way. This interoperability accelerates the development of intelligent applications.\n\n**Getting Started: Deploying and Using Mistral Document AI on Azure**\n\n![]()\n\nSetting up Mistral Document AI on Azure AI Foundry is straightforward. Here’s a quick guide to get you up and running:\n\n- Create an Azure AI Foundry workspace – Ensure you have an Azure subscription (pay-as-you-go, not a free trial) and create an AI Foundry hub and project in the Azure portal\n- Deploy the Mistral Document AI model – In the Azure AI Foundry Model Catalog, search for “mistral-document-ai-2505”. Then click the Deploy button. You’ll be prompted to select a pricing plan – choose deploy.\n- Call the Mistral Document AI API – Once deployed, using the model is as easy as calling a REST API. You can do this from any programming language or even a command-line tool like cURL.\n- Integrate and iterate – With the OCR results in hand, you can integrate Mistral Document AI into your workflows.\n\n![]()![]()\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMistral Document AI joins Azure AI Foundry as one of the several tools available to help organizations unlock insights from unstructured documents. This launch reflects our continued commitment to bringing the latest, most capable models into Foundry, giving developers and enterprises more choice than ever.\n\nWhether you’re digitizing records, building knowledge bases, or enhancing your AI workflows, Azure AI Foundry offers powerful and accessible solutions.\n\n**Pricing**\n\n| **Model Name** | **Pricing /1K pages** | | --- | --- | | mistral-document-ai-2505 Global | $3 | | mistral-document-ai-2505 Regional | $3.3 |\n\n**Resources**\n\n- [Explore Mistral Document AI](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/mistral-document-ai-2505)\n- [MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models)\n- [Github Code Samples](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/mistral/python)",
