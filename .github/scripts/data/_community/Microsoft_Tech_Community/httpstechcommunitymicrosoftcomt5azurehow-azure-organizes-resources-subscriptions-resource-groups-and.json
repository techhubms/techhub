  "Description": "When you start using Microsoft Azure for deploying applications or managing cloud infrastructure, understanding how Azure organizes its resources is fundamental. Azure provides a structured hierarchy—**Management Groups**, **Subscriptions**, and **Resource Groups**—that helps you manage, secure, and govern your resources effectively.\n\nThink of it like this: your Azure environment is a large, well-organized digital enterprise. Management Groups are the corporate headquarters, Subscriptions are individual departments, and Resource Groups are teams within those departments working on specific projects.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore in detail how each of these levels functions, how they relate to each other, and how you can use them to streamline governance, billing, and access management in Azure.\n\n[https://dellenny.com/how-azure-organizes-resources-subscriptions-resource-groups-and-management-groups-explained/](https://dellenny.com/how-azure-organizes-resources-subscriptions-resource-groups-and-management-groups-explained/)",
