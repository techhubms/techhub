A great place to learn about all the Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) options is in our blog post, [When to use Windows 10 Extended Security Updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/when-to-use-windows-10-extended-security-updates/4102628).\n\nIn this article, I will describe the Windows 10 lifecycle for Azure Virtual Desktop across the following scenarios:\n\n- Existing session hosts running Windows 10\n\n- Creating new session hosts with Windows 10\n\n- Microsoft 365 Apps support for Windows 10\n\n- Windows 10 ESU support\n\n## Existing session hosts running Windows 10\n\nAll existing Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts running Windows 10 22H2 are entitled to Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) at no additional cost—read about the [Extended Security Updates (ESU) program for Windows 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates) for more information. The ESU program enables PCs to continue to receive critical and important security updates. ESUs will be offered on all existing session hosts running Windows 10, version 22H2, when a Windows Update scan or Autopatch is run, without requiring any admin action. ESUs will be installed based on the Windows Update configurations of each session host and are applied automatically after a session host is deployed.\n\n## Creating new session hosts with Windows 10\n\nThere are two Windows 10 22H2 client multi-session images in Azure Marketplace: one with Microsoft 365 Apps and one without. The image with Microsoft 365 Apps will be retired and removed from Azure Marketplace on April 14, 2026, while the image without Microsoft 365 Apps will remain until 2028.\n\nThe image without Microsoft 365 Apps will receive the last service update in October 2025. Between October 2025 and April 2026, newly-deployed session hosts will need to install ESUs to be current. Microsoft recommends switching to Windows 11 for a more secure Windows experience.\n\nFor more information on ESU availability and end dates, please see [Product Lifecycle FAQ - Extended Security Updates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/extended-security-updates).\n\n## Microsoft 365 Apps support for Windows 10\n\nRead [Windows 10 end of support and Microsoft 365 Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/windows-10-support) to learn more.\n\n## Windows 10 ESU support\n\nWe will determine if the issue pertains to Windows 365 or with Windows 10. If the issue is determined to be with Windows 365, we will support as expected and work towards a resolution to your reported issue. If the issue is determined to pertain to the operating system, we will request/require an attempt to reproduce the same issue on a currently supported version of Windows 11. If that issue is able to reproduce on Windows 11, we will work that issue as it is supported. Once resolved, and if applicable, we can attempt to apply that same solution to the originally reported Windows 10 system. If the Windows 11 solution does not resolve the issue on Windows 10, we would recommend upgrading to Windows 11 as Windows 10 is no longer supported.\n\nStay up to date!
