  "Title": "Locked out of Azure account for 5 months! Spent hours on phone, still no resolution! PLEASE HELP!!!",
  "EnhancedContent": "As per the title, back in April I somehow managed to lock myself out of my Azure portal. Typically to sign in my browser would auto-fill in the password field - for some reason that fateful day the auto-fill function didn't work. So I typed in what I believed to be the password, it wasn't. Annoyed, I typed in a few more passwords (even checked browser password manager to ensure I was typing the correct password) and finally locked myself out.\n\nWorse still, the email address that Microsoft wanted to send its verification code as a back-up contingency is no longer active (domain wasn't renewed and has since been bought). So Microsoft is sending a verification email to a dead email address... When I try to reset the password via Microsoft's questionnaire, once submitted I then get an automated email response back stating I haven't provided enough correct/relevant information, so the password can't be reset.\n\nI have long since lost any hope or faith in Microsoft rectifying this issue. Being courteous on the phone and apologising constantly is all well and good, but is only meaningful if there is a resolution. All that's happened is I've been passed around from one department to another and back again, before eventually being ghosted back in the summer. I have since opened another support ticket which is already winding its way around to ultimately leading me down another dead end.\n\nAt this stage, all I want is for Microsoft to release my SQL database (my intellectual property) back to me. I am able to provide old invoices relating to my Azure account (when I was able to log in and download invoices!), as well as proof of ID to prove I am who I say I am - enough is enough!\n\nPlease advise.",
