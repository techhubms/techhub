Each post answers a real question from the community with simple, practical guidance to help you build smarter agents.\n\nToday‚Äôs question comes from a developer that‚Äôs right at the beginning of their agent building journey and needs a little help choosing a model.\n\n# üí¨ *Dear Agent Support*\n\n*I‚Äôm overwhelmed by all the model options out there. Some are small, some are huge. Some are free, some cost a lot. Some say ‚Äúmultimodal‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure if I need that. How do I choose the right model for my agent?*\n\nGreat question! Model choice is one of the most important design decisions you‚Äôll make. Pick something too small, and your agent may struggle with complex tasks. Go too big, and you could be paying for power you don‚Äôt need. Let‚Äôs break down the key factors to consider.\n\n# üß© Capabilities vs. Use Case\n\nThe first‚Äîand most important‚Äîquestion isn‚Äôt *which* model is ‚Äúbest.‚Äù It‚Äôs *what does my agent actually need to do?*\n\nHere‚Äôs a few angles to think through:\n\n- **Input and Output Types**\nWill your agent only handle text, or does it need to process other formats like images, audio, or structured data? Models differ in how many modalities they support and in how well they can handle outputs that must follow strict formatting.\n- **Complexity of Tasks**\nSimple, transactional tasks (like pulling information from a document or answering straightforward queries) don‚Äôt require the same reasoning depth as tasks that involve planning, multi-step logic, or open-ended creativity. Define the level of reasoning and adaptability your agent needs.\n- **Control Requirements**\nSome agents need highly controlled outputs (think JSON schemas for downstream services), while others benefit from free-form creativity. The degree of control you need (i.e. structured output, function calling, system prompt) should guide model choice.\n- **Domain Knowledge**\nDoes your agent operate in a general-purpose domain, or does it need strong understanding of a specific area (like legal, medical, or technical documentation)? Consider whether you‚Äôll rely on the model‚Äôs built-in knowledge, retrieval from external sources, or fine-tuning for domain expertise.\n- **Interaction Style**\nWill users interact with the agent in short, direct prompts, or longer, conversational exchanges? Some models handle chat-like, multi-turn contexts better than others, while others excel at single-shot completions.\n\nIn short: start by mapping out your agent‚Äôs needs in terms of data types, reasoning depth, control, domain, and interaction style. Once you have that picture, it‚Äôs much easier to narrow down which models are a genuine fit, and which ones would be mismatched.\n\n# ‚öñÔ∏è Performance vs. Cost\n\nOnce you know what your agent needs to do, the next trade-off is between performance and cost. Bigger models are often more capable, but they also come with higher latency, usage costs, and infrastructure requirements. The trick is to match ‚Äúenough performance‚Äù to the real-world expectations for your agent.\n\nHere are some factors to weigh:\n\n- **Task Complexity vs. Model Size**\nIf your agent‚Äôs tasks involve nuanced reasoning, long-context conversations, or open-ended problem solving, a more capable (and often larger) model may be necessary. On the other hand, for lightweight lookups or structured Q&A, a smaller model can perform just as well, and more efficiently.\n- **Response Time Expectations**\nLatency matters. A model that takes 8‚Äì10 seconds to respond may be fine in a batch-processing workflow but frustrating in a real-time chat interface. Think about how quickly your users expect the agent to respond and whether you‚Äôre willing to trade speed for accuracy.\n- **Budget and Token Costs**\nLarger models consume more tokens per request, which translates to higher costs, especially if your agent will scale to many users. Consider both *per-request cost* and *aggregate monthly cost* based on expected usage volume.\n- **Scaling Strategy**\nSome developers use a ‚Äútiered‚Äù approach: route simple queries to a smaller, cheaper model and reserve larger models for complex tasks. This can balance performance with budget without compromising user experience. The [Azure AI Founder Model Router](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/model-router) performs in a similar manner.\n- **Experimentation Over Assumptions**\nDon‚Äôt assume the largest model is always required. Start with something mid-range, test it against your use case, and only scale up if you see gaps. This iterative approach often prevents overspending.\n\nAt the end of the day, performance isn‚Äôt about squeezing the most power out of a model, it‚Äôs about choosing the *right amount of capability* for the job, without paying for what you don‚Äôt need.\n\n# üîë Licensing and Access\n\nEven if you‚Äôve found a model that looks perfect on paper, practical constraints around access and licensing can make or break your choice. These considerations often get overlooked until late in the process, but they can have big downstream impacts.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\n- **Where the Model Lives**\nSome models are only accessible through a hosted API (like on a cloud provider), while others are open source and can be self-hosted. Hosted APIs are convenient and handle scaling for you, but they also lock you into availability, pricing, and rate limits set by the provider. Self-hosting gives you control, but also means managing infrastructure, updates, and security yourself.\n- **Terms of Use**\nPay attention to licensing restrictions. Some providers limit usage for commercial products, sensitive data, or high-risk domains (like healthcare or finance). Others may require explicit consent or premium tiers to unlock certain capabilities.\n- **Data Handling and Privacy**\nIf your agent processes sensitive or user-specific data, you‚Äôll need to confirm whether the model provider logs, stores, or uses data for training. Check for features like ‚Äúno data retention‚Äù modes, private deployments, or enterprise SLAs if compliance is critical.\n- **Regional Availability**\nCertain models or features may only be available in specific regions due to infrastructure or regulatory constraints. This matters if your users are global, or if you need to comply with data residency laws (e.g., keeping data in the EU).\n- **Support for Deployment Options**\nConsider whether the model can be deployed in the way you need‚ÄîAPI-based integration, on-prem deployment, or edge devices. If you‚Äôre building something that runs locally (say, on a mobile app), an enormous cloud-only model won‚Äôt be practical.\n- **Longevity and Ecosystem**\nModels evolve quickly. Some experimental models may not be supported long-term, while others are backed by a stable provider with ongoing updates. Think about how much you want to bet on a model that might disappear in six months versus one with a roadmap you can count on.\n\nModel choice isn‚Äôt just about capability and performance, it‚Äôs also about whether you *can* use it under the terms, conditions, and environments that your project requires.\n\n# üîç Exploring Models with Azure AI Foundry\n\n![]()\n\nOnce you‚Äôve thought through capabilities, performance trade-offs, and licensing, the next step is exploring what‚Äôs available to you. If you‚Äôre building with Azure, this is where the [Azure AI Foundry Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/foundry-models-overview) **** becomes invaluable. Instead of guessing which model might fit, you can browse, filter, and compare options directly, complete with detailed model cards that outline features, intended use cases, and limitations.\n\nThink of the model catalog as your ‚Äúshopping guide‚Äù for models: it helps you quickly spot which ones align with your agent‚Äôs needs and gives you the fine print before you commit.\n\n# üîÅ Recap\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick rundown of what we covered:\n\n- **Start with capabilities.** Match the model‚Äôs strengths to the inputs, outputs, and complexity your agent requires.\n- **Balance performance with cost.** Bigger isn‚Äôt always better. Pick the right level of capability without overspending.\n- **Review licensing and access.** Make sure the model is available in your region, permitted for your use case, and deployed in the way you need.\n- **Explore before you build.** Use the Azure AI Foundry Model Catalog to filter options, read model cards, and test in the Playground.\n\n# üì∫ Want to Go Deeper?\n\nWith so many new models available on an almost daily basis, it can be a challenge to keep up with what‚Äôs new! However, our [Model Mondays](https://aka.ms/model-mondays) series has you covered! Each week, we bring to you the latest news in AI models.\n\nWe also recently launched our brand-new series: [Inside Azure AI Foundry](https://aka.ms/insideAIF). In this series, we dive deep into the latest AI models, tools, and platform features ‚Äî with practical demos and technical walkthroughs that show you how to integrate them into your workflows. It‚Äôs perfect for developers who want to see capabilities in action before deploying them in real projects.\n\n**As always remember, your agent doesn‚Äôt need the ‚Äúbest‚Äù model on paper‚Äîit needs the right model for the job it‚Äôs designed to do.**",
