  "EnhancedContent": "We are excited to announce the **general availability** of **[network security perimeter](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/network-security-perimeter-concepts)** support for Azure Storage accounts. A network security perimeter allows organizations to define a logical network isolation boundary for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) resources like Azure Storage accounts that are deployed outside your organization’s virtual networks. This restricts public network access to PaaS resources by default and provides secure communication between resources within the perimeter. Explicit inbound and outbound rules allow access to authorized resources.\n\nSecuring data within storage accounts requires a multi-layered approach, encompassing network access controls, authentication, and authorization mechanisms. [Network access controls](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security) for storage accounts can be defined into two broad categories - access from PaaS resources and from all other resources. For access from PaaS resources, organizations can leverage either broad controls through Azure [“trusted services](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#exceptions-for-trusted-azure-services)” or granular access using [resource instance rul](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#azure-resource-instance-rules) es. For other resources, access control may involve [IP-based firewall rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#ip-network-rules), allowing [virtual network access](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#virtual-network-rules), or by enabling [private endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-private-endpoints). However, the complexity of managing all these can pose significant challenges when scaled across large enterprises.\n\nMisconfigured firewalls, public network exposure on storage accounts, or excessively permissive policies heighten the risk of data exfiltration. It is often challenging to audit these risks at the application or storage account level, making it difficult to identify open exfiltration paths throughout all PaaS resources in an environment.\n\n**Network security perimeters** offer an effective solution to these concerns. First, by grouping assets such as Azure Key Vault and Azure Monitor in the same perimeter as your storage accounts, **communications between these resources are secured while disabling public access by default, thereby preventing data exfiltration to unauthorized destinations.**Then, they **centralize the management of network access** **controls** across numerous PaaS resources at scale by providing a single pane of glass. This approach promotes consistency in settings and reduces administrative overhead, thereby minimizing potential for configuration errors. Additionally, they **** provide **comprehensive control over both inbound and outbound access** across all the associated PaaS resources to authorized resources.\n\n# How do network security perimeters protect Azure Storage Accounts?\n\nNetwork security perimeters support granular resource access using **profiles**. All inbound and outbound rules are defined on a profile, and the profile can be applied to single or multiple resources within the perimeter.\n\nNetwork security perimeters provide two primary [operating modes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/network-security-perimeter-transition#access-mode-configuration-point-on-resource-associations): “Transition” mode (formerly referred to as “Learning” mode) and “Enforced” mode.\n\n- “Transition” mode acts as an initial phase when onboarding a PaaS resource into any network security perimeter. When combined with logging, this mode enables you to analyze current access patterns without disrupting existing connectivity.\n- “Enforced” mode is when are all defined perimeter rules replace all resource specific rules except private end points. After analyzing logs in “Transition” mode, you can tweak your perimeter rules as necessary and then switch to “Enforced” mode.\n\n## Benefits of network security perimeters\n\n- **Secure resource-to-resource** **communication**: Resources in the same perimeter communicate securely, keeping data internal and blocking unauthorized transfers. For example, an application’s storage account and its associated database, when part of the same perimeter can communicate securely. However, all communications from another database outside of the perimeter will be blocked to the storage account.\n- **Centralized network isolation** Administrators can manage firewall and resource access policies centrally in network security perimeters across all their PaaS resources in a single pane of glass, streamlining operations and minimizing errors.\n- **Prevent data exfiltration**: Centralized access control and logging of inbound and outbound network access attempts across all resources within a perimeter enables comprehensive visibility for compliance and auditing purposes and helps address data exfiltration.\n- **Seamless integration with existing Azure features**: Network security perimeter works in conjunction with private endpoints by allowing Private endpoint traffic to storage accounts within a perimeter\n- There is no additional cost to using network security perimeter.\n\n# Real-world customer scenarios\n\nLet us explore how network security perimeters specifically strengthen the security and management of Azure Storage accounts through common applications.\n\n## Create a Secure Boundary for Storage Accounts\n\nA leading financial organization sought to enhance the protection of sensitive client data stored in Azure Storage accounts. The company used Azure Monitor with a Log Analytics workspace to collect and centralize logs from all storage accounts, enabling constant monitoring and alerts for suspicious activity. This supported compliance and rapid incident response. They also used Azure Key Vault to access customer-managed encryption keys.\n\nThey configured network access controls on each communication path from these resources to the storage account. They disabled public network access and employed a combination of Virtual Network (Vnet), firewall rules, private endpoints, and service endpoints. However, this created a huge overhead that had to be continuously managed as and when additional resources required access to the storage account.\n\nTo address this, the company implemented network security perimeters, and blocked public and untrusted access to their storage account by default. By placing the specific Azure Key Vault and Log Analytics Workspace within the same network security perimeter as the storage account, the organization achieved a secure boundary around their data in an efficient manner. Additionally, to let an authorized application access this data, they defined an inbound access rule in the profile governing their storage account, thereby restricting access for the application to only the required PaaS resources.\n\n## Prevent Data Exfiltration from Storage Accounts\n\nOne of the most dangerous data exfiltration attacks is when an attacker obtains the credentials to a user account with access to an Azure Storage account, perhaps through phishing or credential stuffing. In a traditional setup, this attacker could potentially connect from anywhere on the internet and initiate large-scale data exfiltration to external servers, putting sensitive business or customer information at risk.\n\nWith network security perimeter in place, however, only resources within perimeter or authorized external resources can access the storage account, drastically limiting the attacker’s options. Even if they have valid credentials, network security perimeter rules block the attacker’s attempts to connect from an unapproved network or unapproved machines within a compromised network. Furthermore, the perimeter enforces strict outbound traffic controls: storage accounts inside the perimeter cannot send data to any external endpoint unless a specific outbound rule permits it.\n\nRestricting inbound access and tightly controlling outbound data flows enhances the security of sensitive data in Azure Storage accounts. The presence of robust network access control on top of storage account credentials creates multiple hurdles for attackers to overcome and significantly reduces the risk of both unauthorized access and data exfiltration.\n\n## Unified Access Management across the entire Storage estate\n\nA Large retailer found it difficult to manage multiple Azure Storage accounts. Typically, updating firewall rules or access permissions involved making repeated changes for each account or using complex scripts to automate the process. This approach not only increased the workload but also raised the risk of inconsistent settings or misconfigurations, which could potentially expose data.\n\nWith network security perimeter, the retailed grouped storage accounts under a perimeter and sometimes using subsets of accounts under different perimeters. For accounts requiring special permissions within a single perimeter, the organization created separate profiles to customize inbound and outbound rules  specific to them.  Administrators could now define and update access policies at the profile level, with rules immediately enforced across every storage account and other resources associated with the profile. The updates consistently applied to all resources for both blocking public internet access and for allowing specific internal subscriptions, thus reducing gaps and simplifying operations.\n\nThe network security perimeter also provided a centralized log of all network access attempts on storage accounts, eliminating the need for security teams to pull logs separately from each account. It showed what calls accessed accounts, when, and where, starting immediately after enabling logs in the “Transition” mode, and then continuing into Enforced mode. This streamlined approach enhances the organization’s compliance reporting, accelerated incident response, and improved understanding of information flow across the cloud storage environment.\n\n# Getting started\n\nExplore this [Quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/nsppublicdocs), to implement a network security perimeter and configure the right profiles for your storage accounts.
