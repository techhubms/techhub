  "Description": "I have a Azure VM which resides on a subnet that has UDR to send all traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 through our firewall which in turn sends the http and https traffic to our proxy. I am having problems executing graph queries on this VM. \"connect-mggraph\" succeeds because \"Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory\" service endpoint is there on this subnet. But after that query to get a user or anything else throws \"an error occurred\" message. My thinking is that the traffic is not being sent over https/http and thus not being forwarded to our proxy from the firewall. Thus , I want to see if it is possible to send this traffic through a Azure Service Endpoint instead?",
