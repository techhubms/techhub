Conclusion\n\n## **1. Introduction**\n\nAnthropic, the company behind Claude, recently acquired the JavaScript runtime startup Bun, marking one of the most significant shifts in the modern JavaScript ecosystem since the arrival of Node.js and Deno. This acquisition signals more than a business move, it represents a strategic consolidation of performance-oriented tooling, developer ergonomics, and the future of AI-accelerated software development. At the center of this momentum lies a powerful trio: Bun, Hono, and Vite.\n\nBun is a next-generation JavaScript runtime that reimagines everything from dependency installation to HTTP servers, bundling, and execution speed.\n\nOn top of Bun, frameworks like Hono provide an elegant, lightweight approach to building APIs and full web applications. Hono embraces the Web Standard API model while optimizing for speed and minimal footprint.\n\nFor front-end development, Vite completes the trio. Vite provides lightning-fast local development through native ES modules and an optimized build pipeline. When paired with Bun, the developer experience becomes even smoother, as Bun accelerates not only the dev server but also the entire build process. The result is a full-stack workflow where front-end and back-end both benefit from a consistent, high-performance environment.\n\nThis article will guide you through deploying a Bun + Hono + Vite application to an Azure Linux Web App.\n\n## **2. Local Environment**\n\nThe development environment used in this example is a Docker container. All project creation, modification, and testing will take place inside this environment.\n\nWe will build an application using **Bun + Hono + Vite**, containing three endpoints:\n\n- **/** : The root endpoint, which displays *Hello Bun Hono Vite*\n- **/api/hello** : A static endpoint\n- **/api/backend** : A runtime endpoint executed on the server, returning computed results for the frontend to display\n\n### Create the Docker development environment\n\nThis command generates a Bun + Hono + Vite project.\n\n``` docker run --rm -it -v \"$PWD\":/app -w /app oven/bun:latest bunx create-vite . --template vanilla-ts ```\n\nFollow the prompts as shown in the image and make the appropriate selections. After completing the prompts, the corresponding project files will be created.\n\nAt this point, you may press **Ctrl + C** to stop the running Bun server.\n\nNext, install **Hono**:\n\n``` docker run --rm -it -v \"$PWD\":/app -w /app oven/bun:latest bun add hono ```\n\n### Create 4 files and edit 2 files\n\n#### **Create .vscode/settings.json**\n\nThis file serves two purposes:\n\n1. To prevent the large node\\_modules folder from being uploaded during deployment. Uploading it wastes bandwidth and may cause compatibility issues between local and production environments.\n2. To disable *ORYX BUILD* from interfering in the deployment process. We will use a custom startup script to handle all build tasks instead.\n\n``` { \"appService.zipIgnorePattern\": [ \"node_modules{,/**}\", \".git{,/**}\", \".vscode{,/**}\" ], \"appService.showBuildDuringDeployPrompt\": false } ```\n\n#### **Create vite.config.ts**\n\nThis file configures Vite’s **base path** to use **relative paths** instead of absolute paths. Although this does not affect the production environment, it is essential locally when URLs and ports may differ.\n\n``` import { defineConfig } from 'vite'; export default defineConfig({ base: './', }); ```\n\n#### **Create server.ts**\n\nThis file configures backend routing using Hono and sets up the Bun server. It includes several test endpoints, some static, and some executed at runtime.\n\n``` import { Hono } from 'hono'; import { serveStatic } from 'hono/bun'; const app = new Hono(); app.get('/api/hello', (c) => { return c.text('this is api/hello'); }); app.get('/api/backend', (c) => { const result = 1 + 1; return c.json({ message: \"this is /api/backend\", calc: `1 + 1 = ${result}`, value: result, }); });\n\napp.use('/assets/*', serveStatic({ root: './dist' })); app.use('/*', serveStatic({ root: './dist' })); app.get('/', serveStatic({ path: './dist/index.html' }));\n\nconst port = Number(process.env.PORT ?? 3000); export default { port, fetch: app.fetch, }; ```\n\n#### **Create startup.sh**\n\nThis script serves several important roles:\n\n- Remove any node\\_modules folders or tar archives created by ORYX during deployment\n- Install the Bun runtime\n- Fully take over the ORYX build process\n- Start the Bun server as the final step\n\n``` #!/bin/bash set -e echo \"===== Startup script running =====\" cd /home/site/wwwroot echo \"Cleaning up Oryx-generated node_modules...\" if [ -d /node_modules ]; then echo \"Removing /node_modules ...\" rm -rf /node_modules fi if [ -f node_modules.tar.gz ]; then echo \"Removing node_modules.tar.gz ...\" rm -f node_modules.tar.gz fi echo \"Oryx cleanup complete.\" export BUN_INSTALL=/home/site/wwwroot/.bun export PATH=\"$BUN_INSTALL/bin:/home/site/wwwroot/node_modules/.bin:$PATH\" export NODE_PATH=\"/home/site/wwwroot/node_modules\" if [ ! -f \"$BUN_INSTALL/bin/bun\" ]; then echo \"Bun not found.

Conclusion**\n\nBun + Hono + Vite form a cohesive ecosystem that embodies the next era of JavaScript development: fast, compact, ergonomic, and deeply aligned with modern infrastructure needs. It is particularly well-suited for AI applications, where latency, concurrency, and rapid iteration matter more than ever. From streaming inference endpoints to vector database integrations, this stack offers the responsiveness and scalability essential for AI-powered systems.\n\nUpdated Dec 05, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure app service](/tag/azure%20app%20service?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[azure paas](/tag/azure%20paas?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[best practices](/tag/best%20practices?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[devops](/tag/devops?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[node.js](/tag/node.js?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[react](/tag/react?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[web apps](/tag/web%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[theringe&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMzU3ODIyLVIxNkJKdg?image-coordinates=0%2C0%2C800%2C800&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/theringe/1357822) [theringe](/users/theringe/1357822) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined April 08, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/theringe/1357822)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
