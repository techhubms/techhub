  "EnhancedContent": "We’re thrilled to announce a game-changing enhancement in Azure Migrate. The ***storage utilization-based recommendations***, a feature designed to help you right-size your storage workloads and maximize savings. By focusing on actual storage usage instead of allocated capacity, you can significantly reduce costs and accelerate their cloud journey. This feature brings a new level of precision to your migration planning and business case.\n\n#### **Why This Matters**\n\nIn our analysis across thousands of on-premises environments, we observed a striking trend: **nearly 40% of allocated storage is overprovisioned**. This means customers are paying for capacity they don’t actually use. Traditional assessments often rely on allocated storage, leading to inflated cost estimates and suboptimal resource planning.\n\n#### **What’s New**\n\nAzure Migrate now **honors actual storage utilization** rather than allocated capacity when generating:\n\n- **Assessment recommendations** for right-sizing your storage workloads.\n- **Business case calculations** for accurate cost projections.\n\nThis shift ensures:\n\n- **Lower migration cost projections**: Pay for what you use, not what you’ve overprovisioned.\n- **Optimized cloud footprint**: Reduce unnecessary storage allocation in Azure.\n- **Faster ROI**: Build a business case that reflects true utilization, accelerating decision-making.\n\n#### **Customer Impact**\n\nBy leveraging utilization-based insights, organizations can unlock **significant savings** and operate with greater efficiency. For example, if 40% of your storage is overprovisioned, this feature could cut your projected Azure storage costs dramatically, freeing up budget for innovation.\n\n#### **How to Get Started**\n\n1. Deploy an appliance in your on-premises environment.\n2. **Build the business case or create an Azure Migrate Assessment** for your on-premises workloads.\n3.
