  "Description": "Ignite 2025 highlighted a clear trend across customer and partner discussions: modern workloads—AI inference, data-intensive analytics, and globally distributed applications—require infrastructure that delivers **consistent performance, rapid scale-out, and adaptive behavior under real-world pressure**. The focus this year was on practical capabilities that remove bottlenecks, simplify operations, and provide the compute foundation needed to support the next wave of innovation.\n\nAzure’s newest advancements reflect that direction. Breakthroughs like **Direct Virtualization** enable low-latency access to GPUs and NVMe; **Large Container sizes** push new limits for AI/ML and analytics; **VM Applications** streamline global deployments; **Scheduled Actions** bring automation to thousands of VMs; **Azure Compute Gallery** boosts resiliency with Soft Delete and ZRS; and **VMSS Instance Mix** improves capacity acquisition through flexible SKU selection.\n\nThis retrospective highlights the capabilities that shaped Ignite and how Azure is advancing a high-performance, adaptive compute platform built for the next generation of workloads.\n\n# Direct Virtualization – Breaking Barriers for Performance\n\nDirect Virtualization generated a lot of excitement at Ignite, enabling **performance-sensitive workloads** like AI inference and gaming to launch faster and more affordably. Key highlights:\n\n- **Direct access** to devices like NvMe disks and GPUs with near Bare metal performance.\n- **Isolation for child VMs** hosting hostile workloads.\n- **Lower latency and cost efficiency** for demanding applications.\n- **High throughput data access from child VMs** for high performance workloads.\n\n![]()\n\nAvailable in limited preview, please sign up here: [aka.ms/](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faka.ms%2FVirtualHostPreview&data=05%7C02%7CDarren.Moss%40microsoft.com%7C34a1c723688944c2c34408de1e425c1c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638981467612509029%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=gmkilcTC6KBr59lcy9JxqStUMACGG7gIMR5ErShH%2BQE%3D&reserved=0)[DirectVirtualizationPreview](https://aka.ms/DirectVirtualizationPreview)\n\n# Large Containers sizes: Supercharging Compute-Intensive Apps\n\nLarge containers were well received at Ignite. Why? Because they unlock **massive performance gains** for AI/ML training, big data analytics, and high-throughput services. With higher vCPU and memory configurations, customers can:\n\n- **Accelerate AI workloads**: Train models faster and scale inference seamlessly.\n- **Simplify orchestration**: Fewer containers, less complexity.\n- **Reduce latency**: Minimize inter-container chatter for blazing-fast execution.\n\n![]()\n\nNow **Generally Available**!\n\nLearn more: [aka.ms/](https://aka.ms/bigcontainersblog)[bigcontainersblog](https://aka.ms/bigcontainersblog)\n\n# VM Applications: Global Reach, Zero Hassle\n\nWe were happy to announce **General Availability for VM applications**. Managing apps across thousands of VMs, at Ignite we showcased how **VM Applications** make this effortless. Customers loved the ability to:\n\n- **Deploy up to 25 applications** (2GB each) per VM together. ****\n- **Deploy consistently** across regions with automatic replication.\n- **Automate updates** without manual intervention.\n- **Scale globally** with confidence.\n\nThis simplifies operational overhead for enterprises running distributed workloads.\n\n![]()\n\nLearn more: [https://aka.ms/VMApps/blogs/ignite2025](https://aka.ms/VMApps/blogs/ignite2025)\n\n# Scheduled Actions: Automation at Scale\n\nOperational efficiency was a hot topic, and **Scheduled Actions**, now **Generally Available** solves this problem. Now you can schedule power operations for **up to 5,000 VMs in one go.** Scheduled actions enables:\n\n- **Cost optimization** during off-peak hours.\n- **Reliability** with built-in throttling safeguards.\n- **Time savings** through automation.\n- **Actions available in GA:** Start, Stop, Hibernate, with support for more actions coming soon!\n\n![]()\n\n# Azure Compute Gallery – Enhance resiliency\n\nAzure Compute Gallery (ACG) continues to evolve, introducing robust features that safeguard your virtual machine (VM) images and application artifacts. Two key resiliency innovations: the new Soft Delete feature (announced in preview) and Zonal Redundant Storage (ZRS) as the default storage type for image versions.\n\nThe combination of Soft Delete and ZRS by default provides Azure customers with enhanced operational reliability and data protection. Whether overseeing a suite of VM images for development and testing purposes or coordinating production deployments across multiple teams, these features offer the following benefits:\n\n- Mitigate operational risks associated with accidental deletions or regional outages.\n- Minimize downtime and reduce manual recovery processes.\n- Promote compliance and security through advanced access controls and transparent recovery procedures.\n\nRead more: [https://aka.ms/acgresiliencyblog](https://aka.ms/acgresiliencyblog)\n\n# Acquiring capacity at Scale\n\nWe know that capacity acquisition can get complicated and can prohibit scale. With SKU fungibility in a single deployment where you can define up to 5 SKUs using VMSS Instance Mix with allocation policies simplifies **capacity fungibility at scale**. Customers can:\n\n- **Mix up to five VM sizes** in a single scale set.\n- Use allocation strategies like **CapacityOptimized**, **LowestPrice**, or **Prioritized**.\n- Secure capacity during peak demand while optimizing costs.\n\nThis approach ensures agility and resilience for unpredictable workloads.\n\n# Best Practices\n\nWe also shared best practices for Scale and performance. The session emphasized:\n\n- **Using latest SKUs** for best performance and price/performance.\n- **Using Instance mix** for acquiring capacity at scale using different SKUs.\n- **Use VM Apps** for delivering apps reliably and at scale**.**\n- For Virtual Desktop use cases, **** use **Schedule actions for managing power states** at scale.\n- Building **resiliency and security** from the get-go.\n\nSession on-demand link: [ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/BRK173?source=/speakers/80665103-5e69-4b8c-ad15-1d1f84c8dd6a](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/BRK173?source=/speakers/80665103-5e69-4b8c-ad15-1d1f84c8dd6a)\n\n# Conclusion: Customer Excitement on AI + Azure Infra\n\nIgnite made it clear that scaling for performance is no longer about simply adding more compute; it’s about intelligent architecture, automation at scale, and flexible capacity models that adapt to real-world demands.
