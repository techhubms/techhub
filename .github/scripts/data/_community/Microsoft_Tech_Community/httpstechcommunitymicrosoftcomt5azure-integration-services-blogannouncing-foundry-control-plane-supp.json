To align to this Microsoft vision, you will find Logic Apps Agent Loop implementations participate in this holistic governance experience. This ensures that Logic Apps customers are included in the broader Microsoft agent ecosystem, without trade-offs!\n\nAgent governance isn’t just a technical safeguard—it’s the foundation for trust and scalability in the agentic era. As AI agents gain autonomy to make decisions and execute tasks, governance ensures they operate within ethical, secure, and compliant boundaries. Without clear guardrails, agents can introduce risks like unauthorized data access, regulatory violations, and costly errors that undermine business confidence. The Foundry Control Plane seeks to address all of these enterprise needs.\n\n## Public Preview Launch\n\nThere are no additional actions required by a customer to have their Agent Loop instances show up in the Foundry Control Plan. This support has been built-in, without any customer intervention.\n\nTo access the Foundry Control plan, navigate to this [link](https://ai.azure.com/) and then toggle on the new experience. Once in the new experience select a Foundry project followed by clicking on the **Operate** link in the upper right hand corner.\n\nNext, click **Assets** followed by selecting the appropriate **Subscription** and specify **Logic Apps Agent Loop** from the **Source**dropdown. You will now see your Agent Loop instances. For a selected row, you will also have access to additional capabilities such as stopping/starting the agent and deep linking to that particular instance.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\nA capability that we are actively working on is making Agent Loop telemetry also available to the Foundry Control Plan.\n\n**Note:** The images below represent pre-release capabilities.\n\nA list of conversations will be displayed. For each conversation you will see important information like token usage (inputs/outputs). To dive deeper into a specific conversation, click a specific trace instance to further explore that execution.\n\nOnce we have clicked on a specific trace id, we can see rich telemetry for that particular execution.\n\n## Additional Content\n\nTo see a demo of the Foundry Control Panel and Logic Apps in action, please check out the following video.\n\nUpdated Nov 21, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[ai](/tag/ai?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[logic apps](/tag/logic%20apps?nodeId=board%3AIntegrationsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[KentWeareMSFT&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMzc3NzYzLTM3MDMzN2lBMDQxNzRGQUE3REQ3MjUx?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/kentwearemsft/1377763) [KentWeareMSFT](/users/kentwearemsft/1377763) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined April 30, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/kentwearemsft/1377763)\n\n/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog [Azure Integration Services Blog](/category/azure/blog/integrationsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
