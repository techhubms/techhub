We’re hosting breakout sessions, showcasing demos at our booth, and most importantly, meeting directly with [customers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/customers/search?sq=%22Azure+VMware+Solution%22&amp;ff=&amp;p=2&amp;so=story_publish_date+desc&amp;q=Azure+VMware+Solution) to help them map the future of their VMware environments to take advantage of all the benefits of Microsoft Azure.\n\n[Join our Microsoft sessions](https://myevents.vmware.com/widget/vmware/explore2025lv/1752602253600001CiMq) to learn about the latest updates to Azure VMware Solution and discover why it's a great choice for a quick move to the cloud. Here are some of the recent enhancements to Azure VMware Solution:\n\n- **Azure VMware Solution is now in 35 regions**: Since the launch of AVS four years ago, we’ve been working to support customers globally with geographic expansion and I am pleased to report that it is now available in 35 Azure regions, more than any other cloud provider. Most recently added: Korea Central and Spain Central.  **We will also be** **launching AVS in eight more regions by the end of the year**: Belgium Central, Chile Central, Indonesia Central, New Zealand North, Norway East, Malaysia West, Poland Central, and South India. Check out the [Azure products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=azure-vmware&amp;rar=true&amp;regions=all) web page to find an AVS region near you.\n\n- **Azure VMware Solution runs VCF Private Clouds in Azure and supports portable VCF subscriptions.** Azure VMware Solution continues to support the VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) bundle from VMware.  All customers will experience the same Azure VMware Solution managed service, and with portable VCF subscription you only pay Microsoft for the Azure VMware Solution service and infrastructure. [Learn more](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/?p=36581).\n- **Azure VMware Solution approved DISA Provisional Authorization of Azure Government at IL5** Azure VMware Solution in Microsoft Azure Government was approved and added as a service within the DISA Provisional Authorization of Azure Government at Impact Level 5.
