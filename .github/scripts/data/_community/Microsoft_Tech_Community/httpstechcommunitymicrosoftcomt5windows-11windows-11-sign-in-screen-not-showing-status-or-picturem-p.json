  "Title": "Windows 11 Sign-In Screen Not Showing Status or Picture Information",
  "Description": "Hey All\n\nI am using Windows 11 Pro fully updated on three laptops - Gaming, Office, and smaller, lighter one I take on holiday. All three have the same settings.\n\nI use Windows Spotlght for my lock screen and choose \"weather and more\". It works fine when I choose to lock the PC. I get the Spotlight picture which changes each few days, a prompt to see the information about the picture, weather, and status info on some other apps. I see.\n\n![]() I also choose the option \"Show lock screen background on the sing-in screen\"\n\nOn all three laptops I get to see the Spotlight picture when I choose to reboot, cold boot, or log off.\n\nThe issue is that on two of the three I don't see the prompt to find out about the picture nor do I see weather or app status information. On one of them it works fine.\n\nOn the two that don't work I see what is below on the sign-on sreen, on the one that works it looks the same as the first picture.\n\n![]() The weirdest part is that if I reboot as part of a Windows Update, the two laptops that don't normally work show the sign-in screen like the good one (first pic). It only works for the one reboot post-update and then reverts to not working..\n\nSo to sum up.\n\nThe one that works\n\n- Cold boot = pic 1\n- Restart = pic 1\n- log off = pic 1\n- lock = pic 1\n- restart as part of Windows Update = pic 1\n\nThe two that have issues\n\n- Cold boot = pic 2\n- Restart = pic 2\n- log off = pic 2\n- lock = pic 1\n- restart as part of Windows Update = pic 1\n\nFor someone with a brain bigger than mine, can they see any reason why this might happen. Is there a clue in the behaviour that rebooting during a Windows Update would trigger the sign-in screen to show pic 1 on the two laptops that normally show opic 2?\n\nI have already tried the following.\n\nRe-installing Spotlight\n\nscannow /sfc\n\nDISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth\n\nDISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth\n\nDISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth\n\nAn in place Windows 11 repair - I did get excisted as the first book after the repair behaves the same as the reboot during an update, which I guess ir is.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nCheers\n\nMIck",
