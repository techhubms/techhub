  "Title": "How can I force to install Windows 11 on unsupported PC?",
  "Description": "I want to upgrade to Windows 11 from Windows 10 as I just received the news that it will be end of support soon. It is old DIY-PC but it is still a power horse. When I was trying to install Windows 11on this hardware, it came with an error message, saying this pc can't run this version of Windows 11.\n\nAfter that, I ran the pc health check tool and found out the process is not supported and no TPM 2.0. The hardware specs are:\n\n- Intel i7 6700k processor\n- Kingstone 32GB RAM\n- 512GB SSD\n- Running Windows 10 Home 22H2\n\nHow can I **install Windows 11 on unsupported PC**? I don't afford to buy a new PC now!\n\nThanks for your help",
