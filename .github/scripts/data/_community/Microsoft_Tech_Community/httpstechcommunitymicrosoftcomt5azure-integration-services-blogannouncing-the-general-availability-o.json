  "Description": "## **The XML Operations connector**\n\nWe have recently added two actions for the XML Operations connector: Parse XML with schema and Compose XML with schema. With this addition, Logic Apps customers can now interact with the token picker during design time. The tokens are generated from the XML schema provided by the customer. As a result, the XML document and its contained properties will be easily accessible, created and manipulated in the workflow.\n\n### **XML parse with schema**\n\nThe XML parse with schema allow customers to parse XML data using an XSD file (an XML schema file). XSD files need to be uploaded to the Logic App schemas artifacts or an Integration account. Once they have been uploaded, you need to enter the enter your XML content, the source of the schema and the name of the schema file. The XML content may either be provided in-line or selected from previous operations in the workflow using the token picker.\n\n![]()\n\nFor instance, the following is a parsed XML:\n\n![]()\n\n### **XML compose with schema**\n\n****\n\nThe XML compose with schema allows customers to generate XML data, using an XSD file. XSD files need to be uploaded to the Logic App schemas artifacts or an Integration account. Once they have been uploaded, you should select the XSD file along with entering the JSON root element or elements of your input XML schema.

If you want to assign an entire array token, use the array input mode icon in the Designer. This avoids unnecessary For Each loops and streamlines your workflow.\n\nFor instance, the following:\n\n| ![]() | ![]() | | --- | --- | | ***Click the Switch to input entire array*** | ***Enter your array token.*** |\n\n**Managing Non-UTF-8 Encoded XML**\n\n- **Leverage the encoding parameter in XML Compose.** Customers can specify the desired character encoding (e.g., iso-2022-jp for Japanese).

Downstream actions (e.g., HTTP Request) can consume this envelope directly.\n\n**Content-Type Header Management**\n\n- **XML Compose now specifies the exact character set in the Content-Type header.** This ensures downstream systems receive the correct encoding information.
