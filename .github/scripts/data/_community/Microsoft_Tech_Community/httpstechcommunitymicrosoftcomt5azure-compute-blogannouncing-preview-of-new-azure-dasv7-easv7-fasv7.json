  "Description": "Today, Microsoft is announcing preview of the new Azure AMD-based Virtual Machines (VMs), powered by 5th Generation AMD EPYC™ (Turin) processors. The preview includes general purpose (Dasv7 & Dalsv7 series), memory-optimized (Easv7 series) and compute-optimized (Fasv7, Falsv7, Famsv7 series) VMs, available with and without local disks. These VMs are in preview in the following Azure regions: East US 2, North Europe, and West US 3. To request access to the preview, please fill out the [Preview-Signup](https://aka.ms/AMDv7_PublicPreview_Signup).\n\nThe latest Azure AMD-based VMs deliver significant enhancements over the previous generation (v6) AMD-based VMs: improved CPU performance, greater scalability, and expanded configuration options to meet the needs of a wide range of workloads.\n\nKey improvements include:\n\n- **Up to 35% CPU performance improvement** compared to equivalent sized (v6) AMD-based VMs.\n- **Significant performance gains on other workloads:**\n- Up to 25% for Java-based workloads\n- Up to 65% for in-memory cache applications\n- Up to 80% for crypto workloads\n- Up to 130% for web server applications\n\n- **Maximum boost CPU frequency of 4.5 GHz**, enabling faster operations for compute-intensive workloads.\n- **Expanded VM sizes:** Dasv7-series, Dalsv7-series and Easv7-series now scale up to 160 vCPUs. Fasv7-series supports up to 80 vCPUs, with a new 1-core size.\n- **Increased memory capacity:** Dasv7-series now offers up to 640 GiB of memory. Easv7-series scales up to 1280 GiB and is ideal for memory-intensive applications.\n- **Enhanced remote storage performance:** VMs offer up to 20% higher IOPS and up to 50% greater throughput compared to similar sized previous generation (v6) VMs.\n- **New VM families introduced:** Fadsv7, Faldsv7, and Famdsv7 are now available with local disk support.\n- **Expanded constrained-core offerings:** New constrained-core sizes for Easv7 and Famsv7, available with and without local disks, helping to optimize licensing costs for core-based software licensing.\n\nThese enhancements make these latest VMs a compelling choice for customers seeking high performance, cost efficiency, and workload flexibility on Azure.\n\nAdditionally, these VMs leverage the latest [Azure Boost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-boost/overview) technology enhancements to performance and security of these new VMs. The new VMs utilize the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter ([MANA](https://aka.ms/manadocs)), a next-generation network interface that provides stable, forward-compatible drivers for Windows and Linux operating systems. These VMs also support the [NVMe](https://aka.ms/NVMeFAQ) protocol for both local and remote disks.\n\nThe 5th Generation AMD EPYC™ processor family, based on the newest ‘Zen 5’ core, provides enhanced capabilities for these new Azure AMD-based VM series such as AVX-512 with a full 512-bit data path for vector and floating-point operations, higher memory bandwidth, and improved instructions per clock compared to the previous generation. These updates provide increased throughput and ability to scale for compute-intensive tasks like AI and machine learning, scientific simulations, and financial analytics, among others. AMD Infinity Guard hardware-based security features, such as Transparent Secure Memory Encryption (TSME), continue in this generation to ensure sensitive information remains secure.\n\n![]()\n\nThese VMs support three memory (GiB)-to-vCPU ratios such as 2:1 (Dalsv7-series, Daldsv7-series, Falsv7-series and Faldsv7-series), 4:1 (Dasv7-series, Dadsv7-series, Fasv7-series and Fadsv7-series), and 8:1 (Easv7-series, Eadsv7-series, Famsv7-series and Famdsv7-series).\n\nThe Dalsv7-series are ideal for workloads that require less RAM per vCPU that can reduce costs when running non-memory intensive applications, including web servers, video encoding, batch processing and more. The Dasv7-series VMs work well for many general computing workloads, such as e-commerce systems, web front ends, desktop virtualization solutions, customer relationship management applications, entry-level and mid-range databases, application servers, and more. The Easv7-series VMs are ideal for workloads such as memory-intensive enterprise applications, data warehousing, business intelligence, in-memory analytics, and financial transactions.\n\nThe new Falsv7-series, Fasv7-series and Famsv7-series VM series do not have Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), meaning a vCPU equals a full core, which makes these VMs well-suited for compute-intensive workloads needing the highest CPU performance, such as scientific simulations, financial modeling and risk analysis, gaming, and more.\n\nIn addition to the standard sizes, the latest VM series are available in constrained-core sizes, with vCPU count constrained to one-half or one-quarter of the original VM size, giving you the flexibility to select the core and memory configuration that best fits your workloads.\n\nIn addition to the new VM capabilities, the previously announced [Azure Integrated HSM](https://aka.ms/AzureIntegratedHSM) (Hardware Security Module), will be in Preview soon with the latest Azure AMD-based VMs. Azure Integrated HSM is an ephemeral HSM cache that enables secure key management within Azure virtual machines by ensuring that cryptographic keys remain protected inside a FIPS 140-3 Level 3-compliant boundary throughout their lifecycle. To explore this new feature, please sign up using the form provided below.\n\nThese latest Azure AMD-based VMs will be charged during preview; pricing information will be shared with access to the VMs. Eligible new Azure customers can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and receive a $200 Azure credit.\n\nThe new VMs support all remote disk types. To learn more about the disk types and their regional availability, please refer to [Azure managed disk type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types). Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.\n\nYou can learn more about these latest Azure AMD-based VMs by visiting the specification pages at [Dasv7-series](https://aka.ms/Dasv7-series), [Dadsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Dadsv7-series), [Dalsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Dalsv7-series), [Daldsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Daldsv7-series), [Easv7-series](https://aka.ms/Easv7-series), [Eadsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Eadsv7-series), [Fasv7-series](https://aka.ms/Fasv7-series), [Fadsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Fadsv7-series), [Falsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Falsv7-series), [Faldsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Faldsv7-series), [Famsv7-series](https://aka.ms/Famsv7-series) and [Famdsv7-serie](https://aka.ms/Famdsv7-series)s.\n\nThe latest Azure AMD-based VMs provide options for your wide range of computing needs.
