  "Description": "I have my Azure landing zone setup but it isn't working as i expected.\n\nSo i have a vnet named vnet-lz-fw-001 with 2 subnets. External and Trusted.\n\nI then have a NVA Watchguard Firewall with an interface on each subnet.\n\nI then have 2 further vnets, vnet-lz-prod-001 and vnet-lz-id-001.\n\nEach of these vnets has peering to vnet-lz-fw-001 but no peering between each other.\n\nvnet-lz-prod-001 and vnet-lz-id-001 have user defined routes to point to each other via the trusted interface on the Watchguard NVA\n\nThe Watchguard firewall has static routes to point to each subnet in the vnets via the Trusted interface gateway address.\n\nVirtual machines in both vnet-lz-prod-001 and vnet-lz-id-001 can ping each other, but when they do its not routing via the Watchguard firewall. Is this as expected behavior?\n\nVirtual machines in both vnet-lz-prod-001 and vnet-lz-id-001 can ping the trusted interface on the Watchguard Firewall ok",
