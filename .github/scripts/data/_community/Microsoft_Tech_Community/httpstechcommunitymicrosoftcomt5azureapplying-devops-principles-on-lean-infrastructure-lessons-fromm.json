  "EnhancedContent": "Hi Azure Community,\n\nI'm a Microsoft Certified DevOps Engineer, and I want to share an unusual journey. I have been applying DevOps principles on traditional VPS infrastructure to scale to 102,000 users with 99.2% uptime.\n\nWhy am I posting this in an Azure community? Because I'm planning migration to Azure in 2026, and I want to understand: What mistakes am I already making that will bite me during migration?\n\nTHE CURRENT SETUP\n\nPlatform: Social commerce (West Africa) Users: 102,000 active Monthly events: 2 million Uptime: 99.2% Infrastructure: Single VPS Stack: PHP/Laravel, MySQL, Redis\n\nYes - one VPS. No cloud. No Kubernetes. No microservices.\n\nWHY I HAVEN'T USED AZURE YET\n\nHonest answer: Budget constraints in emerging market startup ecosystem.\n\nAt our current scale, fully managed Azure services would significantly increase monthly burn before product-market expansion. The funding we raised needs to last through growth milestones.\n\nThe trade: I manually optimize what Azure would auto-scale. I debug what Application Insights would catch. I do by hand what Azure Functions would automate.\n\nDEVOPS PRACTICES THAT KEPT US RUNNING\n\nEven on single-server infrastructure, core DevOps principles still apply:\n\nCI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions) • 3-5 deployments weekly • Zero-downtime deploys • Automated rollback on health check failures • Feature flags for gradual rollouts\n\nMonitoring & Observability • Custom monitoring (would love Application Insights) • Real-time alerting • Performance tracking and slow query detection • Resource usage monitoring\n\nAutomation • Automated backups • Automated database optimization • Automated image compression • Automated security updates\n\nInfrastructure as Code • Configs in Git • Deployment scripts • Environment variables • Documented procedures\n\nTesting & Quality • Automated test suite • Pre-deployment health checks • Staging environment • Post-deployment verification\n\nKEY OPTIMIZATIONS\n\nAsync Job Processing • Upload endpoint: 8 seconds → 340ms • 4x capacity increase\n\nDatabase Optimization • Feed loading: 6.4 seconds → 280ms • Strategic caching • Batch processing\n\nImage Compression • 3-8MB → 180KB (94% reduction) • Critical for mobile users\n\nCaching Strategy • Redis for hot data • Query result caching • Smart invalidation\n\nProgressive Enhancement • Server-rendered pages • 2-3 second loads on 4G\n\nWHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT FOR AZURE MIGRATION\n\nThis is where I need your help:\n\nArchitecture Decisions • App Service vs Functions + managed services? • MySQL vs Azure SQL? • When does cost/benefit flip for managed services?\n\nCost Management • How do startups manage Azure costs during growth? • Reserved instances vs pay-as-you-go? • Which Azure services are worth the premium?\n\nMigration Strategy • Lift-and-shift first, or re-architect immediately? • Zero-downtime migration with 102K active users? • Validation approach before full cutover?\n\nMonitoring & DevOps • Application Insights - worth it from day one? • Azure DevOps vs GitHub Actions for Azure deployments? • Operational burden reduction with managed services?\n\nDevelopment Workflow • Local development against Azure services? • Cost-effective staging environments? • Testing Azure features without constant bills?\n\nMY PLANNED MIGRATION PATH\n\nPhase 1: Hybrid (Q1 2026) • Azure CDN for static assets • Azure Blob Storage for images • Application Insights trial • Keep compute on VPS\n\nPhase 2: Compute Migration (Q2 2026) • App Service for API • Azure Database for MySQL • Azure Cache for Redis • VPS for background jobs\n\nPhase 3: Full Azure (Q3 2026) • Azure Functions for processing • Full managed services • Retire VPS\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THIS COMMUNITY\n\nQuestion 1: Am I making migration harder by waiting?
