  "Description": "*Authored by Sarah Zhou, Product Manager*\n\nWe’re excited to announce the addition of the D192 size to the Azure Dsv6 and Ddsv6-series Virtual Machines families, powered by the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8573C (Emerald Rapids) processor. Dsv6-series virtual machines use Azure managed disks only, while Ddsv6-series virtual machines offer local, temp storage disks. These sizes are now generally available in several Azure regions.\n\nThese new VM sizes offer 192 vCPUs and 768 GiB of RAM, making them ideal for general-purpose workloads such as enterprise-grade applications like SAP, SQL, in-memory analytics platforms, and large relational databases. They are also suitable for web and application servers with moderate to heavy traffic, batch processing tasks, developer and test environments, and other workloads requiring a balance of CPU performance and memory resources.\n\nAzure Boost delivers up to 400k IOPS and 12 GB/s remote storage throughput for these VMs with NVMe-enabled local and remote storage for scalable performance. Additionally, Intel® Total Memory Encryption (TME) provides secure memory data protection.\n\n##### **Key Highlights**\n\n- **Large Size:** 192 vCPUs with **** 768 GiB of RAM for demanding workloads.\n- [**Azure Boost**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-boost/overview?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json): Up to 400K IOPS and 12 GB/s remote storage throughput and up to 82 Gbps network bandwidth.\n- **Security First**: Intel® TME ensures data protection in system memory.\n- **NVMe Interface**: 3X improvement in local storage IOPS for low-latency access.\n\n##### **Specifications of the D192 Sizes**\n\nBelow is an overview of specifications offered by the D192 VM sizes. Please refer to the Azure [Dsv6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/dsv6-series?tabs=sizebasic) and [Ddsv6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/general-purpose/ddsv6-series?tabs=sizebasic)-series pages for all Dv6 VM sizes and specifications.\n\n| **VM Family** | **Size** | **vCPU** | **Memory (GiB)** | **Local Disk (GiB)** | **Max Data Disks** | **Network Gbps** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Dsv6-Series | Standard\\_D192s\\_v6 | 192 | 768 | N/A | 64 | 82 | | Ddsv6-Series | Standard\\_D192ds\\_v6 | 192 | 768 | 6x1760 | 64 | 82 |\n\n##### **Regional Availability**\n\nThe D192 VM sizes are broadly available in the following Azure regions: Southeast Asia, Australia East, USGov Virginia, Brazil South, Canada Central, China North 3, North Europe, West Europe, France Central, Germany West Central, Central India, Israel Central, Italy North, Japan East, Korea Central, Norway East, Poland Central, South Africa North, Spain Central, Sweden Central, Switzerland North, Taiwan North, UAE North, UK South, Central US, East US, East US 2, North Central US, West US, West US 2, West US 3.\n\nFor the most up-to-date region availability, refer to the Dsv6-series and Ddsv6-series rows in the [Product Availability by Region](https://aka.ms/FXv2-series_ProductByRegion).\n\n##### **Pricing**\n\nTo learn more about the Dsv6 and Ddsv6-Series VM pricing, please visit the [Azure Virtual Machines pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines). To learn more about remote disk types such as Standard SSD, Standard HDD, Premium SSD (v1), Premium SSD v2 and Ultra Disk storage please refer to [Azure managed disk type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types).\n\n##### **Getting Started**\n\nThe sizes are now available on Azure Portal in available regions.\n\nLearn more about the Azure Dsv6, Ddsv6, Dlsv6, Dldsv6, Esv6, and Edsv6 VMs here: [Announcing General Availability of Azure Dl/D/E v6 VMs powered by Intel EMR processor & Azure Boost | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-general-availability-of-azure-dlde-v6-vms-powered-by-intel-emr-proces/4376186)",
