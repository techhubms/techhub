This approach allows each connector—whether it's for data access, messaging, or workflow orchestration—to act as a specialized capability within the MCP framework. By dynamically composing these tools into Logic Apps, developers can rapidly construct agents that are both scalable and adaptable to complex enterprise scenarios. The benefits include reduced development overhead, enhanced reusability, and a streamlined path to integrating diverse systems—all while maintaining the flexibility and power of the Logic Apps platform.\n\nStarting today, we now support creating Logic Apps MCP Servers in the following ways:\n\n## **Registering Logic Apps connectors as MCP servers using Azure API Center**\n\nUsing this approach provides a streamlined experience when building MCP servers based upon Azure Logic Apps connectors. This new experience includes selecting a managed connector and one or more of its actions to create an MCP server and its related tools. This experience also automates the creation of Logic Apps workflows and wires up Easy Auth authentication for you in a matter of minutes.\n\nBeyond the streamlined experience that we provide, customers also benefit from any MCP server created using this experience to be registered within their API Center enterprise catalogue. For admins this means they can manage their MCP servers across the enterprise. For developers, it offers a centralized catalog where MCP servers can be discovered and quickly onboarded in Agent solutions.\n\nA walkthrough of creating an MCP server using API Center.\n\nTo get started, please refer to our [**product documentation**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/create-mcp-server-api-center) or our [**demo videos**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/logic-apps---mcp-demos/4452175).\n\n## **Enabling Logic Apps as remote MCP server**\n\nFor customers who have existing Logic Apps (Standard) investments or who want additional control over how their MCP tools are created we are also offering the ability to enable a Logic App as an MCP server. For a Logic App to be eligible to become an MCP server, it must have the following characteristics:\n\n- - One or more workflows that have an HTTP Request trigger and a corresponding HTTP Response action\n- It is recommended that your trigger has a description and your request payload has schema that includes meaningful descriptions\n- Your host.json file has been configured to enable MCP capabilities\n- You have created an App registration in Microsoft Entra and have configured Easy Auth in your Logic App\n\nTo get started, please refer to our [**product documentation**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/set-up-model-context-protocol-server-standard) or our [**demo videos**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/logic-apps---mcp-demos/4452175).\n\n### Feedback\n\nBoth of these capabilities are now available, in public preview, worldwide. If you have any questions or feedback on these MCP capabilities, we would love to hear from you.
