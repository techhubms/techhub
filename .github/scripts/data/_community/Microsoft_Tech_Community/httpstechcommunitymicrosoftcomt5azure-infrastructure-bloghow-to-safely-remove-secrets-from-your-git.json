The real challenge isn’t fixing the code — it’s cleaning the history.\n\nThis post walks through how to **safely and permanently remove sensitive data from your Git history.**\n\n## Why It’s Dangerous\n\nWhen secrets — such as API keys, SSH private keys, OAuth tokens, or database credentials — are committed to a public or even private Git repository, the risks are serious:\n\n- **Security breaches:** Attackers can replay commit history to extract secrets.\n- **Permanent exposure:** Even if the file is deleted, it remains in Git history and GitHub forks/caches.\n- **Automation risk:** Compromised tokens can trigger, pipelines.\n\nDeleting the file isn’t enough. You must **rewrite Git history** to remove it completely.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide: Remove Secrets Using git filter-repo\n\n**Warning:** History rewriting is **destructive**. Always create a backup or clone before proceeding. Coordinate with your team as everyone will need to re clone the repository after cleanup.\n\n### Step 1. Create a Safety Backup\n\nBefore touching your Git history, make a full backup. This gives you a restore point if anything goes wrong.\n\n``` git clone https://github.com/org/repo.git repo-backup ```\n\nOr download a ZIP snapshot from GitHub’s “Code → Download ZIP” menu.\n\n**Tip:** Don’t skip this step. Once you rewrite history, the old commit hashes are gone forever.\n\n### Step 2. Prepare a Clean Mirror for Rewriting\n\nYou’ll use a mirror clone — a minimal, metadata-rich copy of your repository — ideal for surgical operations.\n\n``` git clone --mirror https://github.com/org/repo.git repo-clean.git cd repo-clean.git ```\n\n### Step 3. Install git-filter-repo\n\n[git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) is the modern, fast, and officially recommended tool for rewriting Git history (it replaces the older git filter-branch).\n\n#### Install:\n\n``` brew install git-filter-repo # macOS pip install git-filter-repo # Cross-platform ```\n\n### Step 4. Use git-filter-repo to Remove Secrets\n\nNow, remove the sensitive file from every commit in your repository’s history.\n\n``` git filter-repo --path \"config/secrets.json\" --invert-paths ```\n\nIf you’ve exposed multiple files, include each path:\n\n``` git filter-repo --invert-paths --path \".env\" --path \"settings.py\" ```\n\n**Why this works:** The --invert-paths flag deletes the file (or files) from every commit, ensuring no historical trace remains.\n\n### Step 5. Verify Remote Configuration\n\nCheck your repository’s remote URL — sometimes it’s lost during history rewriting.\n\n``` git remote -v ```\n\nIf missing, re-add it:\n\n``` git remote set-url origin https://github.com/org/repo.git ```\n\n### Step 6. Push the Clean History Back\n\nReplace your remote history with the cleaned version.\n\n``` git push --force --all git push --force --tags ```\n\nAll existing collaborators will need to re-sync their clones. Communicate clearly before pushing.\n\n### Step 7. Refresh Your Local Clones\n\nEvery developer using this repo must re-sync after history rewriting.\n\n``` cd repo git fetch origin git reset --hard origin/main ```\n\n**Tip:** Never merge after a forced history rewrite — always hard reset to the updated branch.\n\n### Step 8. Verify That Secrets Are Gone\n\nConfirm that no old commits still contain the sensitive file:\n\n``` git log --all -- config/secrets.json ```\n\nIf it returns nothing, you’re clear. You can now safely delete the mirror repo:\n\n``` rm -rf repo-clean.git ```\n\n## Final Thoughts and Key Takeaways\n\nRewriting Git history may feel risky, but git filter-repo makes it clean, fast, and reliable. It’s the simplest way to erase secrets for good and prevent long-term security exposure. That said — once a secret’s been committed, **assume it’s compromised**. Rotate it right away and revoke any old tokens or credentials.\n\n1. Rotate exposed keys immediately.\n2. Add. env and config files to .gitignore.\n3. Use secret scanning to catch issues early.\n4. Notify your team before force-pushing.\n\nUpdated Oct 28, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[!\\[Sakshi_Gupta22&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-10.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/sakshi_gupta22/2838885) [Sakshi_Gupta22](/users/sakshi_gupta22/2838885) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined December 27, 2024\n\n[View Profile](/users/sakshi_gupta22/2838885)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azureinfrastructureblog [Azure Infrastructure Blog](/category/azure/blog/azureinfrastructureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
