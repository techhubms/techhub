I dont want to pay a yearly subscription for office and want to buy a single payment version of office or even just Word. Trouble is that Microsoft keep directing me to the full 365 subscription version. Do I have to uninstall the trial version of 365 first? I'm not sure how to get the version I want. Help!!",
