  "Description": "**In this issue:**\n\n- Ace Aviator of the Month\n- News from our product group\n- News from our community\n\n# Ace Aviator of the Month\n\n**Novembers’s Ace Aviator: Al Ghoniem**\n\n![]()Al Ghoniem - Senior Integration Consultant @ARINCO\n\n##### What's your role and title? What are your responsibilities?\n\nAs a Senior Integration Consultant, I design and deliver enterprise-grade integration on Microsoft Azure, primarily using Logic Apps Standard, API Management, Service Bus, Event Grid and Azure Functions. My remit covers reference architectures, “golden” templates, governance and FinOps guardrails, CI/CD automation (Bicep and YAML), and production-ready patterns for reliability, observability and cost efficiency.\n\nAlongside my technical work, I lead teams of consultants and engineers, helping them adopt standardised delivery models, mentor through code reviews and architectural walkthroughs, and ensure we deliver consistent, high-quality outcomes across projects. I also help teams apply decisioning patterns (embedded versus external rules) and integrate AI responsibly within enterprise workflows.\n\nCan you give us some insights into your day-to-day activities and what a typical day in your role looks like?\n\n- **Architecture and patterns:** refining solution designs, sequence diagrams and rules models for new and existing integrations.\n- **Build and automation:** evolving reusable Logic App Standard templates, Bicep modules and pipelines, embedding monitoring, alerts and identity-first security.\n- **Problem-solving:** addressing performance tuning, transient fault handling, poison/DLQ flows and “design for reprocessing.”\n- **Leadership and enablement:** mentoring consultants, facilitating technical discussions, and ensuring knowledge is shared across teams.\n- **Community and writing:** publishing articles and examples to demystify real-world integration trade-offs.\n\n##### What motivates and inspires you to be an active member of the Aviators/Microsoft community?\n\nThe community continuously turns hard-won lessons into reusable practices. Sharing patterns (and anti-patterns) saves others time and incidents, while learning from peers strengthens my own work. Microsoft’s product teams also listen closely, and seeing customer feedback directly shape the platform is genuinely rewarding.\n\n##### Looking back, what advice do you wish you had been given earlier that you'd now share with those looking to get into STEM/technology?\n\n- **Optimise for learning speed, not titles**. Choose problems that stretch you and deliver in small, measurable increments.\n- **Master the fundamentals.** Naming, idempotency, retries and observability are not glamorous but make systems dependable.\n- **Document everything.** Diagrams, runbooks and ADRs multiply your impact.\n- **Understand trade-offs.** Every decision buys something and costs something; acknowledge both sides clearly.\n- **Value collaboration over heroics.** Ask questions, share knowledge and give credit freely.\n\n##### What has helped you grow professionally?\n\n- **Reusable scaffolding:** creating golden templates and reference repositories that capture best practice once and reuse it everywhere.\n- **Feedback loops:** leveraging telemetry, post-incident reviews and peer critique to improve.\n- **Teaching and mentoring:** explaining concepts to others brings clarity and strengthens leadership.\n- **Cross-disciplinary curiosity:** combining architecture, DevOps, FinOps and AI to address problems holistically.\n\n##### If you had a magic wand that could create a feature in Logic Apps, what would it be and why?\n\n\"Stateful Sessions and Decisions” as a first-class capability:\n\n- **Built-in session state** across multiple workflows, durable correlation and resumable orchestrations without external storage.\n- **A native decisioning activity** with versioned decision tables and rule auditing (“why this rule fired”).\n- **A local-first developer experience** with fast testing and contract validation for confident iteration.\n\nThis would simplify complex, human-in-the-loop and event-driven scenarios, reduce custom plumbing, and make advanced orchestration patterns accessible to a wider audience.\n\n# News from our product group\n\n| ![]() | [Logic Apps Community Day 2025](https://aka.ms/lacommunityday25)<br><br><br>Did you miss or want to catch up again on your favorite Logic Apps Community Day videos – jump back into action on this four hours long learning session, with 10 sessions from our Community Experts.
