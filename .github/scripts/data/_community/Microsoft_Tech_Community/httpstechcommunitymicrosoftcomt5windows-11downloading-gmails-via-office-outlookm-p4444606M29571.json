I want/need to leave the messages in the gmail server as back up and delete them manually (much) later -- but the sign up to completing the Office Suite software wants me to agree that the emails on the server will be deleted automatically as I refresh my email Inbox? Am I reading this right and how can I get access to Office without losing messages off the server? I also resist the synching across my other 2 devices (iPadand iPhone) as I use devices for different activities and need to save or delete messages differently across the devices. But vitally I welcome advice on the auto deletion issue as I am having to stick with web use of email meanwhile which is awkward given I need the extras of Office Thank you",
