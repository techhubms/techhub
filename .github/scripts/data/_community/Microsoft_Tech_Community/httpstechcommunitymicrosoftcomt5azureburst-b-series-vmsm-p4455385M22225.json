  "Description": "Hi everyone,\n\nin Cost Management reports I see a line item called “Windows Server Burst” associated with B-Series VMs.\n\nI’ve been trying to understand this for a while, but I haven’t been able to find any official Microsoft documentation that clearly explains what this charge covers.\n\nMy assumption is that it refers to the Windows Server license cost for burstable VMs, and not an additional variable charge when the CPU actually goes into burst mode but I’d like to confirm.\n\nHas anyone found an official Microsoft reference or can provide clarification?\n\nThanks a lot!",
