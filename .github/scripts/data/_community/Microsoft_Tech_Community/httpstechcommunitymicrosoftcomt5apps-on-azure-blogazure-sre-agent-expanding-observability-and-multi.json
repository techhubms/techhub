  "EnhancedContent": "The Azure SRE Agent continues to evolve as a cornerstone for operational excellence and incident management. Over the past few months, we have made significant strides in enabling integrations with leading observability platforms—[Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/boost-cloud-reliability-dynatrace-and-azure-sre-agent-unite-for-autonomous-operations/), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/microsoft-ignite-2025-agentic-ai-integrations), and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)—through Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers. These partnerships serve joint customers, enabling automated remediation across diverse environments.\n\n#### Deepening Integrations with MCP Servers\n\nOur collaboration with these partners is more than technical—it’s about delivering value at scale. Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace are all Azure Native ISV Service partners. With these integrations Azure Native customers can also choose to add these MCP servers directly from the Azure Native partners’ resource:\n\n- Datadog: At Ignite, Azure SRE Agent was presented with the Datadog MCP Server, to demonstrate how our customers can streamline complex workflows.  Customers can now bring their Datadog MCP Server into Azure SRE Agent, extending knowledge capabilities and centralizing logs and metrics. Find Datadog Azure Native offerings on [Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/product/saas/datadog1591740804488.dd_liftr_v2?tab=Overview).\n\n- New Relic: When an alert fires in New Relic, the Azure SRE Agent calls the New Relic MCP Server to provide Intelligent Observability insights. This agentic integration with the New Relic MCP Server offers over 35 specialized tools across, entity and account management, alerts and monitoring, data analysis and queries, performance analysis, and much more. The advanced remediation skills of the Azure SRE Agent + New Relic AI help our joint customers diagnose and resolve production issues faster. Find New Relic’s Azure Native offering on [Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/product/saas/newrelicinc1635200720692.newrelic_liftr_payg?tab=Overview)\n\n- Dynatrace: The Dynatrace integration bridges Microsoft Azure's cloud-native infrastructure management with Dynatrace's AI-powered observability platform, leveraging the Davis AI engine and remote MCP server capabilities for incident detection, root cause analysis, and remediation across hybrid cloud environments. Check out Dynatrace’s Azure Native offering on [Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-US/product/saas/dynatrace.dynatrace_portal_integration?tab=Overview).\n\nThese integrations are made possible by Azure SRE Agent’s MCP connectors. The MCP connectors in Azure SRE Agent act as the bridge between the agent and MCP servers, enabling dynamic discovery and execution of specialized tools for observability and incident management across diverse environments. This feature allows customers to build their own custom sub-agents to leverage tools from MCP Servers from integrated platforms like Dynatrace, Datadog, and New Relic to complement the agent’s diagnostic and remediation capabilities. By connecting Azure SRE Agent to external MCP servers scenarios such as cross-platform telemetry analysis are unlocked.\n\n#### Looking Ahead: Multi-Agent Collaboration\n\nAzure SRE Agent isn’t stopping with MCP integrations We’re actively working with [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) and [NeuBird](https://neubird.ai/blog/neubird-azure-sre-agentic-collaboration/) to support dynamic use cases via agent-to-agent collaboration:\n\n- PagerDuty: PagerDuty’s PD Advance SRE Agent is an AI-powered assistant that triages incidents by analyzing logs, diagnostics, past incident history, and runbooks to surface relevant context and recommended remediations. At Ignite, PagerDuty and Microsoft demonstrated how Azure SRE Agent can ingest PagerDuty incidents and collaborate with PagerDuty’s SRE Agent to complement triage using historical patterns, runbook intelligence and Azure diagnostics.\n\n- NeuBird: NeuBird’s Agentic AI SRE, Hawkeye, autonomously investigates and resolves incidents across hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. By connecting to telemetry sources like Azure Monitor, Prometheus, and GitHub, Hawkeye delivers real-time diagnosis and targeted fixes. Building on the work presented at [SRE Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2JKQX6haYc) this partnership underscores our commitment to agentic ecosystems where specialized agents collaborate for complex scenarios. Sign up for the private preview to try the integration, [here](https://neubird.ai/neubird-x-microsoft-azure-ai-sre-private-preview/). Additionally, please check out NeuBird on [Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/saas/neubirdinc1733351251104.hawkeye).\n\nThese efforts reflect a broader vision: Azure SRE Agent as a hub for cross-platform reliability, enabling customers to manage incidents across Azure, on-premises, and other clouds with confidence.\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nAs organizations embrace distributed architectures, the need for integrated, intelligent, and multi-cloud-ready SRE solutions has never been greater. By partnering with industry leaders and pioneering agent-to-agent workflows, Azure SRE Agent is setting the stage for a future where resilience is not just reactive—it’s proactive and collaborative.\n\nUpdated Nov 24, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure paas](/tag/azure%20paas?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[best practices](/tag/best%20practices?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[devops](/tag/devops?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[modern apps](/tag/modern%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[dbandaru&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xODc2Mjc5LTU4NDM2OWk2MjcxQjY2RTZCMEQzMDkw?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/dbandaru/1876279) [dbandaru](/users/dbandaru/1876279) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined May 24, 2023\n\n[View Profile](/users/dbandaru/1876279)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
