I still roam around both windows 11 and Windows 10.\n\nI have noticed, over the past weeks, that there is a marked drop in help requests in Windows 11, in spite of the initial gigantic surge. Even a l forum, normally frantically active, has little related to problems on Windows11, just load of associated drivel. Is it possible that MS got it right? With the large number of correcting updates coming in on a regular basis, I view the OS as having been released too early - maybe because of pressure from the overlarge insider subscribers. It is ok, for me anyway, but not remarkable. Just me venting.",
