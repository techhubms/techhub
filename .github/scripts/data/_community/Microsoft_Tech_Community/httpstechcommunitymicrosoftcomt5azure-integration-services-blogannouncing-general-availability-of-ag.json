Thousands of customers—from innovative startups to Fortune 500 enterprises—have embraced Agent Loop, **building thousands of active agents that have collectively processed billions of tokens every month for the past six months**. The growth of agents, executions, and token usage has accelerated significantly, doubling month over month. Since the launch of Conversational Agents in September, they already account for nearly 30% of all agentic workflows. Across the platform, agentic workflows now consume billions of tokens, with overall token usage increasing at nearly 3× month over month.\n\n#### Cyderes: 5X Faster Security Investigation Cycles\n\nCyderes leveraged Agent Loop to automate triage and handling of security alerts, leading to faster investigation cycles and significant cost savings.\n\n> >\n> \"*We were drowning in data—processing over 10,000 alerts daily while analysts spent more time chasing noise than connecting narratives.

These applications drive impact across a wide range of scenarios:\n\n- Developer Productivity: Write code, generate unit tests, create workflows, map data between systems, automate source control, deployment and release pipelines\n- IT Operations: Incident management, ticket and issue handling, policy review and enforcement, triage, resource management, cost optimization, issue remediation\n- Business Process Automation: Empower sales specialists, retail assistants, order processing/approval flows, and healthcare assistants for intake and scheduling\n- Customer & Stakeholder Support: Project planning and estimation, content generation, automated communication, and streamlined customer service workflows\n\n## Proven Internally at Microsoft\n\nAgent Loop is also powering Microsoft and Logic Apps team's own operations, demonstrating its versatility and real-world impact:\n\n- IcM Automation Team: Transforming Microsoft's internal incident automation platform into an agent studio that leverages Logic Apps' Agent Loop, enabling teams across Microsoft to build agentic live site incident automations\n- Logic Apps Team Use Cases:\n- Release & Deployment Agent: Streamlines deployment and release management for the Logic Apps platform\n- Incident Management Agent: An extension of our SRE Agent, leveraging Agent Loop to accelerate incident response and remediation\n- Analyst Agent: Assists teams in exploring product usage and health data, generating insights directly from analytics\n\n## What's Generally Available Today\n\n**Core Agent Loop Capabilities (GA)**\n\n- Agent Loop in Logic Apps Standard SKU - Support for both Autonomous and Conversational workflows\n- *Autonomous workflows* run agents automatically based on triggers and conditions\n- *Conversational workflows* use A2A to enable interactive chat experiences with agents\n- On-Behalf-Of Authentication - Per-user authentication for 1st-party and 3rd-party connectors\n- Agent Hand-Off - Enable seamless collaboration in multi-agent workflows\n- Python Code Interpreter - Execute Python code dynamically for data analysis and computation\n- Nested Agent Action - Use agents as tools within other agents for sophisticated orchestration\n- User ACLs Support - Fine-grained document access control for knowledge\n\n### Exciting New Agent Loop Features in Public Preview\n\nWe've also released several groundbreaking features in Public Preview:\n\n- New Designer Experience - Redesigned interface optimized for building agentic workflows\n- Agent Loop in Consumption SKU - Deploy agents in the serverless Consumption tier\n- MCP Support - Integrate Model Context Protocol servers as tools, enabling agents to access standardized tool ecosystems\n- AI Gateway Integration - Use Azure AI Gateway as a model source for unified governance and monitoring\n- Teams/M365 Deployment - Deploy conversational agents directly in Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365\n- Okta Identity Provider - Use Okta as the identity provider for conversational agents\n\n**Here’s our [Announcement Blog](https://aka.ms/agentloop/igniteupdate) for these new capabilities**\n\n## Built on a Platform You Already Trust\n\nAzure Logic Apps is already a proven iPaaS platform with thousands of customers using it for automation – ranging from startups to 100% of Fortune 500 companies. Agent Loop doesn't create a separate \"agentic workflow automation platform\" you have to learn and operate. Instead, it makes Azure Logic Apps itself your agentic platform:\n\n- Workflows orchestrate triggers, approvals, retries, and branching\n- Agent Loop, powered by LLMs, handle reasoning, planning, and tool selection\n- Humans stay in control through approvals, exceptions, and guided hand-offs\n\nAgent Loop runs inside your Logic Apps Standard environment, so you get the same benefits you already know: enterprise SLAs, VNET integration, data residency controls, hybrid hosting options, and integration with your existing deployment pipelines and governance model.\n\n## Enterprise Ready - Secure, User-Aware Agents by Design\n\nBringing agents into the enterprise only works if security and compliance are first-class. With Agent Loop in Azure Logic Apps, security is built into every layer of the stack.\n\n**Per-User Actions with On-Behalf-Of (OBO) and Delegated Permissions**\n\nMany agent scenarios require tools to act in the context of the signed-in user. Agent Loop supports the OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow so that supported connector actions can run with delegated, per-user connections rather than a broad app-only identity.\n\nThat means when an agent sends mail, reads SharePoint, or updates a service desk system, it does so as the user (where supported), respecting that user's licenses, permissions, and data boundaries. This is critical for scenarios like IT operations, HR requests, and finance approvals where \"who did what\" must be auditable.\n\n**Document-Level Security with Microsoft Entra-Based Access Control**\n\nAgents should only see the content a user is entitled to see. With Azure AI Search's Entra-based document-level security, your retrieval-augmented workflows can enforce ACLs and RBAC directly in the index so that queries are automatically trimmed to documents the user has access to.\n\n**Secured Chat Entry Point with Easy Auth and Entra ID**\n\nThe built-in chat client and your custom clients can be protected using App Service Authentication (Easy Auth) and Microsoft Entra ID, so only authorized users and apps can invoke your conversational endpoints.\n\nTogether, OBO, document-level security, and Easy Auth give you end-to-end identity and access control—from the chat surface, through the agent, down to your data and systems.\n\n## An Open Toolbox: Connectors, Workflows, MCP Servers, and External Agents\n\nAgent Loop inherits the full power of the Logic Apps ecosystem and more -\n\n- 1,400+ connectors for SaaS, on-premises, and custom APIs\n- Workflows and agents as tools - compose sophisticated multi-step capabilities\n- MCP server support - integrate with the Model Context Protocol for standardized tool access (Preview)\n- A2A protocol support - enable agent-to-agent communication across platforms\n- Multi-model flexibility - use Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry hosted models, or bring your own model on any endpoint via AI gateway\n\nYou're not locked into a single vendor or model provider. Agent Loop gives you an open, extensible framework that works with your existing investments and lets you choose the right tools for each job.\n\n## Run Agents Wherever You Run Logic Apps\n\nAgent Loop is native to Logic Apps Standard, so your agentic workflows run consistently across cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments. They inherit the same deployment, scaling, and networking capabilities as your workflows, bringing adaptive, AI-driven automation to wherever your systems and data live.\n\n## Getting Started with Agent Loop\n\nWe're in very exciting times, and we can't wait to see our customers go to production and realize the benefits of these capabilities for their business outcomes and success.
