  "Description": "An FYI for those of you using Teams Phone:\n\nWe recently learned, due to customer complaints, that Microsoft is rolling out an update to the \"voicemail bot\" in Microsoft Teams Phone that takes personal voicemail messages. This new version of the bot has removed the ability for customers to press 0 to follow the configured opt-out (transfer) option for the mailbox (i.e. operator, call queue, etc). Pressing zero is ignored and does not interrupt the greeting.\n\nI'm specifically referring to setting VoicemailWithTransferOption with an associated TransferTarget.\n\nWe see this as a customer service disaster that is not aligned with industry conventions or customer service best practice. We have pushed back strongly on Microsoft's decision making but they say that only a handful of customers have complained.\n\nThis new bot is 70% rolled out to tenants as we speak. Microsoft customer support has associated our tenants to the \"old bot\" for the time being, but saying they are unsure how long they can maintain this as the rollout continues.",
