  "Description": "## Empowering intelligent applications\n\nThe next wave of AI is agentic – systems that can reason, plan, and act on our behalf. Whether you’re building a virtual assistant that books travel or a multi‑model workflow that triages support tickets, these applications rely on multiple models, tools, and services working together. Unfortunately, building them has not been easy:\n\n- Tooling sprawl. Developers must wire together LLMs, vector databases, MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools and orchestration logic, often across disparate SDKs and running processes. Keeping those dependencies in sync for local development and production is tedious and error‑prone.\n- Specialized hardware. Large language models and agent orchestration frameworks often require GPUs to run effectively. Procuring and managing GPU instances can be costly, particularly for prototypes and small teams.\n- Operational complexity. Agentic applications are typically composed of many services. Scaling them, managing health and secure connectivity, and reproducing the same environment from a developer laptop into production quickly becomes a full‑time job.\n\n![]()\n\n## Why Azure Container Apps is the right home\n\nWith Azure Container Apps (ACA), you can now tackle these challenges without sacrificing the familiar Docker Compose workflow that so many developers love. We’re excited to announce that Compose for Agents is in public preview on Azure Container Apps. This integration brings the power of Docker’s new agentic tooling to a platform that was built for serverless containers.\n\nHere’s why ACA is the natural home for agentic workloads:\n\n- **Serverless GPUs with per‑second billing.** Container Apps offers serverless GPU compute. Your agentic workloads can run on GPUs only when they need to, and you only pay for the seconds your container is actually running. This makes it economical to prototype and scale complex models without upfront infrastructure commitments. Media reports on the preview note that Docker’s Offload service uses remote GPUs via cloud providers such as Microsoft to overcome local hardware limits, and ACA brings that capability directly into the Azure native experience.\n\n- **Sandboxed dynamic sessions for tools.** Many agentic frameworks execute user‑provided code as part of their workflows. ACA’s dynamic sessions provide secure, short‑lived sandboxes for running these tasks. This means untrusted or transient code (for example, evaluation scripts or third‑party plugins) runs in an isolated environment, keeping your production services safe.\n\n- **Fully managed scaling and operations.** Container Apps automatically scales each service based on traffic and queue length, and it can scale down to zero when idle. You get built‑in service discovery, ingress, rolling updates and revision management without having to operate your own orchestrator. Developers can focus on building agents rather than patching servers.\n\n- **First‑class Docker Compose support.** Compose remains a favourite tool for developers’ inner loop and for orchestrating multi‑container systems. Compose for Agents extends the format to declare open‑source models, agents and tools alongside your microservices. By pointing docker compose up at ACA, the same YAML file you use locally now deploys automatically to a fully managed container environment.\n\n- **Model Runner and MCP Gateway built in.** Docker’s Model Runner lets you pull open‑weight language models from Docker Hub and exposes them via OpenAI‑compatible endpoints, and the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Gateway connects your agents to curated tools. ACA integrates these components into your Compose stack, giving you everything you need for retrieval‑augmented generation, vector search or domain‑specific tool invocation.\n\n## What this means for developers\n\nThe Compose for Agents public preview on Container Apps brings together the simplicity of Docker Compose and the operational power of Azure’s serverless compute platform. Developers can now:\n\n- Define agent stacks declaratively. Instead of cobbling together scripts, you describe your entire agentic application in a single compose.yaml file. Compose already supports popular frameworks like LangGraph, Embabel, Vercel AI SDK, Spring AI, Crew AI, Google ADK and Agno. You can mix and match these frameworks with your own microservices, databases and queues.\n\n- Run anywhere with the same configuration. Docker emphasizes that you can “define your open models, agents and MCP‑compatible tools, then spin up your full agentic stack with a simple docker compose up”. By bringing this workflow to ACA, Microsoft ensures that the same compose file runs unchanged on your laptop and in the cloud.\n\n- Scale seamlessly. Large language models and multi‑agent orchestration can be compute‑intensive. News coverage notes that Docker’s Offload service provides remote GPUs for these workloads ACA extends that capability with serverless GPUs and automated scaling, letting you test locally and then burst to the cloud with no changes to your YAML.\n\n## Collaboration with Docker\n\nThis preview is the result of close collaboration between Microsoft and Docker. A Docker has always been focused on simplifying complex developer workflows. **“****With Compose for Agents, we’re** **extending that same experience that developers know and love from containers to agents, bringing the power of Compose to the emerging world of AI-native, agentic applications. It delivers the same simplicity and predictability to prototyping, testing, and deploying across local and cloud environments”** said Elyi Aleyner, VP of Strategy and Head of Tech Alliances at Docker. “We’re excited to partner with Microsoft to bring this innovation to Azure Container Apps, enabling developers to go from ‘compose up’ on their laptops to secure, GPU-backed workloads in the cloud with zero friction.”\n\n## Empowering choice\n\nEvery team has its own favourite frameworks and tools. We’ve ensured that Compose for Agents on ACA is framework‑agnostic: you can use LangGraph for complex workflows, CrewAI for multi‑agent coordination, or Spring AI to integrate with your existing Java stack. Want to run a vector store from the MCP catalog alongside your own service? Simply add it to your Compose file. Docker’s curated catalog provides over a hundred ready‑to‑use tools and services for retrieval, document summarization, database access and more. ACA’s flexibility means you’re free to choose the stack that best fits your problem.\n\n## Get started today\n\nThe public preview of Compose for Agents support in Azure Container Apps is available now. You can:\n\n1. Install the latest Azure Container Apps Extension\n2. Define your application in a compose.yaml file, including models, tools and agent code and deploy to ACA via **az containerapp compose up.** ACA will provision GPU resources, dynamic sessions and auto‑scaling infrastructure automatically.\n3. Iterate locally using standard docker compose up commands, then push the same configuration to the cloud when you’re ready.\n\n##### For more detailed instructions please go to **[https://aka.ms/aca/compose-for-agents](https://aka.ms/aca/compose-for-agents)**",
