  "EnhancedContent": "**Sachin Sheth** - Principal PDM Manager\n\n**Brian Barbisch** - Principal Group Software Engineering Manager\n\n**Matt White** - Principal Group Software Engineering Manager\n\n**Brian Lepore** - Principal Product Manager\n\n**Wolfgang De Salvador** - Senior Product Manager\n\n**Ron Hogue** - Senior Product Manager\n\n#### Introduction\n\nWe are excited to announce the Public Preview of AMLFS Durable Premium 20 (AMLFS 20), a new SKU in Azure Managed Lustre designed to deliver unprecedented performance and scale for demanding AI and HPC workloads.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Massive Scale:******Store up to 25 PiB of data in a single namespace, with up to 512 GB/s of total bandwidth.\n\n- **Advanced Metadata Performance:******Multi-MDS (Metadata Server) architecture dramatically improves metadata IOPS. In *mdtest* benchmarks, AMLFS 20 demonstrated more than 5x improvement in metadata operations. An additional MDS is provided for every 5 PiB of provisioned filesystem.\n\n- **High File Capacity:******Supports up to 20 billion inodes for maximum namespace size.\n\n#### Why AMLFS 20 Matters\n\n- **Simplified Architecture:** Previously, datasets larger than 12.5 PiB required multiple filesystems and complex management. AMLFS 20 enables a single, high-performance file system for massive AI and HPC workloads up to 25 PiB, streamlining deployment and administration.\n\n- **Accelerated Data Preparation:** The multi-MDT architecture significantly increases metadata IOPS, which is crucial during the data preparation stage of AI training, where rapid access to millions of files is required.\n\n- **Faster Time-to-Value:** Researchers and engineers benefit from easier management, reduced bottlenecks, and faster access to large datasets, accelerating innovation.\n\n#### Availability\n\nAMLFS 20 is available in Public Preview alongside the already existing AMLFS SKUs. For more details on other SKUs, visit the [Azure Managed Lustre documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-managed-lustre/create-file-system-portal#throughput-configurations).\n\n#### How to Join the Preview\n\nIf you are working with large-scale AI or HPC workloads and would like early access to AMLFS 20, we invite you to [fill out this form](https://aka.ms/AMLFS20PreviewForm) to tell us about your use case.
