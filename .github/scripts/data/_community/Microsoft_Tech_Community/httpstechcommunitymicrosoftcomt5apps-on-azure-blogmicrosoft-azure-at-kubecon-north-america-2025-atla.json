  "Title": "Microsoft Azure at KubeCon North America 2025 | Atlanta, GA - Nov 10-13",
  "Description": "KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America is back - this time in Atlanta, Georgia, and the excitement is real. Whether you‚Äôre a developer, operator, architect, or just Kubernetes-curious, Microsoft Azure is showing up with a packed agenda, hands-on demos, and plenty of ways to connect and learn with our team of experts. Read on for all the ways you can connect with our team!\n\n### Kick off with Azure Day with Kubernetes (Nov 10)\n\n![]()\n\nBefore the main conference even starts, join us for **Azure Day with Kubernetes** on November 10. It‚Äôs a full day of learning, best practices, deep-dive discussions, and hands-on labs, all designed to help you build cloud-native and AI apps with Kubernetes on Azure. You‚Äôll get to meet Microsoft experts, dive into technical sessions, roll up your sleeves in the afternoon labs or have focused deep-dive discussions in our whiteboarding sessions. If you‚Äôre looking to sharpen your skills or just want to chat with folks who live and breathe Kubernetes on Azure, this is the place to be.\n\n**Spots are limited**, so register today at: [https://aka.ms/AzureKubernetesDay](https://aka.ms/AzureKubernetesDay)\n\n### Catch up with our experts at Booth #500\n\nThe Microsoft booth is more than just a spot to grab swag (though, yes, there will be swag and stickers!). It‚Äôs a central hub for connecting with product teams, setting up meetings, and seeing live demos. Whether you want to learn how to troubleshoot Kubernetes with agentic AI tools, explore open-source projects, or just talk shop, you‚Äôll find plenty of friendly faces ready to help.\n\nWe will be running a variety of theatre sessions and demos out of the booth week on topics including AKS Automatic, agentic troubleshooting, Azure Verified Modules, networking, app modernization, hybrid deployments, storage, and more.\n\nüî•**Hot tip:** join us for our live Kubernetes Trivia Show at the Microsoft Azure booth during the KubeCrawl on Tuesday to win exclusive swag!\n\n## Microsoft sessions at KubeCon NA 2025\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick look at all the sessions with Microsoft speakers that you won‚Äôt want to miss.

While multicluster support offers benefits in terms of geographic redundancy, data sovereignty, and resource optimization, it also introduces significant challenges around orchestration, traffic routing, cost control, and operational overhead.<br><br>To address these challenges, we‚Äôll introduce two CNCF projects‚ÄîKAITO and KubeFleet‚Äîthat work together to simplify and optimize multicluster AI operations. KAITO provides a declarative framework for managing AI inference workflows with built-in support for model versioning, and performance telemetry. KubeFleet complements this by enabling seamless workload distribution across clusters, based on cost, latency, and availability. Together, these tools reduce operational complexity, improve cost efficiency, and ensure consistent performance at scale. | | --- | --- |\n\n| **Date:‚ÄØThu November 13, 2025**‚ÄØ <br><br><br><br>**Start Time:‚ÄØ9:56 AM** <br><br><br><br>**Room:‚ÄØExhibit Hall B2** | **Title:‚ÄØ[Cloud Native Back to the Future: The Road Ahead](https://sched.co/27dEs)** <br><br><br><br>**Speakers:**Jeremy Rickard (Microsoft), Alex Chircop (Akamai)<br><br><br><br>**Abstract:** The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) turns 10 this year, now home to more than 200 projects across the cloud native landscape. As we look ahead, the community faces new demands around security, sustainability, complexity, and emerging workloads like AI inference and agents. As many areas of the ecosystem transition to mature foundational building blocks, we are excited to explore the next evolution of cloud native development. The TOC will highlight how these challenges open opportunities to shape the next generation of applications and ensure the ecosystem continues to thrive.<br><br><br><br><br><ul><br><li>How are new projects addressing these new emerging workloads?</li><br><br><li>How will these new projects impact security hygiene in the ecosystem?</li><br><br><li>How will existing projects adapt to meet new realities?</li><br><br><li>How is the CNCF evolving to support this next generation of computing?<br><br></li><br><br></ul><br><br>Join us as we reflect on the first decade of cloud native‚Äîand look ahead to how this community will power the age of AI, intelligent systems, and beyond. | | --- | --- |\n\n#### **Featured Demo**\n\n| **Date:‚ÄØWed November 12, 2025** <br><br><br><br>**Start Time:‚ÄØ2:15-2:35 PM** <br><br><br><br>**Room:‚ÄØExpo Demo Area** | **Title:‚ÄØ[HolmesGPT: Agentic K8s troubleshooting in your terminal](https://sched.co/2A7EB)**<br><br><br><br>**Speakers:**Pavneet Singh Ahluwalia (Microsoft), Arik Alon (Robusta)<br><br><br><br>**Abstract:**Troubleshooting Kubernetes shouldn‚Äôt require hopping across dashboards, logs, and docs. With open-source tools like HolmesGPT and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, you can now bring an agentic experience directly into your CLI. In this demo, we‚Äôll show how this OSS stack can run everywhere, from lightweight kind clusters on your laptop to production-grade clusters at scale. The experience supports any LLM provider: in-cluster, local, or cloud, ensuring data never leaves your environment and costs remain predictable. We will showcase how users can ask natural-language questions (e.g., ‚Äúwhy is my pod Pending?‚Äù) and get grounded reasoning, targeted diagnostics, and safe, human-in-the-loop remediation steps -- all without leaving the terminal. Whether you‚Äôre experimenting locally or running mission-critical workloads, you‚Äôll walk away knowing how to extend these OSS components to build your own agentic workflows in Kubernetes. | | --- | --- |\n\n#### **All sessions**\n\n| **Microsoft Speaker(s)** | **Session** | | --- | --- | | Will Case | [No Kubectl, No Problem: The Future With Conversational Kubernetes](https://sched.co/27FXO) | | Ana Maria Lopez Moreno | [Smarter Together: Orchestrating Multi-Agent AI Systems With A2A and MCP on Container](https://sched.co/27FWc) | | Neha Aggarwal | [10 Years of Cilium: Connecting, Securing, and Simplifying the Cloud Native Stack](https://sched.co/27Nnr) | | Yi Zha | [Strengthening Supply Chain for Kubernetes: Cross-Cloud SLSA Attestation Verification](https://sched.co/27NlO) | | Joaquim Rocha & Oleksandr Dubenko | [Contribfest: Power up Your CNCF Tools With Headlamp](https://sched.co/27Nkr) | | Jeremy Rickard | [Shaping LTS Together: What We‚Äôve Learned the Hard Way](https://sched.co/27FWW) | | Feynman Zhou | [Shipping Secure, Reusable, and Composable Infrastructure as Code: GE HealthCare‚Äôs Journey With ORAS](https://sched.co/27FWZ) | | Jackie Maertens & Nilekh Chaudhari | [No Joke: Two Security Maintainers Walk Into a Cluster](https://sched.co/27FWr) | | Paul Yu, Sachi Desai | [Rage Against the Machine: Fighting AI Complexity with Kubernetes simplicity](https://sched.co/27FWo) | | Dipti Pai | [Flux - The GitLess GitOps Edition](https://sched.co/27NnQ) | | Trask Stalnaker | [OpenTelemetry: Unpacking 2025, Charting 2026](https://sched.co/27Y2M) | | Mike Morris | [Gateway API: Table Stakes](https://sched.co/27No3) | | Anish Ramasekar, Mo Khan, Stanislav L√°zniƒçka, Rita Zhang & Peter Engelbert | [Strengthening Kubernetes Trust: SIG Auth's Latest Security Enhancements](https://sched.co/27Nld) | | Ernest Wong | [AI Models Are Huge, but Your GPUs Aren‚Äôt: Mastering multi-mode distributed inference on Kubernetes](https://sched.co/27FdL) | | Rita Zhang | [Navigating the Rapid Evolution of Large Model Inference: Where does Kubernetes fit?](https://sched.co/27Nlv) | | Suraj Deshmukh | [LLMs on Kubernetes: Squeeze 5x GPU Efficiency with cache, route, repeat!](https://sched.co/27FcQ) | | Aman Singh | [Drasi: A New Take on Change-driven Architectures](https://sched.co/27FcB) | | Ganeshkumar Ashokavardhanan & Qinghui Zhuang | [Agent-Driven MCP for AI Workloads on Kubernetes](https://sched.co/27FYk) | | Steven Jin | [Contribfest: From Farm (Fork) To Table (Feature): Growing Your First (Free-range Organic) Istio PR](https://contribfest:%20from%20farm%20%28fork%29%20to%20table%20%28feature%29:%20Growing%20Your%20First%20%28Free-range%20Organic%29%20Istio%20PR/) | | Jack Francis | [SIG Autoscaling Projects Update](https://sched.co/27Nlg) | | Mark Rossetti | [Kubernetes SIG-Windows Updates](https://sched.co/27NoC) | | Apurup Chevuru & Michael Zappa | [Portable MTLS for Kubernetes: A QUIC-Based Plugin Compatible With Any CNI](https://sched.co/27FaL) | | Ciprian Hacman | [The Next Decoupling: From Monolithic Cluster, To Control-Plane With Nodes](https://sched.co/27Nlp) | | Keith Mattix | [Istio Project Updates: AI Inference, Ambient Multicluster & Default Deny](https://sched.co/27NoI) | | Jonathan Smith | [How Comcast Leverages Radius in Their Internal Developer Platform](https://sched.co/27Fbe) | | Jon Huhn | [Lightning Talk: Getting (and Staying) up To Speed on DRA With the DRA Example Driver](https://sched.co/27Fbq) | | Rita Zhang, Jaydip Gabani | [Open Policy Agent (OPA) Intro & Deep Dive](https://sched.co/27Nmw) | | Bridget Kromhout | [SIG Cloud Provider Deep Dive: Expanding Our Mission](https://sched.co/27NoX) | | Pavneet Ahluwalia | [Beyond ChatOps: Agentic AI in Kubernetes‚ÄîWhat Works, What Breaks, and What‚Äôs Next](https://sched.co/27Ff5) | | Ryan Zhang | [Finally, a Cluster Inventory I Can USE!](https://sched.co/27FfN) | | Michael Katchinskiy, Yossi Weizman | [You Deployed What?!
