  "Description": "## What’s new — Managed Prometheus now supports VMs & VMSS\n\nToday we are excited to announce the **private preview** of Azure Managed Prometheus support for virtual machines (VM) and virtual machine scale sets (VMSS). Until now, Managed Prometheus on Azure was primarily targeted at containerized workloads — e.g. Kubernetes (AKS) or Azure Arc–enabled clusters. With this preview, you can now extend Prometheus-style monitoring to your IaaS workloads running on VMs/VMSS, giving you unified, scalable, resilient metric collection and observability across both containers and traditional compute —including full support for **GPU and InfiniBand (IB)** metric collection for HPC scenarios.\n\nBehind the scenes, Azure Monitor provides the storage, ingestion pipeline, and query engine, while surfacing a fully compatible Prometheus experience — including scraping, PromQL, alerting rules, and dashboards.\n\n## Why this matters — especially for HPC workloads\n\nAzure HPC customers running large fleets of GPU-accelerated VMs and VMSS nodes can now:\n\n- Collect **node-level metrics** (CPU, memory, disk, frontend NIC, InfiniBand) and **GPU metrics** (utilization, memory, clocks, ECC, throttling) through standard Prometheus exporters\n- Store all Prometheus metrics in an [**Azure Monitor Workspace**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/metrics/azure-monitor-workspace-overview)\n- Visualize cluster performance using [**Azure Managed Grafana**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) with out of the box dashboards that include cluster-level views, node-level views, and data links to easily move between them.\n- Run **PromQL queries** directly against Azure Monitor\n- Monitor **mixed fleets** (AKS + VMSS + standalone VMs) in one unified system\n\nAll of this is achieved through a **fully managed Prometheus backend**, with no servers, scaling, or storage to manage.\n\n![]()\n\n## Access Requirement\n\nThis feature is currently in **private preview**, and your Azure subscription must be **allowlisted** before you can use Azure Managed Prometheus for VMs/VMSS.\n\n[**Request access to the private preview**](https://forms.office.com/r/r5g9gDxayz)\n\nOnce approved, you will be notified and can proceed with the onboarding steps in the GitHub repository.\n\n## Try it yourself\n\nWe invite you to try it out and share your feedback with us. To get started, follow the [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/Azure/azhpc-guest-monitoring/blob/main/docs/azure-managed-prometheus-vms.md) in our GitHub repository to help you onboard to the preview quickly.\n\nOnce you’ve onboarded, you can begin scraping node and GPU metrics, run sample PromQL queries, and import ready-made HPC dashboards into Azure Managed Grafana.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using Azure Managed Prometheus for VM/VMSS and find the new capabilities valuable for your AI and HPC workloads. As this is a private preview, your feedback is especially important. Please share input by opening an issue in the GitHub repository.",
