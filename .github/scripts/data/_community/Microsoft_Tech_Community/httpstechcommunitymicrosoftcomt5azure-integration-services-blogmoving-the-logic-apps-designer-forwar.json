  "Description": "Today, we're excited to announce a major redesign of the Azure Logic Apps designer experience, now entering Public Preview for Standard workflows. While these improvements are currently Standard-only, our vision is to quickly extend them across all Logic Apps surfaces and SKUs.\n\n⚠️ Important: As this is a Public Preview release, we recommend using these features for development and testing workflows rather than production workloads. We're actively stabilizing the experience based on your feedback.\n\n# This Is Just the Beginning\n\n**This is not us declaring victory and moving on.** This is Phase I of a multi-phase journey, and I'm committed to sharing our progress through regular blog posts as we continue iterating. More importantly, **we want to hear from you.** Your feedback drives these improvements, and it will continue to shape what comes next.\n\nThis redesign comes from listening to you—our customers—watching how you actually work, and adapting the designer to better fit your workflows. We've seen the pain points, heard the frustrations, and we're addressing them systematically.\n\n# Our Roadmap: Three Phases\n\n**Phase I: Perfecting the Development Loop** (What we're releasing today) We're focused on making it cleaner and faster to edit your workflow, test it, and see the results. The development loop should feel effortless, not cumbersome.\n\n**Phase II: Reimagining the Canvas** Next, we'll rethink how the canvas works—introducing new shortcuts and workflows that make modifications easier and more intuitive.\n\n**Phase III: Unified Experiences Across All Surfaces** We'll ensure VS Code, Consumption, and Standard all deliver similarly powerful flows, regardless of where you're working.\n\nBeyond these phases, we have several standalone improvements planned: a better search experience, streamlined connection creation and management, and removing unnecessary overhead when creating new workflows.\n\nWe're also tackling fundamental questions that shouldn't be barriers: What do stateful and stateless mean? Why can't you switch between them? Why do you have to decide upfront if something is an agent? **You shouldn't.** We're working toward making these decisions dynamic—something you can change directly in the designer as you build, not rigid choices you're locked into at creation time. We want to make it easier to add agentic capabilities to any workflow, whenever you need them.\n\n# What's New in Phase I\n\nLet me walk you through what we're shipping at Ignite.\n\n## Faster Onboarding: Get to Building Sooner\n\n![]()\n\nWe're removing friction from the very beginning. When you create a new workflow, **you'll get to the designer before having to choose stateful, stateless, or agentic.** Eventually, we want to eliminate that upfront choice entirely—making it a decision you can defer until after your workflow is created. This one still needs a bit more work, but it's coming soon.\n\n## One View to Rule Them All\n\n![]()\n\n**We've removed the side panel.** Workflows now exist in a single, unified view with all the tooling you need. No more context switching. You can easily hop between run history, code view, or visual editor, and change your settings inline—all without leaving your workflow.\n\n## Draft Mode: Auto-Save Without the Risk\n\n![]()\n\nHere's one of our biggest changes: **draft mode with auto-save.**\n\nWe know the best practice is to edit locally in VS Code, store workflows in GitHub, and deploy properly to keep editing separate from production. But we also know that's not always possible or practical for everyone.\n\nIt sucks to get your workflow into the perfect state, then lose everything if something goes wrong before you hit save.\n\n**Now your workflow auto-saves every 10 seconds in draft mode.** If you refresh the window, you're right back where you were—but your changes aren't live in production. There's now a separate **Publish** action that promotes your draft to production.\n\nThis means you can work, test your workflow against the draft using the designer tools, verify everything works, and then publish to production—even when editing directly on the resource.\n\nAnother benefit: **draft saves won't restart your app.** Your app keeps running. Restarts only happen when you publish.\n\n## Smarter, Faster Search\n\nWe've reorganized how browsing works—no more getting dropped into an endless list of connectors. You now get proper guidance as you explore and can search directly for what you need. Even better, we're moving search to the backend in the coming weeks, which will eliminate the need to download information about thousands of connectors upfront and deliver instant results. Our goal: no search should ever feel slow.\n\n## Document Your Workflows with Notes\n\n![]()\n\nYou can now add **sticky notes anywhere in your workflow.** Drop a post-it note, add markdown (yes, even YouTube videos), and document your logic right on the canvas. We have plans to improve this with node anchoring and better stability features, but for now, you can visualize and explain your workflows more clearly than ever.\n\n## Unified Monitoring and Run History\n\n![]()\n\nMaking the development loop smoother means keeping everything in one place. **Your run history now lives on the same page as your designer.** Switch between runs without waiting for full blade reloads.\n\nWe've also added the ability to **view both draft and published runs**—a powerful feature that lets you test and validate your changes before they go live.\n\nWe know there's a balance between developer and operator personas. Developers need quick iteration and testing capabilities, while operators need reliable monitoring and production visibility. This unified view serves both: developers can test draft runs and iterate quickly, while the clear separation between draft and published runs ensures operators maintain full visibility into what's actually running in production.\n\n## New Timeline View for Better Debugging\n\n![]()\n\nWe experimented with a timeline concept in Agentic Apps to explain handoff—Logic Apps' first foray into cyclic graphs. But it was confusing and didn't work well with other Logic App types.\n\nWe've refined it. **On the left-hand side, you'll now see a hierarchical view of every action your Logic App ran, in execution order.** This makes navigation and debugging dramatically easier when you're trying to understand exactly what happened during a run.\n\n# What's Next\n\nThis is Phase I. We're shipping these improvements, but we're not stopping here. As we move into Phase II and beyond, I'll continue sharing updates through blog posts like this one.\n\n# How to Share Your Feedback\n\nWe're actively listening and want to hear from you:\n\n- Use the feedback button in the Azure Portal designer\n- Join the discussion in GitHub/Community Forum – https://github.com/Azure/LogicAppsUX\n- Comment below with your thoughts and suggestions\n\nYour input directly shapes our roadmap and priorities.\n\n**Keep the feedback coming.** It's what drives these changes, and it's what will shape the future of Azure Logic Apps.\n\nLet's build something great together.",
