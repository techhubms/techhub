  "EnhancedContent": "In the heart of a bustling city center, a mobile outreach team from a nonprofit sets up a pop-up care station. Within minutes, they’re checking in community members, recording case notes, and coordinating services with their central office—all from a single device. A thousand miles away, a social worker in a rural town conducts a telehealth intake session with a family who otherwise wouldn’t have access to care.\n\nAcross continents and causes, nonprofits are redefining what it means to serve—and technology is quietly powering this transformation behind the scenes.\n\n### Meeting the moment: The evolving needs of nonprofit work\n\nNonprofits have always been on the front lines of change, but their work today is more dynamic—and more digital—than ever. Teams must stay responsive in fast-changing environments, often with limited staff, tight budgets, and rising community needs. Whether it’s youth support, healthcare delivery, disaster relief, or advocacy, they are doing more with less—and doing it everywhere.\n\nMobility, security, and real-time collaboration have shifted from \"nice-to-have\" to \"must-have.\" Yet many organizations still rely on outdated hardware that hinders more than it helps.\n\nThat’s where the shift begins.\n\n### Technology that travels with the mission\n\nThe most effective nonprofit technology solutions don’t sit in an office—they move with the mission. Devices must be easy to carry, quick to deploy, and secure enough to handle sensitive data in the field. They must also adapt to a wide range of roles—from volunteers checking in at an event to case workers logging site visits or responding to emergencies.\n\nThe [Salvation Army New Zealand](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1787510957970094985-the-salvation-army-new-zealand-surface-nonprofit-en-new-zealand) understood this challenge well.

By equipping field workers with mobile-first devices and secure cloud access, they extended their care beyond urban centers—without adding IT complexity.\n\n> >\n> “Surface gives us the flexibility we need to be where our community needs us most.”\n> — The Salvation Army, New Zealand\n> >\n\nThis story isn’t unique.

Yet onboarding and equipping them can be time-consuming if the technology isn’t intuitive. Devices that support instant sign-in, cloud-based access, and familiar tools like Microsoft 365 allow volunteers to contribute quickly and confidently.\n\nImagine a community health event where volunteers rotate across check-in, data entry, and follow-up roles. With multi-mode devices that can switch from tablet to laptop and back, one device can serve many roles—maximizing both impact and investment.\n\nVitalant used Windows Autopilot to streamline device deployment across donation centers, allowing teams to stay focused on donors—not on tech.\n\nRead how [Vitalant streamlined deployment across mobile teams with Windows Autopilot and Surface](https://www.microsoft.com/customers/story/1782825466000513828-vitalant-windows-autopilot-non-profit-en-united-states)\n\n### Turning real-time data into real-life outcomes\n\nToday’s nonprofit leaders want more than anecdotal stories—they want data-driven insights to demonstrate impact, secure funding, and shape strategy. That means frontline teams must be able to capture data as it happens: during home visits, outreach drives, or counseling sessions.\n\nDevices with integrated transcription, e-signature support, and even AI-generated summaries are transforming how case workers and clinicians document their work. These tools help staff spend less time on paperwork and more time delivering care and services where they’re needed most.\n\nWhether it's a donor update or an urgent case referral, speed matters—and so does trust in the device that gets you there.\n\n### Security, sustainability, and scale: Behind-the-scenes priorities\n\nWhile visibility often focuses on programs, IT leaders at nonprofits must also balance security, sustainability, and long-term affordability. Devices that support end-to-end encryption, zero-touch deployment, and modular repair options offer both peace of mind and fiscal responsibility.\n\nSurface devices, particularly the latest Copilot+ PCs, are built with these principles in mind. Their AI capabilities—like summarizing reports or drafting emails—can help small teams scale their communications and reduce manual work, all while staying within nonprofit budgets and sustainability goals.\n\n### It’s not about the device. It’s about the mission.\n\nThe right device doesn’t just support the mission—it extends it.\n\nFor nonprofits, Surface is more than hardware. It’s a strategic partner that helps organizations stay agile, empower staff, and meet communities where they are. With trusted security, mobility built in, and powerful AI at the ready, nonprofits can focus on what they do best: creating lasting change.\n\n### Ready to empower your mission?\n\nNonprofits can access exclusive pricing, licensing, and deployment support through the [Microsoft Nonprofit Program.](https://nonprofit.microsoft.com/getting-started)\n\nEquip your teams with the tools to serve, respond, and lead—anytime, anywhere—with Surface and Copilot+ PC.\n\n#####\n\n##### Learn More\n\nDiscover how Surface and Microsoft 365 can help your nonprofit:\n\n- [Surface for nonprofits](https://www.microsoft.com/nonprofits/surface?msockid=247aaadc6fb86ad904a0bf366e986b70)\n- [Explore Microsoft's nonprofit offers](https://www.microsoft.com/nonprofits/offers-for-nonprofits)\n- [Customer stories and nonprofit impact case studies](https://www.microsoft.com/customers/search?filters=industry%3Anonprofit)\n\nUpdated Aug 11, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[!\\[Brandon_Dorfman&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xMTYzNjY0LUFNMEJ3UA?image-coordinates=0%2C67%2C880%2C948&amp;image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/brandon_dorfman/1163664) [Brandon_Dorfman](/users/brandon_dorfman/1163664) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined September 22, 2021\n\n[View Profile](/users/brandon_dorfman/1163664)\n\n/category/surfacedevices/blog/surfaceitpro [Surface IT Pro Blog](/category/surfacedevices/blog/surfaceitpro) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
