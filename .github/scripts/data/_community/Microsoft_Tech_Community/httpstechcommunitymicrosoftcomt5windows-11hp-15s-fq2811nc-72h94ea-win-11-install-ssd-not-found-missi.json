  "Title": "HP 15s-fq2811nc (72H94EA): Win 11 Install - SSD Not Found (Missing IRST Driver)",
  "Description": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm facing a critical issue while attempting a fresh installation of Windows 11 on my **HP Laptop 15s-fq2811nc (Product Number: 72H94EA)**. The system is currently running a Linux distribution, and I'm trying to replace it with Windows 11.\n\nDuring the Windows 11 setup, after selecting the language and accepting the terms, I reach the \"Where do you want to install Windows?\" screen. The installer fails to detect my internal storage drive (a 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD), and the list of drives is completely empty. The error message explicitly states: \"We couldn’t find any drives. To get a storage driver, click Load driver.\"\n\nBased on my research, this problem is a well-known issue with Windows 11 installation on systems equipped with 11th-generation Intel Core processors (in my case, the Intel Core i3-1125G4). These platforms often require the **Intel Rapid Storage Technology (IRST)** driver to be loaded manually during the installation process to recognize the NVMe SSD.\n\nI've already tried some basic troubleshooting steps, including checking the BIOS settings to ensure the SATA mode is set to AHCI, but this did not resolve the issue.\n\nI would be extremely grateful if someone could provide the following:\n\n1. **A direct link to the correct IRST driver package** for my specific laptop model, the HP 15s-fq2811nc. I've tried searching on the general HP support site, but it can be difficult to find the exact driver file that needs to be loaded.\n2. **Clear, step-by-step instructions** on how to load this driver during the Windows 11 installation. This includes what files to place on a separate USB drive and the exact steps to follow in the setup wizard.\n3. **Any other potential solutions or workarounds** that may be relevant, such as specific BIOS settings for this model.\n\nThis is a complete blocker for me, and I cannot proceed with the installation without this driver. Any help from the community would be highly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",
