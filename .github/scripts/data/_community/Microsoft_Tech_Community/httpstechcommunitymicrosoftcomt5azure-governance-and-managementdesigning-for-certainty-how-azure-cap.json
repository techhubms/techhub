  "Description": "Business‑critical services can’t afford “maybe” when it comes to compute availability. This post explores why capacity constraints are an industry‑wide reality, the role of Azure Capacity Reservations in ensuring placement, how they differ from Reserved Instances, and why using both is a strategic imperative for resilient architecture.\n\n#### **Why capacity reservations matter now**\n\nCloud isn’t running out of metal; demand is compounding and spiky. Peaks concentrate by region, zone, and VM SKU, especially for popular CPU families, memory-optimized sizes, and anything GPU-adjacent. Seasonal events (retail peaks), regulatory cutovers, emergency response, and bursty AI pipelines all create synchronized surges. Even with healthy regional capacity, a single zone or a specific SKU can be tight. Capacity Reservations acknowledge this reality and make it designable instead of probabilistic.\n\n- **Root reality:** Capacity is finite at the SKU-in-zone granularity, and demand arrives in waves.\n- **Risk profile:** The risk is not “no capacity in the cloud,” but “no capacity for this exact size in this exact place at this exact moment.”\n- **Strategic move:** Reserve what matters, where it matters, before you need it.\n\n#### **What capacity means in practice**\n\nThink of three axes: region, zone, and SKU. Your workload’s SLO ties to all three.\n\n- **Region:** Broadest pool; good for flexibility but not a zone guarantee.\n- **Zone:** Fault-domain isolation; also where contention often shows first.\n- **SKU:** The VM size is the constraint that bites (e.g., Standard\\_Dv5 vs Ev5, GPU families).\n\nAzure Capacity Reservations let you lock capacity for a specific VM size at the regional or zonal scope and then place VMs/scale sets into that reservation.\n\n#### **Pay‑as‑you‑go vs capacity reservations vs reserved instances**\n\n| **Attribute** | **Pay‑as‑you‑go** | **Capacity Reservations** | **Reserved Instances** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Primary purpose** | Flexibility, no commitment | Guarantee availability for a VM size | Reduce price for steady usage | | **What it guarantees** | Nothing beyond current availability | Capacity in region/zone for N of a SKU | Discount on matching usage (1‑ or 3‑year term) | | **Scope** | Region/zone at runtime, best‑effort | Bound to region or specific zone | Billing benefit across scope rules | | **Commitment** | None | Active while you keep it (on‑demand) | Term commitment (1 or 3 years) |\n\n#### **Key clarifications**\n\n- **Capacity reservations ≠ discount tool:** They exist to secure availability. You pay while the reservation is active (even if idle) because Azure is holding that capacity for you.\n- **Reserved Instances ≠ capacity guarantee:** They reduce the rate you pay when you run matching VMs, but they don’t hold hardware for you.\n- **Together:** Use Capacity Reservations to ensure the VMs can run; use Reserved Instances to lower the cost of the runtime those VMs consume.\n\n#### **This is universal, not just Azure**\n\nEvery major cloud faces the same physics: finite hardware, localized spikes, SKU-specific constraints, and growth in high-demand families (especially GPUs). AWS offers On‑Demand Capacity Reservations; Google Cloud offers zonal reservations. The names differ; the pattern—and the need—are the same. If your architecture depends on “must run here, as this size, right now,” you either design for capacity or accept availability risk.\n\n#### **When mission‑critical means “reserve it”**\n\nIf failure to acquire capacity breaks your SLO, treat capacity as a dependency to engineer, not a variable to assume.\n\n- **High-stakes cutovers and events:**\n- **Examples:** Black Friday, tax deadlines, trading close, clinical batch windows.\n- **Action:** Pre‑reserve the exact SKU in the exact zones for the surge window.\n- **HA across zones:**\n- **Goal:** Survive a zone failure by scaling in surviving zones.\n- **Action:** Hold headroom in each target zone proportional to failover load (e.g., N+1 or 60–100% of peak per zone depending on active/active vs active/passive).\n- **Change windows that deallocate/recreate:**\n- **Risk:** Maintenance that deallocates VMs can lose placement on restart.\n- **Action:** Associate VMs/VMSS with a capacity reservation group before deallocation.\n- **Fixed‑SKU dependencies:**\n- **Signal:** Strict perf profiles, licensing, or accelerators that bind you to a size family.\n- **Action:** Reserve by SKU; where possible, approve a “fallback SKUs” list and split reservations.\n- **Regulated or latency‑sensitive workloads:**\n- **Constraint:** Must run in a specific zone/region.\n- **Action:** Prefer zonal reservations to control both locality and availability.\n\n#### **How reserved instances complement capacity reservations**\n\n- **Two-layer strategy:**\n- **Layer 1: Availability:** Capacity reservations ensure your compute can be placed when needed.\n- **Layer 2: Economics:** Reserved Instances (or Savings Plans/EA equivalents) apply a pricing benefit to the steady‑state hours you actually run.\n- **Practical pairing:**\n- **Steady base load:** Cover with 1/3‑year Reserved Instances for maximum savings.\n- **Critical surge headroom:** Hold with Capacity Reservations; if the surge is predictable, you can still layer partial RI coverage aligned to expected utilization.\n- **Dynamic burst:** Leave as pay‑as‑you‑go or use short‑lived reservations during known windows.\n- **FinOps hygiene:**\n- **Coverage ratios:** Track RI coverage and capacity reservation utilization separately.\n- **Rightsizing:** Align reservations to the SKU mix you truly run; shift or cancel idle capacity reservations quickly.\n- **Chargeback:** Attribute the cost of “insurance” (capacity) to the workloads that require the SLO, separate from the cost of “fuel” (compute hours).\n\n-\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nIn today’s cloud landscape, resilience isn’t just redundancy; it’s about assured access to the exact resources your workload demands. Capacity Reservations remove uncertainty by guaranteeing placement, while Reserved Instances drive cost efficiency for predictable use. Together, they form a strategic duo that keeps mission‑critical services running smoothly under any demand surge. Build with both in mind, and you turn capacity from a risk into a controlled asset.",
