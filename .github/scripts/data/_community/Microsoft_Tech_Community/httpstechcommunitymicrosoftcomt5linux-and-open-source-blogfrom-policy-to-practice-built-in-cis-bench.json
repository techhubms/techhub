  "Description": "Security is more important than ever. The industry-standard for secure machine configuration is the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks. These benchmarks provide consensus-based prescriptive guidance to help organizations harden diverse systems, reduce risk, and **streamline compliance with major regulatory frameworks and industry standards like NIST, HIPAA, and PCI DSS**. In our [previous post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/linuxandopensourceblog/from-compliance-to-auto-remediation-azures-latest-linux-security-innovations/4297553), we outlined our plans to improve the Linux server compliance and hardening experience on Azure and shared a vision for integrating CIS Benchmarks. Today, that vision has turned into reality.\n\n**We're now announcing the next phase of this work: Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks are now available on Azure for all** [**Azure endorsed distros,**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros)**at no additional cost to Azure and Azure Arc customers.**\n\nWith today's announcement, you get access to the CIS Benchmarks on Azure with full parity to what’s published by the Center for Internet Security ([CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/)). You can adjust parameters or define exceptions, tailoring security to your needs and applying consistent controls across cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments - without having to implement every control manually. Thanks to this flexible architecture, you can truly manage compliance as code.\n\n| ![]() | ![]() | | --- | --- |\n\n## How we achieve parity\n\nTo ensure accuracy and trust, we rely on and ingest **CIS machine-readable Benchmark content** (OVAL/XCCDF files) as the source of truth. This guarantees that the controls and rules you apply in Azure match the official CIS specifications, reducing drift and ensuring compliance confidence.\n\n![]()\n\n## What’s new under the hood\n\nAt the core of this update is [azure-osconfig](https://github.com/Azure/azure-osconfig/tree/dev/src/modules/complianceengine)’s new compliance engine - a lightweight, open-source module developed by the Azure Core Linux team. It evaluates Linux systems directly against industry-standard benchmarks like CIS, supporting both audit and, in the future, auto-remediation. This enables accurate, scalable compliance checks across large Linux fleets. [Here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-osconfig/blob/dev/README.md) you can read more about azure-osconfig.\n\n### Dynamic rule evaluation\n\nThe new compliance engine supports simple fact-checking operations, evaluation of logic operations on them (e.g., anyOf, allOf) and Lua based scripting, which allows to express complex checks required by the CIS Critical Security Controls - all evaluated natively without external scripts.\n\n### Scalable architecture for large fleets\n\nWhen the assignment is created, the Azure control plane instructs the machine to pull the latest Policy package via the Machine Configuration agent. Azure-osconfig’s compliance engine is integrated as a light-weight library to the package and called by [Machine Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview) agent for evaluation – which happens every 15-30minutes. This ensures near real-time compliance state without overwhelming resources and enables consistent evaluation across thousands of VMs and Azure Arc-enabled servers.\n\n### Future-ready for remediation and enforcement\n\nWhile the Public Preview starts with audit-only mode, the roadmap includes per-rule remediation and enforcement using technologies like eBPF for kernel-level controls. This will allow proactive prevention of configuration drift and runtime hardening at scale. Please reach out if you interested in auto-remediation or enforcement.\n\n### Extensibility beyond CIS Benchmarks\n\nThe architecture was designed to support other security and compliance standards as well and isn’t limited to CIS Benchmarks. The compliance engine is modular, and we plan to extend the platform with STIG and other relevant industry benchmarks. This positions Azure as a platform for a place where you can manage your compliance from a single control-plane without duplicating efforts elsewhere.\n\n## Collaboration with the CIS\n\nThis milestone reflects a close collaboration between **Microsoft and the CIS** to bring industry-standard security guidance into Azure as a built-in capability. Our shared goal is to make **cloud-native compliance practical and consistent**, while giving customers the flexibility to meet their unique requirements. We are committed to continuously supporting new Benchmark releases, expanding coverage with new distributions and easing adoption through built-in workflows, such as moving from your current Benchmark version to a new version while preserving your custom configurations.\n\n### Certification and trust\n\nWe can proudly announce that azure-osconfig has met all the requirements and is[**officially certified**](https://www.cisecurity.org/partner/microsoft) by the CIS for Benchmark assessment, so you can trust compliance results as authoritative. Minor benchmark updates will be applied automatically, while major version will be released separately. We will include workflows to help migrate customizations seamlessly across versions.\n\n# Key Highlights\n\n- [**Built-in CIS Benchmarks** for Azure Endorsed Linux distributions](https://aka.ms/cisonazure)\n- **Full parity with official CIS Benchmarks content and** [**certified by the CIS for Benchmark Assessment**](https://www.cisecurity.org/partner/microsoft)\n- **Flexible configuration**: adjust parameters, define exceptions, tune severity\n- **Hybrid support**: enforce the same baseline across Azure, on-prem, and multi-cloud with Azure Arc\n- **Reporting format in CIS tooling style**\n\n# Supported use cases\n\n- **Certified CIS Benchmarks for all** [**Azure Endorsed Distros**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros) **- Audit only (L1/L2 server profiles)**\n- **Hybrid / On-premises and other cloud machines** with **Azure Arc** for the supported distros\n- **Compliance as Code** (example via Github -> Azure OIDC auth and API integration)\n- **Compatible with** [**GuestConfig workbook**](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-Defender-for-Cloud/tree/main/Workbooks/GuestConfiguration%20Result)\n\n# What’s next?\n\nOur next mission is to bring the previously announced auto-remediation capability into this experience, expand the distribution coverage and elevate our workflows even further.
