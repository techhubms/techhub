  "EnhancedContent": "## Introduction\nThis article explores advanced integration patterns for connecting Microsoft Copilot and other agentic solutions with leading enterprise platforms—SAP, ServiceNow, and Salesforce. It provides a practical overview of how Copilot, Copilot Studio, and Foundry by A2A and MCP can be orchestrated to enable seamless, intelligent automation and interoperability across these systems.\n\n1. **Copilot/Copilot Studio Integration with SAP (No Code)**\n\nBy integrating SAP Cloud Identity Services with Microsoft Entra ID, organizations can establish secure, federated identity management across platforms. This configuration enables Microsoft Copilot and Teams to seamlessly connect with SAP’s Joule digital assistant, supporting natural language interactions and automating business processes efficiently.\n\n**Key Resources as given in SAP docs (Image courtesy SAP):**\n\n- - [Configuring SAP Cloud Identity Services and Microsoft Entra ID for Joule](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/configuring-sap-cloud-identity-services-and-microsoft-entra-id-for-joule/ba-p/14105743)\n- [Enable Microsoft Copilot and Teams to Pass Requests to Joule](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/enable-microsoft-copilot-and-teams-to-pass-requests-to-joule/ba-p/14109137)\n\n1. **Copilot Studio Integration with ServiceNow and Salesforce (No Code)**\n\nIntegration with ServiceNow and Salesforce, has two main approaches:\n\n- - **Copilot Agents using Copilot Studio:**\nCustom agents can be built in Copilot Studio to interact directly with Salesforce CRM data or ServiceNow knowledge bases and helpdesk tickets. This enables organizations to automate sales and support processes using conversational AI.\n- [Create a custom sales agent using your Salesforce CRM data (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWl588bhrsc&amp;t=150s)\n- [ServiceNow Connect Knowledge Base + Helpdesk Tickets (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpRdT49U9Cw&amp;t=322s)\n- **3rd Party Agents using Copilot for Service Agent:**\nMicrosoft Copilot can be embedded within Salesforce and ServiceNow interfaces, providing users with contextual assistance and workflow automation directly inside these platforms.\n- [Set up the embedded experience in Salesforce](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-service/salesforce-integration)\n- [Set up the embedded experience in ServiceNow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-service/servicenow-integration)\n\n1. **MCP or Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Interoperability (Pro Code) - (Image courtesy SAP)**\n\nIf you choose a pro-code approach, you can either implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in a client/server setup for SAP, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, or leverage existing agents for these third-party services using Agent-to-Agent (A2A) integration. Depending on your requirements, you may use either method individually or combine them. The recently released Azure Agent Framework offers practical examples for both MCP and A2A implementations.\n\nBelow is the detailed SAP reference architecture, illustrating how A2A solutions can be layered on top of SAP systems to enable modular, scalable automation and data exchange.\n\n[Agent2Agent Interoperability | SAP Architecture Center](https://architecture.learning.sap.com/docs/ref-arch/e5eb3b9b1d/8)\n\n1. **Logic Apps as Integration Actions**\n\nLogic Apps is the key component of Azure Integration platform. Just like so many other connectors it has connectors for all this three platforms (SAP, ServiceNow, Salesforce). Logic Apps can be invoked from custom Agent (built in action in Foundry) or Copilot Agent. Same can be said for Power Platform/Automate as well.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis article provides a comprehensive overview of how Microsoft Copilot, Copilot Studio, Foundry by A2A/MCP, and Azure Logic Apps can be combined to deliver robust, agentic integrations with SAP, ServiceNow, and Salesforce. The narrative highlights the importance of secure identity federation, modular agent orchestration, and low-code/pro-code automation in building next-generation enterprise solutions.\n\nUpdated Oct 31, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[artificial intelligence](/tag/artificial%20intelligence?nodeId=board%3AAzureArchitectureBlog)\n\n[infrastructure](/tag/infrastructure?nodeId=board%3AAzureArchitectureBlog)\n\n[integration](/tag/integration?nodeId=board%3AAzureArchitectureBlog)\n\n[SAP on Azure](/tag/SAP%20on%20Azure?nodeId=board%3AAzureArchitectureBlog)\n\n[!\\[pranabpaul&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/m_assets/avatars/default/avatar-3.svg?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/pranabpaul/1216949) [pranabpaul](/users/pranabpaul/1216949) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined November 12, 2021\n\n[View Profile](/users/pranabpaul/1216949)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azurearchitectureblog [Azure Architecture Blog](/category/azure/blog/azurearchitectureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
