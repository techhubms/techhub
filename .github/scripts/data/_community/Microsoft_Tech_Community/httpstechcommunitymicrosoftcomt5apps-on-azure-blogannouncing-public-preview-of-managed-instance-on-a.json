Lift-and-Improve Legacy Applications\n\n**Technical:** Migrate legacy .NET apps with hardcoded file paths, COM dependencies, or registry access—no major code rewrites required. Install custom components directly on the managed instance.\n\n**Business:** Accelerate cloud adoption, reduce migration friction, and preserve business continuity by avoiding costly re-platforming projects. Realize Azure App Service benefits (scaling, patching, high availability) with minimal disruption.\n\n### 2. Re-platforming Hard-to-Modernize Apps\n\n**Technical:** Move applications with unavailable or hard-to-modify source code, or those tightly coupled to infrastructure (e.g., SMTP servers, MSMQ, legacy middleware). Managed Instance removes blockers by supporting custom installers and advanced networking.\n\n**Business:** Unlock value from legacy systems, extend their useful life, and enable phased modernization. Reduce risk and cost by avoiding “big bang” transformations.\n\n### 3. Hybrid and Regulated Workloads\n\n**Technical:** Integrate securely with on-premises resources using VNETs and private endpoints. Enforce data residency and access controls with Bring Your Own Storage and Managed Identity.\n\n**Business:** Meet compliance and regulatory requirements for industries like finance, healthcare, and government. Streamline audits and reduce operational overhead for sensitive workloads.\n\n### 4. Incremental Modernization\n\n**Technical:** Start with “lift-and-shift,” then incrementally adopt PaaS features—DevOps automation, dynamic scaling, centralized configuration—at your own pace.\n\n**Business:** Future-proof your application portfolio, drive ongoing innovation, and maximize ROI by continuously improving applications without major disruptions.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe’re delighted to be able to announce Managed Instance on Azure App Service and are eager to see it speed up and solve problems in your modernization journey.  Moving your workloads to Managed Instance on Azure App Service open up new opportunities for you to add business value and securely integrate with other Azure services.\n\nLook for the new marketplace item to create a Web App utilizing Managed Instance on Azure App Service\n\nGet started with Managed Instance on Azure App Service with our [documentation](https://aka.ms/managedinstanceonappservicedocs)and check out our [Technical Deep Dive on Managed Instance on Azure App Service at Ignite 2025](https://aka.ms/Ignite25/BRK102)\n\nUpdated Nov 17, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure app service](/tag/azure%20app%20service?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[web apps](/tag/web%20apps?nodeId=board%3AAppsonAzureBlog)\n\n[!\\[apwestgarth&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0yMTAyNS0yMjE3MDFpNThDRTRGOEU2RDZEMzMwOA?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/apwestgarth/21025) [apwestgarth](/users/apwestgarth/21025) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined October 03, 2016\n\n[View Profile](/users/apwestgarth/21025)\n\n/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog [Apps on Azure Blog](/category/azure/blog/appsonazureblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
