  "Description": "I am running **Azure DevOps Server 2022** in an environment that uses a proxy to access the internet. Multiple projects depend on various Node packages. While I can successfully download these packages through a browser using the configured proxy, the issue occurs when running pipelines on a **self-hosted agent**.\n\nThe agent installation completes successfully, but the pipeline fails during execution, seemingly due to lack of internet access.\n\nIs there a way to configure the proxy settings specifically for the **self-hosted agent** so that it can access the internet during pipeline runs?",
