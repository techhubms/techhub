Which is great for people who are 100% in the cloud but it doesn't really explain what their idea is to getting those running in hybrid mode.\n\nI also hear that MS wants to disconntinue the MFA app. If this is the case will they offer another app so that people can do passkeys?\n\nThanks,\n\nIâ€™m not sure where you heard they are getting rid of Authenticator but I highly doubt that.\n\nYou can extremely easily authenticate hybrid users in an office against the cloud and get access to local resources. Cloud Kerberos Trust.\n\nI have that cloud kerberos trust setup, I think. I setup something related to kerberos months ago, there is a computer entry in AD called AZUREADSSOACC.\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
