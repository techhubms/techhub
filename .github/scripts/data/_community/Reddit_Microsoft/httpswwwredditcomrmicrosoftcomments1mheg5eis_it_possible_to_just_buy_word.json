Check Office Home 2024 edition.\n\nHow on earth did you find this? Did you use some search engine or something? Or did you ask reddit?\n\n[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/office-home-2024/cfq7ttc0pqvj](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/p/office-home-2024/cfq7ttc0pqvj)\n\nIt used to be possible to buy just Word (or Excel, or PowerPoint).\n\nI can't imagine why anyone would have done that - even in the days before \"cheap\" MS Office it didn't make sense to pay $199.99 just for Word when the whole suite was $249.99 or $299.99.\n\nAnd technically, no version of Office lasts \"forever\". You *can* install (and use) Office 97, but absolutely no one would recommend it in 2025.\n\n> > >\n> And technically, no version of Office lasts \"forever\".

Would someone using 2007 and sharing files with someone using 365 or 2019 notice any issues? And vice versa?\n\nForever in this case means 2029 since that's when Office 2024 support will end. After a year from that opening any documents from external sources will be a risky move.\n\nLike it or not everything is moving towards subscriptions these days.\n\nOffice 365 is the cheapest subscription I have. For 10 installs and 6 people I pay $110 a year with 6TB of OneDrive.\n\nIf you want free Libre Office 3 is perfect and does most everything.\n\nA lot of people use Google Docs\n\nI'm too old. I like the idea of it being MY software. And I don't trust google docs because what if the internet crashes with my files.\n\nI've been using Libreoffice, but the problem is the files don't always open with other computers I use (Like I can't take a doc from home and open it on my school'scoputers.)\n\nJust splitting hairs, but you essentially never buy software, you license it. Now that license may be perpetual or have time limits, or be subscription, but it does spell out what you can legally do with the software.\n\nUse Apache Open Office. It's free, open source and fully compatible with MS Office",
