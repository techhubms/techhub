Windows 11 will be the mainstream desktop/client version of Windows for some time yet.\n\nWhen it stops getting updates and if Windows 12 won't install, just use Linux.\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
