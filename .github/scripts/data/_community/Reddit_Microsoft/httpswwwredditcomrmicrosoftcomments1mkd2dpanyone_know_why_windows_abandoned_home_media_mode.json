It allowed you to navigate with a remote or controller super easy. It was way before it's time in the mainstream space for home entertainment. I feel like, with the era of streaming boxes and expanding custom gaming PC's, Microsoft is missing out on a huge market not modernizing the \"home media mode\" and integrating the new Xbox platform, hell call it \"xbox mode\" or even competing with Google TV with a lite OS designed for streaming sticks. Allowing you to access all apps through a navigation screen like Xbox or a streaming device with a remote or controller. I know there is Kodi and other third party tools, it just seems like a huge missed opportunity to have a mode built in.\n\nThe company pivoted to focus on enterprise rather than consumer scenarios. Additionally, this was probably not used by a large percentage of people, so it likely got cut when developing windows 10.\n\nPartially because of the rise of streaming, but mostly because of antitrust things, and a little bit of international competition things\n\nThe problem with digital ownership with how things have been structured is it is worse for everyone. The creators/artists/developers of the media, whether music, video, or video games, whatever. The platform companies - Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, and the infinite grubby fingers who all think they should be the gatekeeper (because the gatekeepers get to say \"you gotta pay the troll toll to access what you already own because this is clown world\"). And of course us, who sometimes own multiple copies across multiple platforms - and sometimes lose access to those, still - and have to, to reiterate, pay to access what we already own. And are segregated, in the case of (some) video games, from being able to play (for free) with all the people who have the game.\n\nI don't think it was necessarily intentional for it to become as shit as it is, and I don't think it was really obvious until recently, but it definitely is, no matter how much people argue that competition is good. Sometimes, it is. But not in this context. There is a reason I listed platforms separately. Because platforms are a natural monopoly. Like infrastructure.\n\nIgnoring the stupid paywall for what I already own, all the platforms I own things on (too many) handles what they have as well as can be expected. And all could easily be \"the\" platform. But because nobody wants to give up 'their' (MY) space, and nobody wants to decide who gets what, things just continue to be shitty. Because technically, according to the letter of the law, we have zero rights\n\nIt was called MCE (media centre experience) and the Xbox 360 doubled as an MCE extender.\n\nIt was cool and all but very limited (I had to install a windows service called transcode360 so the 360 could play video codecs not natively supported).\n\nDon't know why they let MCE die but I don't miss it. All my devices are Google TV thesedays\n\nPlus, apps like Boxee (way way back), Plex, and oddly enough Xbox MediaCenter (stand alone app) did a much better job\n\nI loved Boxee. Mainly because it was the first app which had a concept where I could \"follow\" a TV show and see when a new episode was out.\n\nAh - Windows Media Center. The interface that spawned \"Metro\", the Zune player, and Windows Phone. It was beautiful and pretty functional.\n\nThe problem was, while it was great for playing DVDs, its more advanced functionality ( TV signal, channel listings) was complicated. Granted, that isn't Microsoft's fault - the broadcast and cable companies had little incentive to make it easy to do - but it limited those features to hobbyists who were willing to tinker.\n\nSo, it waved goodbye in Windows 8.1. Actually, Microsoft fired the whole Media Center team right after releasing Windows 7 in 2009 - so it kind of lingered on as legacy code for a while.\n\nAlthough, at least in Windows 10, [there are ways to install it](https://www.itechtics.com/windows-media-center/#:~:text=Windows%20Media%20Center).\n\nMac also had a mode like this maybe 25 years ago, \"Front Row\". The software was the inspiration for Apple TV, and Front Row was eventually removed from macOS.\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
