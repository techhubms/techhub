Thanks guys!\n\nThe second best thing is, I can still try the older models, if gpt5 doesn’t give me the answers I was looking for.\n\nI'm sure there are people who will repeated ask AI the same question in different ways until it comes back with the answer they're looking for, and then go around bragging to others that AI told him such and such and therefore, it must be true....\n\nCopilot is still shit. Threw a picture of a table at it. Break it into a table. Three columns. First numbers second content 3rd days for each.\n\nCopilot teams and 5 via Web said they could not. Chatgpt 5 straight away.\n\nHonestly copilot may be good for meeting notes but it's the stupidest ai in other aspects.\n\nI guess they give up on Copilot?\n\nThe various gpt models are what have been behind copilot from the start.\n\nMaybe you should ask chatgpt\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
