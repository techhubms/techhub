That is what they are doing.\n\nBingo. VCs have lit vast sums of cash on fire in the last few years on idiotic ideas like the metaverse and crypto. Now all the MBAs are all out of ideas and panicking, they need AI to work, but nobody asked for Clippy 2.0.\n\nThey’re creating systems of tracking and population control and selling them as Chatbots until they can get them online for their intended purpose. Just ask Larry Ellison\n\nThe moment you witness him publicly speaking about Palestine in a manner that aligns with extremist rhetoric like defending acts of terror and the kidnapping of hostages, uncritically embracing Hamas propaganda as factual evidence, and suggesting that a company like Microsoft should in any way endorse or reflect his radical beliefs.. well it becomes clear why his termination was both necessary and justified.\n\nThis sub is manic\n\nhttps://external-preview.redd.it/bPlxK2PRNYlK1ugv1ptpEUIGyMQlO4fS03PcCcm-d2A.gif?auto=webp&amp;s=9403223937c1869554b2eb97c92908d824b366b5\n\nCompletely agree.\n\nAnyone who goes on and onabout Gaza but never mentions China while pointing to Musk/X and ignoring blatant misinformation in the broader media collective immediately loses credibility.\n\nWell of course you would say that, half your posts are in [r/israel](/r/israel/) where you defend genocide. The world has had it and American opinions are pivoting\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
