This was a profit generating move pure and simple. If you listen to any of the Tech Podcasts that deal with MS in anyway, insiders are saying the moral at MS has never been this low among the employees. They are only screwing themselves in the long run with this crap.\n\n“Long run” doesn’t exist in the quarterly-profit driven world.\n\nhttps://external-preview.redd.it/YmXO5HdzSNmrXtwlAb2wjdJS3TOUB7D3147tkkt5zWg.gif?auto=webp&amp;s=e7a3fb7c7ce5c1efc84a7efbf75b53b557288c91\n\nOn the left hand, I let go of 15,000 employees.\n\nBut on the right hand, I love AI.\n\nGood thing I'm right-handed.\n\n- Satya\n\nNARRATOR\n\nHe does not.\n\nAbsolutely no one cares how this guy feels about the layoffs. Not even his mother.\n\nThese narcissists need to just shut up.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2024, Satya Nadella's total compensation from Microsoft was $79.1 million, a 63% increase compared to the previous year,\n\ncould've fooled me really\n\n\"I feel the weight... when you bring it up; otherwise, I'm good!\"\n\nWhat they forget the 1000s they layed off in 2024 and the studios closed and games cancelled then too ?",
