I can understand one's despise for Microsoft and Windows if one initially had high hopes of being hired by Microsoft only to have them dashed later. But, if one does not fall under the category, there is simply no reason to hate. Recently, I saw a post on the Linux sub reddit, in which a user talks of \"every stinking time he has to use Windows\" and yet the user goes on to tell how Blender gave the user problems on Linux, despite working fine on Windows. I do not see a reason for the user's complaint. In fact, I'm confused. Is the user frustrated because Windows does a better job. Linux users usually pretend as though Windows is a total crap. I'm a Linux user myself, and I use it not because I hate Windows but because my computer doesn't support Windows 11. Linux is not as good, and Windows is not as bad as they claim. Similarly, macOS users use every opportunity to defend their choice of using macOS, and I think Windows user's should also be more proud and appreciative of Windows.\n\nI use regularly all 3. I hate all 3.\n\nThis is true enlightenment.\n\nI also use all three, and hate them all. I would also add iOS and android as distinct operating systems, I hate them too.\n\nMacOS is the best of the worst, but that doesnâ€™t say a lot. They keep adding unnecessary ui tweaks, breaking workflows - but at least most new features seem to come and go or be implemented better in each release\n\nI appreciate that Windows runs everything all the way back to DOS. I appreciate that as a gamer, I can play games from Steam, GOG, Xbox with no performance penalties. I appreciate that security updates can make its way to my PC without me thinking about it too much. I appreciate that plugging in devices just work.\n\nI do not like being forced to have a Microsoft account and everything that goes with it (e.g. OneDrive) and being constantly tracked.\n\nGet out of the fake account, Nadella\n\nThis has nothing to do with Windows/Microsoft. It's just normal human in group/out group behavior.\n\nSame as pc gamers feeling superior over console gamers even though PC is much more likely to need troubelshooting to work than console.\n\nFans of alternative music hating a particular pop artist when they can just not listen to them\n\nFans of sports team x hating sports team y even though without other teams there would be no sport..\n\nList goes on. Dw about it, some people just enjoy hating as a hobby.\n\nWindows is *serviceable*. Wonderful is not a phrase I would use to describe the current state of the operating system, however.\n\nWindows XP, 7, 8.1, 10...those versions were not too bad to use. Windows 11 has been an utter shitshow though and I don't understand why more people haven't been calling Microsoft out on their nonsense\n\nSo in summary, some things are good, some things are bad, I saw a post, everything is fine.\n\nUh, great.\n\n> > >\n> there is simply no reason to hate\n> > > >\n\nI don't want to pay for an operating system that collects data, shows ads and does not allow you to uninstall Edge. This would be fine if it was free.\n\n> > >\n> Linux users usually pretend as though Windows is a total crap.\n> > > >\n\nIf you're a Linux user who likes Windows you'll probably become a Windows user. If Windows is total crap for you, you'll switch to Linux. It's an opinion.\n\nMy reason for dumping Windows was the constant erosion of privacy and choice.\n\nI've been using Windows since 3.1. Windows 10 was pretty alright upon initial release, but you could start to see the signs throughout Win 10's lifecycle. Every update seemed to add some sort of pop-in advertising crap, like the search bar, and \"Cortana\" which was useless. Updates started happening automatically, which caught me a few times when I left work open overnight and came back to work being stopped. Then I picked up a Lenovo that came with Win11 that was intended for development work. It took me about 3 hours of initial use before I got fed up with all the garbage that needs to be cleaned out of it. I've been a Linux user for work for about 16 years, and had another laptop that I put Ubuntu on that worked fine and was never overtly intrusive, nor did it constantly force garbage on me, or reboot itself for updates while unattended. So, the 3 hour old Lenovo got wiped, and now it runs on Ubuntu. My other development laptop is currently on Fedora KDE, which I actually prefer. Meanwhile, my single, remaining Win10 machine I have had to disable or remove CoPilot AI bullshit from it 3 times now, as updates come overnight and reapply that crap. Not to mention, every other update seems to find a reason to nag me about setting up my Microsoft account, which isn't happening. I don't need an online account for local hardware. Just no.\n\nI have a choice between Windows 11 with it's constant unattended restarts, system notifications, and forcing their shitty AI all over it to scrape my data, and constantly bitching at me to sign up for a Microsoft account\n\nor\n\nI have my Fedora KDE laptop. I flip open the lid, log in using my local account creds or fingerprint instead of some vendor 3rd party account I have to maintain, and then I pick up wherever I left off last time I used it, without intrusive notification pops about features and ads, no search bar with AI sparkle bullshit all of it that I have to spend time removing only to have it return in another unattended update, it requires my input before it is allowed to update itself, and just generally stays out of my way while I get work done.\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
