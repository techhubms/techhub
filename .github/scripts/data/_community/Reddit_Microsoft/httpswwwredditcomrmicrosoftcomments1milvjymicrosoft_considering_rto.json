Everyone is a QA tester now!\n\nThe entire pitch for Teams is remote work\n\nMicrosoft has a lot of people who are 100% remote. I can see bringing the “50% remote” into the office more often but wonder what will happen to the ones who are fully remote.\n\nThis also weighs heavily on Satya Nadella. /s\n\nBecause those record profits could have been even more record-er if only those damned employees were in an office building.\n\nIt's a strategic plan. You lay off 15k, then force the remaining to come to office. But since they've been fully remote for 5 years now, many moved far away from the office you get many more that will be forced to voluntarily quit.\n\nWhat has Microsoft become? Use to be the go-to place to work. Now morale is at all time low and they pull this.\n\nAKA need to lay off more people, RTO is the way to lay off people without reporting layoffs\n\nThey think you’ll be more productive at the office and I can tell you for a fact, that absolutely won’t happen. You’ll be interrupted more, you’ll be stuck on the subway/traffic more, you’ll end up taking more breaks etc. And ultimately and most importantly, you’ll be less happy and end up giving them less overall. These companies are so stubborn.\n\nCool... So no office... Just an open giant room, where you feel like a monkey in a zoo.... That's why no one wants to come back to office!\n\n\"hey, we want you back in office, but will only provide you with the harshest office environment around!\"",
