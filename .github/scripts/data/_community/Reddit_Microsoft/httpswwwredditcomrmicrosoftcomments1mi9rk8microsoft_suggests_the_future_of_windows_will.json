It was excellent and I miss it a lot.\n\nWindows 10 is what Win8 and Phone 8 should’ve been.\n\nThe interconnectivity features we see nowadays on other OS like iOS-macOS was something Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 had in 2012.\n\n> > >\n> it sounds like he's teasing a future where agentic AI is a primary orchestrator for the Windows OS, utilizing natural language and input from the user as a method of interacting with your computer and apps.\n> > > >\n\nYes, because forcing me to type \"Open Firefox and navigate to Reddit\" is much more quick, efficient, and user friendly than clicking an icon on my toolbar and then click a link in my bookmarks toolbar.\n\nOr making me interrupt a voice call \"Okay, yeah, I can help you with that, let me find a quick photo of what we're dealing with, one second, hey cortana, can you do a google image search for this thing? No, I don't want to use Bing, Google. No, I don't want to backup my photos to OneDrive while I'm at it, just show me the f\\*\\*\\*ing photo. Okay, I got a pic, so the first step is....\"\n\nThe best is yet to come... Blah, blah, blah...\n\nMarketing...\n\nJust like every Windows OS upgrade, am I right?\n\nSomething something something AI something else\n\nIt's going to be AI AI AI AI AI AI AI fml\n\nDepends how this is all implemented. Given the recent track record for shoving copilot down our throats though, I don't hold a lot of faith just yet.\n\nHonestly, Windows 11 has made me lose trust in the whole Windows lineup. I have two laptops, one at work and one at home.\n\nAt home, I use a Windows PC, and at work, I have a Mac. The difference is night and day. When I start my Mac, it feels so fast and refreshing, but on my Windows 11 PC, I have to deal with antivirus notifications, Adobe update popups, Nvidia driver alerts, and random app popups for programs I didn’t even remember installing.\n\nAnd then there’s Copilot, which just feels pointless to me. It’s frustrating, and I seriously don’t get how this is supposed to be the “future” of operating systems.",
