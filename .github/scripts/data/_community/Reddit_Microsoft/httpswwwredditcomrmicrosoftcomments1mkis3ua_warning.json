With a complete off-line installation, using only local accounts, nothing signed in on the Microsoft side either in the store or on the actual Windows 11. It actually remembered the previous apps that I actually used in the Windows Store without being signed in.\n\nIt’s telemetry hooks go deeper than I suspected because it’s even matching your computer ID to what you actually do on the system and doesn’t seem to reset after a full wipe.\n\nNormally don’t use the Windows Store, but I just happened to notice this and I didn’t like what I found out. You kind of figure everything would be wiped with a fresh install but now everything is tied to the ID of your computer.\n\nI’m not looking for support or anything else like that, but just I wanted to share what I found .\n\nThis is not something that is hidden, it is the Microsoft Graph, [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview)\n\nLike a hardware ID correlation. Just don’t use the Microsoft store imo. I run win11debloat and shutup10 on every machine and never have any issue with privacy.\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
