The more they change it, the more they break it.\n\nPeople want 2 things. A stable system and a consistent UI. They haven't even made the design language consistent and they want to change it up in the next major version?\n\nYou had SO many people that hated the new explorer that they had to install Mods so they got the old explorer back.\n\nPeople hated the new Paint and photo viewer so they installed mods to get the old one back.\n\nMS has the problem of being the OS that 90% of corporations use. They are stuck with so much legacy crap that they can never fully modernize.\n\nI work in IT and have for 20+ years. Apple had this same issue 15 or so years ago when they moved fully away from OS9 compatibility. The company I worked for at the time had to bite the bullet and replace every network printer, and every large format printer in the building since they were not compatible with native OSX. The drivers for them didn't exist.\n\nThat was a company of less than 100 people at that time. Now think of that but in the tens of thousands for some large enterprises. MS has to keep some its legacy code that definitely bogs it down with every new iteration.\n\nAt the same time MS has to come out with a new OS / features or the industry will scream that they are falling behind, and their stock will lose value.\n\nReally, MS Windows is suffering from its own success.\n\nWhy does Microsoft need to modernise? Security yes. Everything else no.\n\nThis isn't like a smart phone when you want the flashiest thing. This is an OS, the core things people need are speed, reliability and security. Like why do people need a cooler start menu. Why do people need AI in Notepad?\n\nThere’s not much consistency to speak of for the past two decades, and Microsoft is still in the process of addressing that.\n\nSome people hate new stuff by default, and some people always prefer their own designs. Microsoft doesn’t have to (also is unable to) do much for those people besides giving them the tools to do what they want.\n\nOne way to get Microsoft to do as you want is to utilise the Feedback button. No feedback is interpreted as approval.\n\nPeople also just hate change and regardless what you give them it’ll never be as good as the old stuff.\n\nMicrosoft just takes too long to update, by the time they are finished it’s outdated and need to change it all, so there is no consistency, because they cannot catch up.\n\nI agree it took time for people to get around to Win 10. But change does not mean it's good. Good change is good.\n\nOld paint is faster than New paint. Old explorer is faster than new explorer and that's been a common complaint.\n\nPeople want a consistent UI? Do they really?\n\nYou just traded the \"consistent UI\" of paint and photos to roll back to the old version.\n\nThis is the difference between Microsoft and Apple when it comes to UI. Apple dictates the UI and the user is forced to move forward with them. There is no choice.\n\nMicrosoft Windows would have open rebellion if they were that heavy handed. Look at all the Win 11 holdouts. They don't want the \"new and improved\" OS - they want what they know and are familiar with.\n\nThat and the massive installed base means that Microsoft can only have one eye on the future. The other they have to keep on backwards compatibility and legacy systems.\n\nyes\n\nMicrosoft hasn't prioritized a consistent design language in their own products for over 15 years, at this point they even seem to have internally abandoned using common implementations. The shift towards using web apps to replace desktop apps has only further eroded any kind of consistent user experience which is a bit amusing because that used to be a priority for Microsoft.\n\n[GPT-5 Now in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)",
