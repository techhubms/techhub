Holy moly!!!! Scarry how much is filtered out due to being in other weird countries!!!\n\nMaybe to adjust the meteo in calendar?\n\nCheck timezone for utc offset.\n\nNew Outlook has a feature to let you see other colleagues that are physically working in the office\n\nBecause Microsoft feels the need to know every single bit of information about you. So they can sell it to the highest bidder\n\nTo be able to send you adds and news via that Notifications thing\n\nTBF, I forget the notification thing is there because I never open it.\n\nI don't know why this is getting downvoted. Ad personalization based on location is maybe the most effective advert you can create.\n\nHow to turn off ads in Windows: [https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-disable-microsofts-ads-and-recommendations-in-windows-11/](https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-disable-microsofts-ads-and-recommendations-in-windows-11/)\n\nPerhaps to give you the local weather info?
