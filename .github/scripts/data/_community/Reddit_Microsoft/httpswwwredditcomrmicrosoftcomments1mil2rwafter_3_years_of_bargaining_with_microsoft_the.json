A long history of devalued QA labor in the games industry has motivated similar worker organization efforts for testers at other studios like ZeniMax.\n> > > >\n\n> > >\n> While Activision resisted the nascent unionization efforts at its studios, Microsoft said during its still-underway Activision-Blizzard acquisition in 2022 that it wouldn't oppose the Raven QA union and other Activision worker organizations. In the years since, however, union negotiations stalled, eventually provoking a strike from the GWA-CWA's peers at ZeniMax. The ZeniMax union reached its own tentative contract agreement with Microsoft in June.\n> > > >\n\n> > >\n> Today, Raven's QA staff celebrate their contract as a victory for workers throughout the industry.\n> > > >\n\n> > >\n> \"Going from organizing to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there,\" said GWA-CWA bargaining committee member Autumn Prazuch. \"We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path, and we were able to negotiate limitations on mandatory crunch. Ratifying this contract is a win for game workers everywhere who are ready to take the first step toward a better future.\"\n> > > >\n\nIn the wave of layoffs maybe not the best move.\n\nYou think a union under Microsoft will fix that ? Think again , they know how to union bust",
