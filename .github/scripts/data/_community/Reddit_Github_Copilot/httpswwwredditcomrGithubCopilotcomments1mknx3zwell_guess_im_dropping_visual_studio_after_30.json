MS knows this and are treating it like a stepchild.\n\nDefinitely feels that way.\n\nWhat's the alternative if you want a free IDE for C# ? Rider is free but not for commercial apps\n\nI prompt in VS Code, and use Visual Studio when I actually write code. I have 2 IDEs up at all times now.\n\nTook ya long enough\n\nVisual Studio copilot is not very usable. I still use VS code for c# code and then do debugger in visual studio if needed\n\nI only use visual studio for debugging. Visual code for anything else.\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
