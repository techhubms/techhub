  "EnhancedContent": "Let's fly with Copilot\n\nYep, confirm. Its available.\n\nBe sure to have it enabled in your CoPilot settings.\n\nEdit:\n\nFirst impression.\n\n> > >\n> Give me a summary of the following code and point out ways to improve it\n> > > >\n\n- GPT5: Provides extra long summary, displays 10 points with sub points to improve, and shows ONE code example what to improve and how.\n- GPT4.1: Provides a short summary, shows 6 points with subpoints (like GTP5), and shows ONE code example what to improve and how.\n- Claude 4: Gives a short description, displays FIVE code example what to improve and how.\n\n- GPT5 gives more improvement points in total but 3 are more or less fluff (include testing, add metrics ... ). 4 are advice ... 4 have actually to really do with code issues. The summary is very, how to say ... like somebody giving a bulletin point list with function naming. Very analytic like but not really human like summary.\n- GTP 4.1. 3 Are code issues, two are advice, one is fluff. Worst summary of the bunch. As in really bad.\n- Claude feels better as it focuses on the code, all 5 are indeed code issues (one more discovered then GPT5). And no fluff advice. Much more to the point of the issues. More summary then 4.1, less long then 5.0. Its a actual summary without using function names, not so analytic like 5.0.\n\nGTP5 feels very 4.1 like but with much more text being displayed. Tomorrow will play around more but first impression on a single prompt, GPT 4.2 with more text? Will need to do more testing but yea, feel too analytic if that makes sense?\n\nI thought we can do unlimited chat with gpt-5 just like 4.1 in paid versions ðŸ˜‚. As both prices per tokens are the same approx\n\nyeah makes no sense to be x1 when its so much cheaper than premium models\n\nWeird, they only gave us one variant on Copilot. I also have a Windsurf sub, and it came with three options GPT-5 low, medium, and high reasoning. With low and medium free of credits.\n\n1x premium for their own model is s bit too much no? Maybe API has better deal\n\nWorks better than sonnet 4?\n\n> > >\n> Works better than sonnet 4?\n> > > >\n\nClaude is like your grumpy no nonsense Senior dev, lots of years of hands on experience. Where as GPT 5 feels like a university professor, more focused on writing essays / analytical writing for peer review. If that makes any sense?\n\nClaude 4 &gt; Gemini 2.5 Pro &gt; GPT 5 ... big gap ... Beast Mode 4.1 &gt; GPT 4.1\n\nClaude has a much better code focus (and better prompt usage). You can tell that Anthropic focuses on code, where as the other models feels more academic. For me Claude feels more warmer, if that makes sense?\n\nWith a cost of 1 premium request, just like Claude 4.0. There really is no reason to use it over Claude. If it was free or ultra cheap (like 0.33), sure, you can give up some of your time to be more explicite or create better instructions.\n\nI really disagree on a 1 premium request price for GPT5.\n\nStill not tried Agent usage.\n\nNo\n\nIn some cases (like 50%) where it doesnâ€™t require much reasoning it actually failed to do anything useful. GPT-4.1 is even better than GPT-5 in that case.\n\nFinally! I refreshed my vsc like a 100 times when it first released hopping that it will magically appear lol\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
