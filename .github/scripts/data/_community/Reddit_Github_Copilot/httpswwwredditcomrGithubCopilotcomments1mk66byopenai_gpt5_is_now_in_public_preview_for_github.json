I like how it's always straight to the point and doesn't commit to small talk like the other models do. I'm hoping this remains the case, but I have yet to ask it to do more complex tasks.\n\nx1? Sounds weird, it should be same as 4.1\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/k6re7txk3nhf1.gif\n\nI don't see it!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1mk7d03/comment/n7gpxd5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1mk7d03/comment/n7gpxd5/)\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
