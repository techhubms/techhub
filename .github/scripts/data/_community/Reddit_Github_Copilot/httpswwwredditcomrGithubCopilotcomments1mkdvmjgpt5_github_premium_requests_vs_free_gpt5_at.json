  "EnhancedContent": "Let's fly with Copilot\n\nWhy does GitHub GPT-5 charge Premium Requests when GPT-5 at [copilot.microsoft.com](http://copilot.microsoft.com) is free? This isn't about VSCode integration, repo-awareness, and agency since those are available for \"default\" i.e. non-premium models. Is GitHub GPT-5 somehow concretely, substantially better than GPT-5 at copilot.microsoft.com? Sources?\n\nBecause copy pasting stuff back and fort sucks and no one can do that to the degree that exceeds their free limit.\n\nProbably just a capacity thing. Github and Microsoft must have different allocation. They probably need to wait for their turn. They need to reboot all those GPT-4o cluster in GPT-5.\n\nI mean you can use Claude for free on their app or website.\n\nThe benefit is the direct integration with your IDE. And I’m sure there are far less rate limits on GitHub Copilot than through Microsoft’s web version.\n\nSame business, different products\n\nGithub Copilot snippets can’t be used to train the models like messages and feedback on microsoft’s copilot can.\n\nLikely some contractual obligation between OpenAI and Microsoft tying free usage with training data.\n\nThat is not true for public repos I believe\n\nThe version at that URL seems to be really dumb. I'm having a hard time coding with it as it hallucinates table names in my SQL and doesn't conform to the style of the existing code. Way worse than the GPT5 in VSCode for some reason. Maybe this is the \"minimal\" level model? I would say it is dangerously bad from the code it created for me. (and for reference I do have it set on Smart GPT5)\n\n[!\\[Comment Image\\](https://preview.redd.it/gpt-5-github-premium-requests-vs-free-gpt-5-at-copilot-v0-8vcmq74nlrhf1.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40e4806a34bb8d9941e6c9349c9a51f08b762ff8)](https://preview.redd.it/gpt-5-github-premium-requests-vs-free-gpt-5-at-copilot-v0-8vcmq74nlrhf1.png?width=913&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40e4806a34bb8d9941e6c9349c9a51f08b762ff8)\n\nedit: if you can force it into the \"Thinking\" mode the output is far better\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
