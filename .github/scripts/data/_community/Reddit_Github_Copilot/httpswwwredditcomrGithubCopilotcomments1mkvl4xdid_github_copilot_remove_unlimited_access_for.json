In the past, there was no usage limit for me, and I could use it without worrying about hitting any quota.\n\nHowever, recently I noticed something different. When I opened my Copilot sidebar, I saw usage bars showing **Code completions** and **Chat messages** percentages, along with a reset date — just like in the attached screenshot. It now says my allowance will reset at the end of the month, which looks exactly like the usage limits for regular Copilot accounts.\n\nThis is confusing because:\n\n- I have an active Education account (verified through GitHub Student Developer Pack).\n- I don’t have Copilot Pro.\n- In the past, my usage never had any visible quota or limit.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Did GitHub recently remove **unlimited Copilot access** for Education accounts?\n2. Are all Education accounts now under the same limits as normal accounts?\n3. Or is this just a display change, and the actual usage is still unlimited?\n\nHas anyone else with an Education account experienced the same thing?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nYour bill up to that limit gets deducted, above that you have to pay, it is larger than free tier.\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
