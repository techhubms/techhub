  "EnhancedContent": "Let's fly with Copilot\n\nMatching Opus for 7,5x LESS output token cost and 10x less input tokens costs is crazy good.\n\nIf Github Copilot Pro switches 4.1 for 5 for unlimited requests, and it truly codes as good as Opus (or even Sonnet 4), then it's one crazy improvement.\n\nThey didn't switch, it still cost 1x usage even when the price is 0.4x less than sonnet4 lol\n\nTwo years and endless hype isn’t crazy good lol.\n\nFor 1/10 of the price that's fantastic! It is also the best model at UI!\n\nIt's their base model though. That means it's more cost effective than Opus 4 with the same thinking power. That's actually a pretty big deal.\n\nIt’s not their base model. It’s priced at 1x premium request.\n\nBro, if they change 4.1 for 5 as unlimited model and it is as good as opus it would be insane\n\no3 bar height !? Score 69, but height same as 30. Intern made this !\n\nOpus for 1/10th the price and half the hallucinations? Sounds pretty good to me!\n\nFrom the technical paper:\n\n\"All SWE-bench evaluation runs use a fixed subset of n=477 verified tasks which have been validated on our internal infrastructure. Our primary metric is pass@1 because in this setting we do not consider the unit tests as part of the information provided to the model. Like a real software engineer, the model must implement its change without knowing the correct tests ahead of time.\"\n\nThat score is from cherrypicked tasks (presumably where it passes) and missing 23 tasks (presumably where it failed).\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
