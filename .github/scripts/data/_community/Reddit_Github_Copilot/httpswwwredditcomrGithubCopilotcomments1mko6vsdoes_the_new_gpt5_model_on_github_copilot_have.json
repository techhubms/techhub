The cursor shows 4 versions, High medium and nano and chat gpt 5.\n\nGPT 5 without thinking, what's quick is what's dumb. I was expecting Kimi or Qwen Coder's level, but it's much lower.\n\nGPT 5 performed about ten times better on Copilot than on Cursor, I can't explain why.\n\nHigh seems like it will only be for those who subscribe to the most expensive plan, which doesn't make sense since the price of APi is the same as Gemini 2.5\n\nWhen it goes into the \"Thinking\" mode, the output is good. Otherwise, it is not. Need to find a way to always force it.\n\nHello [u/WarKhan35](/user/WarKhan35/). Looks like you have posted a query.
