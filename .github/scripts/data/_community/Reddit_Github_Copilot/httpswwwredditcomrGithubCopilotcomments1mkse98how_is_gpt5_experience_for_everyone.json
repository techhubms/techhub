  "EnhancedContent": "Let's fly with Copilot\n\nFinally tried with GPT-5, seems good for react, finally!\n\nFor ML/Data Science, it still feels not that great! like Sonnet 4 good!\n\n**Coding**\n\nIts a more consistent, more verbose, still very analytical but clearly better then GPT4.1. Is it worth moving from Claude to GPT5?\n\nLike i posted somewhere else:\n\nClaude 4 &gt; Gemini 2.5 Pro &gt; GPT 5 ... big gap ... Beast Mode 4.1 &gt; GPT 4.1\n\nFrom a coding point of view, the gap has closed between GPT and Claude but there is still a gap.\n\nIts better out of the box then GPT4.1 but i think its more GPT4.2, then a major jump like 4.1 &gt; 5.0. Its more evolution / improvements, then revolutionary.\n\n**Cost**\n\n- At 1 premium token GPT5. Absolutely not. Claude is way better at the same cost usage.\n- At 0.33 or free. Sure ... I am willing to give up some more time to wrangle it.\n\nAnd that i think its a major issue, especially when its in the same cost range as Claude and Gemini. What makes no sense, if the per million token cost is very similar to 4.1.\n\nSo in my opinion, MS fumbled with making it a 1 premium request.\n\nOf the 3 jobs I've had to do, it didn't fail even when editing the files. For now 3/3.\n\nI'm curious what would happen if I use it with Beast Mode V3.1 ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜…\n\nI am so confuse, everyone is saying itâ€™s good while I am having terrible results with it. Using it on using it on vscode copilot chat agent mode.\n\nIt is EXTREMELY slow and seems to take a long time reading many many files in my code base, often reading files that is not related to the task it was given. I am talking about at least 3-5 mins of reading files before it starts working on the task while providing no output of what it is trying to do. I am assuming it is a thinking model that does not provide its thinking output?\n\nIt also did not work with the tasksync workflow that I have been using where I communicate back and forth with the AGENT via a task.md file which the AGENT will periodically check via terminal command.\n\nThe only one task which impressed me is to where I asked it to redesign the UI of a component while keep the existing functionality intact. It was pretty much able to one-shot the design with a nice clean UI that looks much better than sonnet 4â€™s UI design.\n\nwhat are you using to prevent constant confirms, the settings.json is no longer working, im constantly getting confirm pauses.\n\n``` \"chat.tools.autoApprove\": true, \"chat.agent.maxRequests\": 100, ```\n\nCould you please tell me how to change these settings? Thanks a lot\n\nThere was a very small but important bug that i could not solve it with other ai models but then in the morning i have tried gpt5, with 1 shot, it fix the bug very quickly and then i suprised and asked for very easy implementation error to fix it. But gpt5 spend almost 10-15 minutes and i think it is very slow, waiting a lot and finally it messed up the entire code but then i switched to sonnet 4. It changed very small part of the code and i am done. Therefore i have mix feelings whether it is good or bad really but at least trying more than gpt4.1\n\nFor now it is slow (maybe roll-out related, since everyone is moving over their services at once), but the results I had so far are good. Will compare to Sonnet 4 forth and back for a while to decide what will be the default.\n\nIt is super slow, I'm pretty sure it is not even thinking maybe just overloaded\n\nArenâ€™t different models better with some languages than other models? If thatâ€™s the case then youâ€™d really have to compare across models using the same language.\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
