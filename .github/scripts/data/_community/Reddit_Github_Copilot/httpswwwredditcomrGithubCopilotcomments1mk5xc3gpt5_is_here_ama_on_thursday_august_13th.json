Off-by-one errors.\n\nwill gpt 5 the new base model with unlimited usage like 4.1 and if yes which variant?\n\nNot initially at least it seems.

Seems to generally have a better understanding of the codebase which is nice.\n\nIt‚Äôs too bad Opus 4 didn‚Äôt make it to Agent mode for comparison.\n\n[u/hollandburke](/user/hollandburke/) GPT-5 Beast Mode? Unnecessary? WIP? Share your thoughts! *wink*\n\nFor Github Copilot, how come GPT 4.1 is a base model, consuming 0 premium request, while o4-mini consumes 0.33 premium request, when the API call price is more expensive for GPT 4.1? According to¬†[https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing), GPT 4.1 costs $2, $8 for input, output while it is $1.1, $4.4 for o4-mini. How it's possible for the more expensive model to becocme the base model?\n\nI am asking you this question because I hope GPT 5 to be the base model as it's cheaper than GPT 4.1, but it doesn't seem to be the case as GPT 5 is already introduced on Github Copilot, consuming 1 premium request :¬†[https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fbpm3g2dx3nhf1.png%3Fwidth%3D944%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dfc09bf26706dca612e596b566e892ad8c4f1baf2](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fbpm3g2dx3nhf1.png%3Fwidth%3D944%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dfc09bf26706dca612e596b566e892ad8c4f1baf2)\n\nGPT-5, which consumes 1 premium request on Github Copilot, is it thinking model or non-thinking model?\n\nI would definitely appreciate and ask that the team makes GPT-5 the default model, not only will this drive innovation and people to Copilot, it will also generate ideas, community, and which is much more valuable to Copilot.\n\nWill you upgrade the model for auto completions and if so which one\n\nAny plans on making o1 as the default model as it costs the same as Gpt4.1?\n\nLet's fly with Copilot",
