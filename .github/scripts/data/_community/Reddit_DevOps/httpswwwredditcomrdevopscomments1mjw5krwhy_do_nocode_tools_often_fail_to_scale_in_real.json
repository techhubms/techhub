  "Title": "Why do no-code tools often fail to scale in real world use cases?",
  "FeedLevelAuthor": "Everything DevOps",
  "EnhancedContent": "I've been burned by no-code tools a few times now. They're amazing for building a quick prototype or a simple internal app. But as soon as you try to scale it up, add more complex logic, or integrate with real production systems, they just seem to fall apart. Why does this happen? Is there something fundamentally limited about the no-code approach or am I just picking the wrong tools? It feels like you always end up needing to write actual code.\n\nBecause complex logic is indistinguishable from coding\n\nThis. The epiphany of no-code finally hit when I saw that I wanted a \"one line expression to modify this no-code setup\"\n\nCode had become the desire.\n\n'Code' is like it is and has always been like it is for good reason, too. Structured text expressions can represent so much more, so much more efficiently, than boxes and lines drawn on a 2D surface.\n\nI'm a little unpopular at my day job for maintaining that the low code dream is snake oil in the face of network engineers getting excited about the latest n8n influencer content, but I have yet to see anything convincing to the contrary.\n\nI'd argue software development isn't actually about code, that's just the tool we use for the most part. Rather I belive it's fundamentally about developing processes.\n\nLooking at it from that perspective it's no surprise that no-code solutions end up failing. If you wouldn't trust the software someone made with actual code it'd be insane to trust the code they made with \"Scratch for business majors\".\n\nBecause coding is the easy part of developing an app. Taking it away doesn't solve any of the hard problems.\n\nCame here to say this. A no code tool makes the problem harder because the result is occult in nature as well.\n\nThis. Code is the language you use to talk to computers. You still have to know what to *say*\n\nBecause they are fundamentally trying to do something without understanding it. Once you get to the limits of your scope, you cannot understand it anymore, and the tool doesn't help you.\n\nIt's actually no different from someone who uses traditional coding tools trying to go to a deeper level of abstraction. Like a webdev trying to write systems code. To the systems guy, webdev is using a no-code tool to allocate memory, read from the network card, and so on. To a degree it works, but you'll hit a wall at some point due to lack of understanding, and having a nice web framework is not going to help.\n\nBecause they're built for a single use case, which isn't scaling.\n\nI suspect that the people using no code apps are probably not capable of coming up with a design for their present and future data needs.\n\nAnd the no code tool cannot create this itself.",
