  "EnhancedContent": "I'm currently in a data analytics role, and I'm looking forward into breaking into roles like DevOps/SRE/cloud. And need a friend with whom I can make projects, and have a learning journey. I'm looking forward to do this after my office hours.. ie btwn 6pm-12am (IST) ... I need someone to share my projects... Get feedback, help on my projects... And learn.\n\nyou don’t need a partner you need a project with a deadline\n\nstop waiting for some perfect study buddy devops is built on breaking stuff and fixing it under pressure just pick a stack (AWS, Docker, Terraform whatever), clone a real world setup, and deploy it every tool you touch will teach you more than any “collab”\n\ndocument everything push to GitHub ship ugly iterate fast\n\nsomeone might join you later but don’t wait to start\n\n[**NoFluffWisdom Newsletter**](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/Subscribe) has some sharp takes on solo learning, systems, and leveling up without hand-holding worth a peek\n\nI totally accept it! I'm working on my projects and stuff... Just looking for someone so I can make the process even better\n\nThat's not a very thoughtful reply IMO, a bit inconsiderate even. OP is looking for a community or peers, not waiting for someone to start. While I agree that execution is important and waiting for perfect is bad, finding peers can be extremely valuable. Good luck OP! May you break into DevOps successfully soon!\n\nHey count me in! We can make some discord community where we can do some baby hackathons over the weekend in teams. Learn and explore crazy stuff together!!!!\n\nThat would be great! Share the invite link if you have a server\n\nSounds fun, I just finished a full gitops project hosted on gke maybe we can teach each other. Im from GMT+10.\n\nWe have a group of 10 people for this who study daily after office hours.\n\nJust use AI man, ahhh",
