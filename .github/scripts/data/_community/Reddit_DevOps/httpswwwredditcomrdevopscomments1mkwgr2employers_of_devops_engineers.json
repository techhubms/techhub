I like solving problems, learning about new stuff, understanding big systems, helping people, and getting paid pretty well.\n\nYou know what kinda sucks though? There's only certain kinds of employers that hire DevOps Engineers. Sometimes I'll think about who else I could work for, and then I'll be reminded that they don't have my role at that company.\n\nFor example, I live in a small-mid-sized town, far away from any big city. I work remotely. If I wanted to find a job locally I surely could. But it would most likely be as a systems engineer or something and it wouldn't pay nearly as well as what I'm making now.\n\nAnother example, I see some big company that has a reputation for being a good member of the community, doing charitable works, etc. Wouldn't it be neat to work for them? Oh, but they're a traditional retailer. They have IT for sure, but probably not programmers, let alone DevOps.\n\nTo work as a DevOps Engineer you usually have to work for somewhere fairly sizeable and either in a big city or remote for a place in a big city.\n\n# firstworldproblems\n\nCompanies have to reach a size where DevOps (ie: building things properly with automation in mind) is needed. Retailers will rarely need them until X stores (and a NEED to make them change. Most will just throw another engineer at the problem). And yeah, local pay in small/mid cities will always be less.\n\nSo yeah, gotta go to the big city to get the higher salaries and the companies big enough need, prioritize, and even understand DevOps.\n\nBut, if you could solve this - Doing DevOps more locally with local companies - you'll be off to the races.\n\nOMG my hashtag murdered that last line.\n\nAs someone who doesn’t need a full time devops, I struggle with the opposite. I find it difficult finding someone to contract for the work.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nAs someone who did contract DevOps it's hard. Unless I get to only take on clients with the same stack or the clients are A-OK with paying for the learning curve it's such a time suck managing multiple stacks.\n\nBut for a sweet spot of Cloudflare-AWS-Terraform-Postgres-[python|php|go] it's doable for 2-3 clients. 3-5 put me on the breaking point.\n\nI think looking at it as a fractional CTO/Principal Engineer leads to a better outcome but when you need hands on work done and all of a sudden 2+ clients have priority needs the stress is real.\n\nI think Cloudposse and similar firms can only be successful by being so prescriptive.\n\nYeah not everyone’s over engineering a bunch of infra stuff unfortunately lol\n\nOr remote for a remote first company.  That’s my preference, anyway.\n\n> > >\n> but they're a traditional retailer.

Even after joining a bigger company it’s always the same tech stack and tooling with slightly different configurations. So you never really learn about many new technologies compared to being a developer.\n\nHow should you develop yourself when every tech stack is the same at every new employment? Feels like architect or management roles is the only step forward.",
