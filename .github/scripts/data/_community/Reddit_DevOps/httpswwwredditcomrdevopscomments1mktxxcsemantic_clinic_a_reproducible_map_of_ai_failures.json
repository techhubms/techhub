  "EnhancedContent": "I’m publishing the **Semantic Clinic** as the canonical, MIT-licensed index for diagnosing and fixing AI failures with math, not folklore. It is a **model-agnostic, pipeline-aware triage hub** that you can apply to GPT, Claude, Gemini, local LLMs, single agents or multi-agent stacks. The **single source of truth** lives here:\n\n**Semantic Clinic (canonical link):** [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md)\n\n**OCR Legend Tesseract.js Author Starred my repo (WFGY on top now)** [https://github.com/bijection?tab=stars](https://github.com/bijection?tab=stars)\n\n**What it is.**\n\nMost failures are layered: OCR → parsing → chunking → embeddings → vector store → retriever → prompt assembly → LLM reasoning. One upstream distortion hides a downstream hallucination. The Clinic organizes these into reproducible **failure families** (prompting, retrieval/data, reasoning, memory/long-context, multi-agent/orchestration, infra/deploy, evaluation). Each family links to a precise fix page and acceptance criteria. **No prompt tricks, no patchwork**—every remedy is a structural intervention.\n\n**What we’ve shipped.**\n\n- A field-tested **Problem Map** and Clinic that cover the common failure patterns devs actually hit in production (RAG drift, traceability gaps, logic collapse, memory fractures, agent conflicts, bootstrap/deploy deadlocks, etc.).\n- **One-click sandboxes/Colabs** (linked from the Clinic/Problem Map) that run the instruments without installation or private APIs.\n- A thin “TXT OS” operating layer (referenced from the Clinic) so any model can apply the engine with zero install.\n- **Cold start to now:** ~50+ days, ~360 ⭐ from real users; growth driven by issue reports and fixes, not hype. We also maintain a running testimony of field saves: **Hero Log** → [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/discussions/10](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/discussions/10)\n\n**The mathematics (concise spec).** The Clinic is powered by three instruments and four repair operators. You don’t need to memorize the algebra to use them, but the math is public and consistent across pages.\n\n- **ΔS (semantic stress).** A scalar drift signal computed from embedding geometry; we use `ΔS = 1 − cos(I, G)`\nwhere *I* is the current view and *G* is the ground/anchor. Operational thresholds: `<0.40` stable, `0.40–0.60` transitional, `≥0.60` high risk. Probe **question↔retrieved context** and **context↔expected anchor** to localize where meaning tears.\n- **λ\\_observe (layered observability).** A finite-state tag per layer: convergent (→), divergent (←), recursive (&lt;&gt;), chaotic (×). If upstream λ is stable and downstream flips divergent, the fault is at the boundary between those layers.\n- **E\\_resonance (coherence control).** A rolling statistic on residual magnitude under correction; if E rises while ΔS stays high, perform a controlled reset and variance clamp.\n- **Repair operators (WFGY modules).**\n\n- **BBMC** — semantic residue minimization: reduce ‖B‖ with re-grounding and anchor re-specification.\n- **BBPF** — multi-path progression: explore/weight parallel semantic paths to avoid dead ends.\n- **BBCR** — collapse→rebirth control: detect failure at threshold and rebuild a safe bridge node.\n- **BBAM** — attention variance modulation: stabilize attention to prevent entropy melt in long or noisy contexts.\n\n**How you verify fixes.**\n\nKeep it falsifiable. Target ΔS ≤ 0.45 for direct QA after retrieval/prompt corrections; require λ to remain convergent across paraphrases; ensure E\\_resonance does not trend upward over longer windows; make retrieval traceable (cite lines ↔ snippets). If those conditions do not hold, you don’t “tune” more prompts—you change the structure (index metric/normalization, schema lock, bridge nodes, agent boundaries, boot order).\n\n**Reproducibility.** Everything in the Clinic is designed to run with fixed seeds and minimal prerequisites. The Colab tools referenced from the Clinic make the probes and resets observable end-to-end. If you only copy one thing, copy the Clinic link above; it fans out to the families, fixes, and sandboxes.\n\n**Why this belongs in open source.** Open source doesn’t need another glossy “best practices” PDF. It needs an **operational map** you can run in public, verify on your stack, and argue about in issues. The Clinic is that map: math-first, license-clean, reproducible, and written to be forked, critiqued, and extended.\n\nIf this saves you a day in vector-store purgatory or a night chasing phantom jailbreaks, star the repo and drop a note in the **Hero Log**. We read every case because the failure patterns are the dataset.\n\n**Canonical link (again):**\n\n[https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/ProblemMap/SemanticClinicIndex.md)\n\nMIT-licensed.
