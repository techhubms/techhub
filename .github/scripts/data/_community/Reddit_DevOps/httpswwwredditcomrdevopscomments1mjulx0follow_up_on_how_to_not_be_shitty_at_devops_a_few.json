I am happy to say that I landed in a great environment with a great team and good leadership. They didn't pay me to say that, honest! That said, its a hardcore environment and results are important (but in a not at all costs way).\n\nThe first few days where \"OMG What have I done?\" but after that, once all the accounts worked as expected and getting to know the people it turned out to be a very good experience. I \\*thought\\* I knew the tools and tech but it was a whole new level. That said, they have been kind and patient with me and my boss is overflowing with praise because he is getting really good positive feedback from all quarters.\n\nAs for \"oops\" moments, sure I made a few mistakes but haven't taken anything down (yet) but the thing with DevOps is that is why you have multiple environments and when pushing to prod its triple check, dry run, triple check again. You learn how to minimize oops issues.\n\nAs for the pay, yes, it was very worth it. :D\n\nI got headhunted so I cant really advise on getting positions but I am glad I made the jump. If you get the offer, consider it\n\nHell Yeah! Nice job, sounds like you’ve really positioned your self for a solid career and found a good spot to really grow. A supportive team and management make all the difference.\n\nsolid update this is what good onboarding *should* look like supportive team structured prod process and space to make small mistakes without getting nuked\n\ndevops isn’t about never screwing up it’s about building systems where screwing up doesn’t take down the house\n\nalso props for owning the learning curve a lot of people fake confidence and then panic silently you leaned in now you’re leveling up for real\n\nI'm happy for you",
