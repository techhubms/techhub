  "EnhancedContent": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm working on [Infragram](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=infragram.infragram), an architecture diagram generator for terraform. I thought to share it here and gather some early feedback from the community.\n\nIt's packaged as a vscode extension you can install from the marketplace. Once installed, you can generate two types of diagrams:\n\n1. An architecture diagram which is a source representation.\n2. A plan diagram which is a visual representation of your plan diff.\n\nThe diagrams are interactive and allow you to zoom in and out to see varying levels of detail for your infrastructure, a la the [C4 Model](https://c4model.com). Also it runs completely offline, your code never leaves your machine.\n\nI've put together a quick [video](https://youtu.be/npAWvGl8WeM) to demo the concept, if you please.\n\nYou can also see these sample images [1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akulapid/infragram-root/refs/heads/main/assets/aws-clicklogs-ingestion.png), [2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akulapid/infragram-root/refs/heads/main/assets/aws-vpc.png), [3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akulapid/infragram-root/refs/heads/main/assets/google-kubernetes-engine-expaned.png), [4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akulapid/infragram-root/refs/heads/main/assets/azure-cross-region-load-balancer.png) to get an idea of what the diagrams look like.\n\nDo check it out and share your feedback, would love to hear your thoughts.",
