Everything was working fine but recently I started receiving notifications about confirming 2FA which I just skipped but today it stopped me from skipping this pop up and prevented me from accessing my Github profile at all. It keeps asking me to verify \"recently configured two-factor authentication method\" but I didn't received any sort of code on my mobile device which I could enter in there and I don't remember having setup any such specific code for 2FA.\n\nThe \"More options\" button takes me to my profile configuration settings but I am unable to find any sort of authentication code there as well. Although I can see an option there to disable 2FA, I am afraid it might further end up complicating stuff. I tried to find some solution regarding it but couldn't really find any. Anyone knows a solution to this? Should I just disable 2FA?\n\nThe situation described suggests GitHub's 28-day 2FA checkup period may be the cause. During this period, you are prompted to verify your 2FA methods. If a successful 2FA verification is not completed within 28 days, GitHub will require you to perform 2FA within an existing session, and if unable to verify, may prompt you to reconfigure 2FA settings or begin account recovery.\n\nSo if nothing works, atlast removing that 2FA can be the best thing you can do.\n\nThank you so much for the response! I really appreciate it.\n\nFuck the 2FA cargo cult bullshit.\n\nTrue that",
