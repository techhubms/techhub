Most of those tools without installers that require such installation instructions aren’t meant for people who don’t understand those instructions.\n\nIf you want to build a house, you better know how to use the tools.\n\n> > >\n> I don’t know anything about coding\n> > > >\n\nThen, I'm afraid the projects on GitHub really aren't aimed at you. It's not an app store. It's a place for developers to share code with other developers.\n\nIf the developers cared about non-technical end-users, they would set up a website aimed at those people.\n\nThat's not, of course, to say that you can't download and use the software you find on GitHub, but you're in our world now and you need to do a bit of research in order to fit in.\n\nOh, and never run random code from GitHub without understanding it.",
