  "EnhancedContent": "That's a little vague. Ask a question and we'll try to answer it.\n\nokay so how to use github like what's the main purpose ?\n\n- Look around, the Internet is big. Do your own research.\n- Learn how to use Git and GitHub. In that order.\n- Inform yourself about (open source) licenses and open source in general, for example [https://choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com)\n- Be proactive. Don't expect everything to be spoon-fed to you.\n\nCome back if you have specific suggestions. ðŸ™‚\n\nGood luck!\n\nThis. As much as a Do what the fuck you want license can sound good, itâ€™s bad as anyone could use your software and then complain and take you to court for pretty much anything that happens to them or their device. You need a real open-source license for open source, as theyâ€™re used to secure yourself too.\n\nOhh okay thanks\n\nApply for the GitHub student developer pack.",
