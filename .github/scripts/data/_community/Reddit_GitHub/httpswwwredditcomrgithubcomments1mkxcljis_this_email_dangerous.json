Has anyone encountered anything like this?\n\nScam\n\nLooks like someone made an issue designed to look like a security alert email, and then tagged you in that issue. Note at the bottom how it says \"You are receiving this because you were mentioned\". The 'view now' link in the issue body probably points to a malicious website. It seems that the user has already been deleted: [https://github.com/gitdeveloper147-cloud](https://github.com/gitdeveloper147-cloud)\n\nChange your password, donâ€™t click on these links, contact GitHub official support if you are worried.\n\nYou might just have subscribed to a repo.\n\nDon't be that guy",
