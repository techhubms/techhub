Plz recommend me some resources you think is good\n\nThere are plenty of resources.\n\nYou could start by reading the GitHub documentation. I think it has clear steps on what to do. They also have a Quick Start guide.\n\nIt depends on what you prefer. Goggle about git tutorials or beginner's guides. You will many.\n\nHowever, you should start with Git before you learn about GitHub. You can use Git perfectly without GitHub, but not the other way around.\n\nYou learn Git from the standard Git book - [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).\n\nThen you learn GitHub from the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en)\n\n[https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)\n\nIt's better to start with the GitHub official documentation. Also, GitHub skills can be useful:[https://skills.github.com/](https://skills.github.com/) .\n\nfreeCodeCamp's Git & GitHub course on YouTube might be good as well.\n\nAlso, it's nice to learn about security from the beginning, this article might be a good start: [https://gitprotect.io/blog/github-security-best-practices-15-tips-to-keep-in-mind/](https://gitprotect.io/blog/github-security-best-practices-15-tips-to-keep-in-mind/)",
