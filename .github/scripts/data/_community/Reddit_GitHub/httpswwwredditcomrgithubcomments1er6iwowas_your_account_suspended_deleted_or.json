And I wouldn‚Äôt prioritise anyone, in part for fairness to everyone else who‚Äôs patiently waiting their turn, even if I‚Äôve seen their plea here. So yeah posting here won‚Äôt help.\n\nThat said, should some *random staff member* be perusing this thread, I know they definitely won‚Äôt be able to secretly and anonymously help you out if you don't mention your username in those details. üòå\n\nETA: Please don't send me DMs or mention me in this thread. It will not help your case.\n\nGive me the exe to fix it and i‚Äôll stop posting\n\nIt's so weird how many people are having the same issue. Are people getting mass reported then false banned?\n\nMy GitHub (Stefanuk12) was suspended on the 18th of October shortly after I uploaded a repository. Prior to that, a month ago I applied for the GitHub education and a few hours before my suspension, I got an email saying it was denied for some reason. I made a ticket on the same day (ID: 3056015) and haven't heard back since.\n\nI've migrated all my public repositories to GitLab for now. Hopefully they get back to me soon ü§û\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I got no email informing me of my ban or reason at all too.\n\nEdit 2: I'm unsuspended a day after posting this :)\n\nY‚Äôall, if you don‚Äôt leave your account name GitHub Claus can never even try to help you.\n\nGitHub Student Account \"brundunn\" got locked last night after I was starring repos for Lua learning. Just applied for a reinstatement. I received a mail that GitHub was unable to verify my academic affiliation submitted on Dec 18 2023, while I understand that I need to re-enter my information for the next year. I find it unfair that I had not received any notification that I needed to verify my student information. I would've done it if I could just log back in.\n\nmy account \"splyfof\" was suspended for \"Your account was suspended following reports that it was used to host and distribute malware.\"\n\nthis is not something i have done on github so i wrote to them and got the ticket number \"3108628\"\n\nsupport hasn't been helpful in reinstatement\n\nI really hope someone sees this.\n\nMy GitHub account ‚Äúoldvisions‚Äù was randomly suspended for no reason and with no warning. I have also submitted a ticket, and my ticket ID is ‚Äú3166443‚Äù.\n\nI honestly have no idea what I did wrong if anything and was suspended for violating the TOS. All I use my account for is finding random cool stuff and forking it as my way to bookmark stuff, not sure if that is a wrong way to do things. I‚Äôm not a developer nor do I have any coding knowledge, so I rely on AI coding assistants.\n\nHence, if I did something wrong or used the service incorrectly, I apologize, and could‚Äôve been due to lack of understanding what I‚Äôm doing to a fuller extent.\n\nAlthough, to my knowledge, I haven‚Äôt done anything in recent memory that I think could have actually went against the TOS, because all I do is fork cool stuff and upload private repos for whatever my AI code assistant makes me.\n\nBut due to my lack of coding knowledge, I can‚Äôt easily redevelop all of the personal projects that were on there, and I had probably thousands of dollars in AI API costs worth of coded projects on there. If I did do something wrong, I am more than happy to fix whatever it was and never do it again.\n\nThank you for your time if you see this, and I hope I can get my account back, so I can actually start learning to code like I planned, and have somewhere to store my code.\n\nEdit: Also, I was having my AI develop me a crypto arbitrage trading bot (ethical one), but deep in the development of it, I had also heard about MEV trading bots, not knowing even how they work, but just knowing I heard they make a lot of money.\n\nSo I found every MEV bot public repo and forked them into my account (my way of bookmarking). So I could look at them and try to see what my non developer mind can figure out to get ideas, and after more research, I realized that most MEV bots, aside from like one variant using arbitrage (which to my knowledge helps the Solana ecosystem through balancing out liquidity pools), are seriously unethical, and clarified perfectly how I always seemed to get screwed when trying to buy pretty much any meme coin. Which is definitely not what I‚Äôve been building.\n\nSo forking all of those repos to my account could have been what caused the automated suspension.\n\nOr, I also started looking into MCP servers for Claude 3.5 Sonnet (LLM/AI Model), and I had one of my AI coding assistants code me an MCP server for managing my GitHub (using a personal access token) and also looking through GitHub for up to data versions of software to integrate into my project.\n\nI had tested that MCP server yesterday with the Claude AI desktop app to see if I can turn it into the ultimate AI coding tool (which worked and is insane), and it used the GitHub MCP server to search for updated versions of some software it was using for my code, because there were some errors.\n\nSo maybe it abused the access token or something and got me marked as trying to abuse the platform? I really hope not though, cause now I‚Äôll be scared to have Claude make any MCP server to connect to a service.\n\nI also tested out GitHub Copilot Workspace to see if it could help me fix the code on my bot, because these AI‚Äôs have horrifying memory, and I think they made multiple duplicates of multiple feature functions or whatever devs call it. Making the entire thing useless until the codebase is cleaned up.\n\nReason I mention this is because as I was scrolling down this post, I saw someone mention something about there‚Äôs two things GitHub hates, and I forgot the first thing, but the second was something like running crypto mining bots on GitHub.\n\nBut to my knowledge, I‚Äôve never ran this bot on Codespaces, I may have imported it, but never turned it on, cause it was impossible anyways. I was probably only creating a Codespaces with my repo to try to have a way to manage my project when I am not home, cause my ADHD be like that.\n\nOr, since Copilot Workspace uses Codespaces (I think), maybe when I imported my bot project there and asked for help, that‚Äôs where it could‚Äôve tried actually running the bot?\n\nIf so, I had no idea, and never once intended to even attempt to try hosting a trading bot on GitHub. Mainly because it‚Äôs not made for that, and bots need the fastest servers.\n\nThat‚Äôs basically my entire GitHub history for the last 2-5 months.\n\nMaybe I just got way too ahead of myself being enamored by AI coding and seeing if it can help me build something cool, and that cause this.\n\nOr it was just some random bug and none of anything I said has to do with why I was suspended, and I typed an entire descriptive novel with 500 chapters for no reason.\n\nBut I want to be as descriptive as possible with exactly everything I have been doing, just incase a magical super hero GitHub employee stumbles upon this nonsensical masterpiece clusterfuck of a post lol.\n\nSo I‚Äôm more than happy to fix whatever I did wrong and not do it again, and apologize for my lack of know how and proper understanding of things, if that‚Äôs what lead to doing something without knowing it was against TOS, or unknowingly letting Claude AI perform actions through my access token without more properly monitoring them. Even though I don‚Äôt know how, but I‚Äôll learn.\n\nEdit 2: I just remembered one final thing, and it was probably the last action taken on my GitHub account. Through worries about these AI‚Äôs integrating or using potentially malicious software or code, I found Socket.dev (which scans for anything bad) and installed its plugin to my GitHub. Could it have potentially found something malicious in one of the repos I forked of even in my private repos that were made by AI, and proceeded to report it to GitHub, essentially getting me suspended?\n\nPS: Yes, I know my paragraph spacing and excessive of run on sentences is annoying. But my ADHD has my brain moving faster than the expansion speed of the universe, and I have to just type one giant block and just fix later, or have Chat GPT fix it for me lol.\n\n04.01.2025 It seems like people are actually getting help from posts in this thread. I'll try it too.\n\nThree days ago my account was deleted without any reason. I still haven't received a response from support. Ticket ID - 3166952, username - GREAT-DNG.\n\nI hope someone from the GitHub team can help.\n\n07.02.2025 Finally got access to the account, but now it's shadowbanned. Will write to support again.\n\n18.02.2025 After a month and a half, my account is fully restored. Only the subscribers were reset, but it doesn't matter.\n\nDon't lose hope, your account will be restored sooner or later, good luck.",
