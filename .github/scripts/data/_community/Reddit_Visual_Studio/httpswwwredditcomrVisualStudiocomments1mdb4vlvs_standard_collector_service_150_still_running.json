Sounds like you are actively programming now!\n\nNo, just end the process in task manager and re-try.\n\nI let the installer kill and restart it.\n\nMy concern is that I've done dozens of VS updates over the years and never seen this warning. Is it a new service that hasn't yet been properly integrated into the update process?",
