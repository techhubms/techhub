This is basically my first experience with actual coding and Visual Studio and I want to align this label to centre. I select anchor top, left, right but its not anchoring to the centre horizontally. its fine at the default windows size but it just stays at the location defined in Location, 253, 31. How to I make this relocate dynamic to window size? Its probably a dumb answer and I acknowledge that. Also keep in mind I have very little experience with VS and VB\n\nAnchor just places the label object(UserControl). You also want to change the Text in that Control in that case with the Property TextAlignment to TopCenter or what you need :)\n\nYou also should use Dock cause the Label Control will automatically get resized through docking (it wont through setting anchors)\n\nGo and read more about dock, anchor and maybe you are also looking for the TableLayoutPanel.\n\nI set TextAlign to TopCentre. It didnt move at all. I tried other ones too like MiddleRight and it stayed in the same position\n\nPlease do post a screenshot (use ScreenToGif), not a (shaky) video.\n\nBy the way, you should post that in [r/dotnet](/r/dotnet/) or [r/visualbasic](/r/visualbasic/) since thats not an visualstudio topic, but a vb.net winforms one ;)\n\nThey're teaching you Visual Basic, Winforms, on .Net Framework 4.7, in 2025?\n\nIf you're paying for this, I'd find a different school. This is like hiring a driving instructor and he pulls up with a horse drawn carriage and tells you that you can only use an ox to pull it with.\n\nGood luck on this. I'd ask on a visual basic specific sub, this sub is for the Visual Studio IDE and the combination of technologies that you're using isn't very common any more. I'd guess the vast majority of people on here won't be able to do more than guess at your question.\n\nI know I hate it. Its college, which in UK is government funded and icba to move. Its not entirely useless but yeah.",
