  "EnhancedContent": "One of the main reasons I quit using visual studio was because they refused to fix an intellisense issue with deep relationships in ef core and postgresql. It works in vs code and rider, but not visual studio. After 3 levels of relationships, intellisense would die and no longer work. I reported it, but because it only had 3 upvotes, they wouldn't fix it because it didn't impact enough people.\n\nI also had a similar issue imto that thread of trying to get someone to actually acknowledge it as a bug. They kept saying they couldn't reproduce it. When they finally admitted they could it made me wonder if they even tried to in the first place.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that makes me wonder what the hell Microsoft is doing all day.\n\nMicromanaging useless features\n\nCoPilot. Theyâ€™re doing CoPilot. So cool.\n\nAfter seeing this behavior for years, I'm sure that you can only get issues fixed if you have a personal connection to MS.\n\nI got more bugs in VS and Windows fixed by pestering right people on X, than by only reporting them on FeedbackHub or DevCommunity.\n\nIt could be worse. For example, [MySQL Bug #11472](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=11472) has been open for 20 years and 1 month now.\n\nThis is hilarious. But we all need to attack Microsoft the way this guy is.\n\nAt this point itâ€™s probably easier to simply remove the checkbox and call the bug a feature.\n\nThere's dozens of bugs in Visual Studio you'll hit every day. It's disappointing.",
