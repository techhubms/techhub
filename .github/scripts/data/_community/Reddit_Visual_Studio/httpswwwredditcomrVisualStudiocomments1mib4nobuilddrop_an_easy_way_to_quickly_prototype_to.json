  "Description": "I've built an extremely simple build tool that uses TCP over your network to deploy builds to devices.\n\nI built it after I got annoyed with the old workflow I had with using file shares, and it just works. We have some devices we use for our in-house software, and testing those devices by using our Auto updater just takes too long to prototype changes quickly, as it has to download the entire update instead of just transferring the updated executable.\n\nIt can easily be expanded to actually transfer reference dependencies and more. We have separate applications utilized by the main executable, mainly for activation and for offline access, so expect updates to allow more files to be transferred other than the main executable.\n\nLet me know what you think, any alternatives you use, and if I am just going about this plain wrong.",
