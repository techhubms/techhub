  "Description": "Hello. I came here for help on how to solve the JIT debugging problem.\n\nI´m trying to use a program (CreationMaster 16 to use mods on Fifa16) but every time I try to use it it shows this problem message. I´ve tried to do every YT tutorial on how to solve it with windows cofiguration or deleting somethings in the regedit, etc., but didn´t work.\n\nMonths ago I got the same problem but I can´t remember how I solved it by just installing (I guess) some directX dependences from some specific year or some other thing, nonetheless this time it didn´t work or maybe I did something different.\n\nI even downloaded VisualStudio (I don´t code) and activate the debugging in the tool/options menu but didn´t work either.\n\nThe message says something about modify some windows forms of the application but I don´t know how to find those forms to modify them.\n\nHelp please. I include some images with the windows message I get every time\n\n(redirection with the correct sub for this problem will be highly appreciated since I´m a bit lost)\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/bek80x0o46gf1.jpg?width=446&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e10b936d5b25430e554c43be6cf67b10a3cd3dad](https://preview.redd.it/bek80x0o46gf1.jpg?width=446&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e10b936d5b25430e554c43be6cf67b10a3cd3dad)\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/61krxzgn46gf1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc37dbab1f39945e3caff84f685c6b87bb0114e0](https://preview.redd.it/61krxzgn46gf1.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc37dbab1f39945e3caff84f685c6b87bb0114e0)",

And the official documents say that there's an extra step if the app is a C++ app too if that applies to you.",
