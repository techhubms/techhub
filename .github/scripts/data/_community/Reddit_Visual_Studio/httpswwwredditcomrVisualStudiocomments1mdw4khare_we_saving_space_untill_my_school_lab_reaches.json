Maybe you don't use it yet because you haven't learned how, but if you disable it, how will you learn?\n\nBy the way, debugging is very important.\n\nI know and I've used it, to a minor extent. However I'd much rather just have line numbers ONLY, then a toggle to enable a bit of space for the red dotties.\n\nEspecially the space to the right of the line numbers feels useless.\n\nThey assume everyone is on an ultrawide monitor these days. Part of the problem is those are also buttons for setting debug points.\n\nI legit disabled the debug points so right now it's just ✨space✨",
