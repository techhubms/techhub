  "Description": "Hi guys,\n\nSo, as the title said, I'm switching from Clion to vs 2022, as a C++ beginner. But, it takes a lot of time to get used to it. I hate that VS 2022 doesnt have a function that clion has: For ex, if i type cout in Clion and press Tab, it gives me std::cout. In vs, I have to type std:: and I'm too lazy to do thatðŸ˜†. Anyways, is there a setting I can change to have that function on Vs 2022? And what other settings do you like to change from default?",
