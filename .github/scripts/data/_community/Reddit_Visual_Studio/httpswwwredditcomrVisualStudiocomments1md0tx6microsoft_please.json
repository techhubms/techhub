Bothering with the chaos of Linux DEs? Forget about it.\n\nI think the biggest issue with porting win32/WinForms to Linux is the whole distro fragmentation, this challenge pertains to porting any Windows app not VS particularly. For example, should I optimize it for Gtk+ or Qt, X.org or wayland, Ubuntu or Fedora or OpenSuse? A whole lot of useful apps would have been ported already and seamlessly if Linux world had followed some standards for userland graphics or stuck to just one or two mainstream distros.\n\n> > >\n> if Linux world had followed some standards for userland *[anything]*\n> > > >\n\nAlas, never gonna happen.\n\nThe best hope was Visual Studio for MacOS and that’s already been killed…\n\nI have yet to meet a single person developing on Linux that said \"man, if only I could use visual studio\"???\n\nJust switch to VS Code. I resisted for a long time. With the newest C# extensions and the Solution Explorer view, it's never been more like Visual Studio. Different, but bearable.\n\nDon’t know why this is being voted down. I don’t see how a Visual Studio for Linux would have more features than a VS Code today. VS is only so powerful because it’s highly integrated with Windows.\n\nPersonally I'd perfer MS actually supported F# properly in VS (it's what I use for my job).",
