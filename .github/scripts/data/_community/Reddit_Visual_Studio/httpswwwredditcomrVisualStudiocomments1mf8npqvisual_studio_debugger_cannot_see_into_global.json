  "Description": "I'm trying to debug something in my code, but for whatever reason, the Visual Studio debugger will not show any information about the members of a struct. For example, if I do `Debug.Print state` from the command window (`state` is the name of said struct), I just get a blank line. If I put it in a watch, it doesn't have any dropdowns. If I put one of it's members as a watch, e.g. `state.evenRf` , I get \"unrecognized token\". The struct is declared in the file `state.c` , with an `extern STATE state;` in `state.h` . `STATE` is a typedef'd `struct state` . See the below image which showcases some of the things I mentioned.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/nq4mo8gd5hgf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=62025149a8e26178d4d14e09a0b9cfacfe8cbdd3](https://preview.redd.it/nq4mo8gd5hgf1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=62025149a8e26178d4d14e09a0b9cfacfe8cbdd3)\n\nHas anyone had this issue? The code compiles fine, and the program can access the members of `state` . Also, I tried CLion, which uses lldb for it's debugger, and it could see the members of the struct just fine. I couldn't find much online about the \"unrecognized token\" error in regards to the watch window unfortunately. Did I catch some obscure bug in the debugger, or is this some sort of configuration issue? I can inspect the value of global scalar variables, so it's either just global structs in general, or only this specific one. I also checked what happens if you use the LLVM toolchain, but it didn't help. I tried reinstalling Visual Studio, recreating the project, resetting the settings, but it's still doing it.\n\nEDIT: I did some more experiments and it looks like the issue is that Visual Studio gets really confused when there is both a `struct state` and an actual object called `state` . Changing the struct name, but still typedefing it to `STATE` seems to fix it? Very strange.",

You should [report a problem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio?view=vs-2022).\n\nYeah I did a small experiment in a new project and the issue is definitely that the names are the same. I'll report it when I get home if I don't forget lol",
