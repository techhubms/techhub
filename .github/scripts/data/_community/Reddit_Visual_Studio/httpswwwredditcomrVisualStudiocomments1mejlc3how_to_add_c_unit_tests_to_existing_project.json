  "Description": "So I'm trying to add unit tests to a project I'm working on. However, all the sources I've found are somewhat unhelpful. They're all telling me to start a new project or something, but wouldn't that just complicate things beyond what they need to be?\n\nI've used unit tests before (Gradle/Kotlin with Java), and I'm rather comfortable with writing the tests themselves. However, regarding setup itself, it was on its own, not integrated with Visual Studio, and I had the help of a friend to set it up. As such, I'm a bit lost.\n\nWhat all do I need to know about how to set this all up? Can I do it without changing too much, or do I need to start over with a new project, or add a new project, or what? What even am I supposed to be doing?",

When you write unit tests for C++ code in VS, it means to add unit test project into solution with your project, then link the code (classes, functions) you want to test to the unit test project and write tests for them.\n\nThe tests are built as separate exe (google test) or dll (ms test) which is then executed in test environment.\n\nMy usual setup is to have a lib project with the code, project for dll/exe which has the lib linked to build the resulting binary and third project for unit tests which links the same lib. Then you have the code in single place and either use it in resulting binary or in unit test.\n\nNote: The above is simplified approach description. I work on big code base with multiple libraries, dlls and exes at work so having the \"units\" separated in libraries is natural. But the principle holds.\n\nYou can have the same cpp and h files added to resulting binary and unit test, but I consider the lib approach much cleaner.\n\nThanks!",
