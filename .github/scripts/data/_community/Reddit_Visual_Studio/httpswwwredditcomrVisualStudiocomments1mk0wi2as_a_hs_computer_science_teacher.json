  "EnhancedContent": "I have been using VS to teach Computer Science to high school students for over 25 years, all the way back to the days of VS6. While my first year course uses a different IDE for Python and my third year course is AP, teaching Java, I currently use VS to teach Visual BASIC and C/C++\n\nIf anyone at Microsoft is reading this, I beg you to come up with a “clean” version of VS meant for education which doesn’t include AI. Hell, I don’t even like the beginning students using Intellisense until they know what they’re doing.\n\nHaving to start the year telling all of my students to *not* enable any of the AI features? Yeahhhhhh.\n\nI used to do corporate training with Java. The first day (6 or so hours), we would only use Notepad and the command prompt to compile and run. I wouldn't teach them anything else. The 2nd day, we would start out learning Eclipse and we'd be working in that the rest of the time.\n\nKids aren't as accommodating as adults though.\n\nI think you can open the installer and uninstall Copilot. That doesn't keep the students from reinstalling it, but it's not a switch you can just turn on. I agree that for people just learning, Intellisense is not a good thing.\n\nIf you are using VS (not VS Code), and your students are using school computers, your license may let you define an exclusion for Copilot. You would use a Group Policy template that would block Copilot on the latest version of VS 2022.\n\nIt's documented here\n\n[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-admin?view=vs-2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-admin?view=vs-2022)\n\nThis is such a helpful post, thank you. I’ll share it with our IT team to see if we can push it out. Thank you so much.\n\nIt is possible to turn off Copilot in VS and you can also uninstall the feature I believe.\n\nBorland C++ 4.5 VB6\n\nBringing back those memories.\n\nHonestly, it's probably related to how VS Code has become so much more popular than VS IDE, and because MS/GitHub's [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is meant to handle this problem (that's what Harvard uses, for example).\n\nYou create a Codespace that all your students can use/access (without having to install anything), and you can configure it however you'd like (with no AI features at all).\n\nIt's more expensive than having them install locally, something like $80 per 150 students per 7 days a week, per 45 minutes a day (if class is daily). But its also pretty awesome if it fits your budget.\n\nAlternatively, you can always try[VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium). If the newer versions have any AI integrated directly into the UI, just use an earlier version (although, you could do that with VSCode and VS IDE too). There's very little that VS Code can't do these days (you just use extensions to turn it into whatever IDE you want).\n\nWhy not teach them how to USE the AI, how to write good prompts, then how to fix the AI's hallucinations when the code it generates explodes? A lot of employers these days are mandating the use of Copilot, Claude and/or Cursor.\n\nI think the issue is that kids don't understand that they need to learn how to do things, not just asking AI for the answers. I agree that they should be taught how to do it, but if the IDE is saying \"here's the code it seems like you're needing\", is a high schooler really going to say \"nah, I really need to do this myself\"? Programming, like anything else, needs hands-on, manual grinding. You're not going to learn anything by having AI do it all for you.\n\nBecause they need to learn the programming language first if they want to understand literally anything.\n\nAI is fine with experience, but AI will create students who cannot brute force fizz buzz.",
