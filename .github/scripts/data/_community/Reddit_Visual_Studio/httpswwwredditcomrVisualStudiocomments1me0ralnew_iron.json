I will be running multiple instances of the ide occasionally.\n\nAny suggestions on what minimum spec I should be looking for?\n\nThanks :)\n\n[https://frame.work](https://frame.work) 13‚Äù, maxed out specs. Its not even close. Having owned laptops since forever, this is *the* laptop for vs developers.\n\nLots of ram....\n\nPlease define lots?\n\nDepends on number of projects per solution.i would say 32gb. Also a fast hard-drive will help a lot.\n\nWhat?! I have 256 and I am constantly swapping\n\nHey [u/solhar](/user/solhar/), Dave here from the Visual Studio team. Performance is my job, so I can help with the recommendations here.\n\nWe're working on the [next version of Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-v17-14-is-now-generally-available/#delivering-new-features-in-visual-studio-even-faster), and while we intend for it to be faster on the same hardware as VS 2022, the more RAM and logical CPUs you give Visual Studio the better. Also buy the fastest SSD you can afford.\n\nUnlike prior versions, the next version of Visual Studio will dynamically change its behavior based on hardware. 16 logical CPUs\\* + 64 GB will give you the sweet spot between performance and cost.\n\nWhile less CPUs/RAM will still perform pretty well, we do reduce our memory usage to avoid overwhelming the system, which will result in slower performance.\n\n\\* By logical CPUs here, I'm including hyperthreaded cores, so 8 hyperthreaded cores would be be 16 logical CPUs.\n\nDavid Kean Visual Studio team\n\nWhat do you do?\n\nLike if you are a game dev, no laptop is good really. Some can be used if you are on vacation of something, but daily dev is a no go\n\nditch Visual Studio and get Rider on a mac. Its the best.",
