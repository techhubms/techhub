  "Description": "Hello, I am trying to find the best solution for DevOps for our teams.\n\nWe have a PMO with project managers, creating projects with tasks that are assigned to technical team.\n\nThese same technical teams have backlogs of operational tasks, sent to them via our ITSM system.\n\nWe want one place/board for the technical teams to manage all tasks from both operational and projects. The ITSM system can feed the tasks into the team board via API, they will also add in some ad-hoc tasks to their backlog that they need to do, like updates etc, direct to the team plan.\n\nHow do we set projects up to feed tasks into the same team boards, but still have a project view? The projects will be feeding multiple technical teams with tasks and there will be tasks specifically for the none technical project team that will just stay within the \"project view\", not in the technical teams.\n\nI appreciate the word Project in this case can mean two things, an actual project from the PMO and within DevOps a Project within the organisation structure. When I say project above I am meaning from a PMO sense, not a DevOps one.\n\nDoes that make sense?",

Would this allow different hierarchical teams to view different cross sections of tasks, based on what they need to see. So project manager see their project, team member sees the tasks assigned to them (regardless of project or if its direct to their team)?",
