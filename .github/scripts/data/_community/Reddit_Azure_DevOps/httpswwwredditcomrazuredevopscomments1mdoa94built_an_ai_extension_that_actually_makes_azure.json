Would love feedback if you try it.\n\nWe are using Azure (git, pipelines etc) in combination with Jira. Does this tool support this combination, or can the automatic issue creation be disabled and perhaps saved as a PR recommendation?\n\nI’m also very curious about how the PR is processed. We have 500 kloc, distributed over a lot of HAL target projects, several common library projects and a collection of HAL header only projects to tie it together. Projects are Eclipse projects, all in a monorepo, as they all compile down to the same family of embedded devices, that all are tested on the same HiL.\n\nWould this AI reviewer have insight enough into the existing code to be capable to detect discrepancies between two HAL target implementations, and to recommend code to be moved from specific HAL targets to the common libraries? And also be able to abstract usage of one BSP in one HAL target to another BSP in another HAL target.\n\nIs there a manual method to simulate this app, to try some actual PR’s in parallel with our regular review process, to see how it performs?\n\nGreat questions & insight ! Let me address each part:\n\n**Azure + Jira combination:** Currently the extension is designed specifically for Azure DevOps work items, so it wouldn't integrate with Jira out of the box. You are spot on - we're planning to add granular feature controls in the Settings where you can enable/disable specific features like:\n\n- Chat functionality\n- PR Review\n- Automatic work item creation\n\nSo you could disable the work item creation and just use the PR review recommendations without any Azure Boards integration.\n\n**Regarding your complex embedded architecture:** Your setup sounds fascinating but honestly, the current AI implementation likely **cannot** do the sophisticated cross-project architectural analysis you're describing. Here's why:\n\n- The AI analyzes PRs in isolation, not with full codebase context, this way we can stay within context window of the Models & provide meaningful recomendations on PR in question.\n- Hence, It doesn't have deep understanding of your embedded systems architecture patterns\n- Token limits would make analyzing 500k LOC relationships challenging\n\nIt would catch basic issues (security vulnerabilities, code smells, potential bugs) but probably wouldn't have the deep codebase context needed for suggesting HAL target consolidation or BSP abstraction recommendations.\n\n**Manual simulation:** Absolutely! That's exactly what I'd recommend. You could test it on some representative PRs alongside your regular review process to see what value it provides for your specific use case. The extension works read-only, so there's no risk to your existing workflow. In addition, the extension have seperate UI from your existing Azure Repo PR UI, that helps your parallel try-out.\n\nFeel free to reach out at [support@aidevex.com](mailto:support@aidevx.com) if you want to discuss your specific setup or have other questions during installation or set up !\n\nHey this is really cool",
