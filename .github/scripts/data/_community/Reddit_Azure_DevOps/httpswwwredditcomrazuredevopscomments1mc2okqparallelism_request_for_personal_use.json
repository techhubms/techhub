  "Description": "Hey there,\n\nI am not being granted the parallelism request for my organization. I suppose the issue is that my Azure tenant is based on a personal Microsoft Account, so all user addresses look something like [user@personalemail.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:user@personalemail.onmicrosoft.com). Is there a way to get the free parallelism granted for personal use? I looked into purchasing but it is close to 40$ per month for a single job, which seems somewhat pricey for playing around.",

Really can’t install the agent on your machine if you’re just playing around? Or get a cheap VM in DigitalOcean?\n\nsorry, but I don't really know my way around here, so I don't know how to install agents on my machine or how to setup a VM. I only know that at work I filled´out [this form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR5zsR558741CrNi6q8iTpANURUhKMVA3WE4wMFhHRExTVlpET1BEMlZSTCQlQCN0PWcu&amp;route=shorturl) and got granted free minutes per month. Tried the same thing at home with a organisation hosted in my personal azure tenant and I have never been granted these free minutes.",
