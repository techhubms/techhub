  "EnhancedContent": "Hi everyone, I have questions regarding Azure DevOps Backlog View.\n\n1. Closed Work Items in ADO Backlogs\n\nIn the past, it was possible to close Epics, Features, or User Stories, and still see them on their respective board levels. For example, if I closed an Epic, it would still appear on the Epics board level, as long as I had the \"Show closed work items\" option enabled. The same applied to Features and User Stories on their respective board levels.\n\nHowever, it seems that this behavior has changed. Now, when I close an Epic, it disappears from the Epics board level entirely. The same goes for Features and User Stories — once closed, they no longer show up on their respective board levels, there is no setting to enable visibility . The only way I can still see a closed Feature, for example, is if its parent Epic or child User Stories are still open, the „Parents“ or „completed child Items“ Options are enabled , and the backlog is set to Epic or User Story Level.\n\nOtherwise I wont find the closed Feature on the backlog and I need to change to the Board View or Sprint View, where I wont get a full hierarchie view.\n\nIs there any way to bring back the old behavior, or configure the board to show closed work items directly on the Epic, Feature, or User Story levels again?\n\n[!\\[r/azuredevops - DEVOPS backlog questions\\](https://preview.redd.it/devops-backlog-questions-v0-gku3pun0q7gf1.png?width=215&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8112e7ce42323ed71ba96ca1188dad905a5b9b2d)](https://preview.redd.it/devops-backlog-questions-v0-gku3pun0q7gf1.png?width=215&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8112e7ce42323ed71ba96ca1188dad905a5b9b2d)\n\n2. Iterations per Team in ADO Backlogs\n\nLet’s say I assign a specific iteration to a team in the „team configuration for iterations“ — without setting any permissions — and this team is supposed to only work within that specific iteration.\n\nFor example: I have an Epic assigned to that iteration, and under that Epic, there are multiple Features. Some of these Features are in the same iteration as the Epic, while others are assigned to completely different iterations.\n\nWhat I would expect is that, when the team views the Backlog for their assigned iteration path, which I set in the Team configuration, the backlog is set to EPIC level, they only see this Epic and the Features that also belong to that iteration.\n\nBut instead, they can see the full hierarchy — meaning they see the Epic, the Feature that's in the correct iteration, but also all the other Features that belong to different iterations, although I only assigned this specific iteration to this team and to no other team.\n\nDoes the backlog background mechanism for „get children“ beats the iteration configuration of the team?\n\nThank you in advance.",
