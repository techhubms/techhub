Technically, the version that represents the merge between the two branches.\n\nYou can test this easily yourself by having a script task that prints \"foo\" in main and changing it to print \"bar\" in a PR and looking at the output.\n\nThe first poster is correct. Bigger question I'm thinking of whether a pipeline YAML file change should trigger a pipeline to fire. Typically, I exclude the `.azuredevops` folder from triggers so this doesn't happen.",
