Top voted projects will be featured in our weekly [newsletter](http://ai-agents-weekly.beehiiv.com).\n\nThank you for your submission, for any questions regarding AI, please check out our wiki at [https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki) (this is currently in test and we are actively adding to the wiki)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/AI_Agents) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nPromptropy - A lightweight prompt compression API that dynamically strips and reorders tokens to reduce context length, slash input token costs, and speed up inference. All while maintaining or even improving response quality. If you're building a chatbot, summarization tool, or some other input heavy LLM app, check us out here: [https://www.promptropy.com](https://www.promptropy.com)\n\nReddit Analyzer - A python script to analyze reddit posts, to find the pain points and potential business opportunities. Free, OpenSource.\n\nThe full report contains:\n\n1. Key Pain Points and Problems\n2. Unmet Needs & Feature Requests\n3. Concrete Product & SaaS Ideas\n4. Target Audience Insights\n5. Monetization Potential\n6. Recurring Themes & Positive Sentiments\n7. Competitive Landscape & Existing Solutions\n\nlink: [https://github.com/harshkhokhariya/Reddit_Analyzer](https://github.com/harshkhokhariya/Reddit_Analyzer)\n\nThank You!\n\nI'm working on Tab'd, a GitHub Copilot / Windsurf / Kiro extension which tracks and visualizes AI-assisted coding and copy-paste operations in codebases, and optionally shares that metadata with teams to help maintain accountability.\n\nTab'd shows detailed metadata about AI edits and clipboard origins, and allows users to distribute that metadata within code repositories. If present, a browser extension can highlight these edits during GitHub PR review online or within the IDE.\n\n[https://github.com/iann0036/tabd](https://github.com/iann0036/tabd)\n\nEval Protocol - an [open specification](https://evalprotocol.io/specification), [Python SDK](https://github.com/eval-protocol/python-sdk), pytest wrapper, and [UI](https://evalprotocol.io/tutorial/reviewing-evals-ui) that provides a standardized way to write evaluations for large language model (LLM) applications. Start with simple single-turn evals for model selection and prompt engineering, then scale up to complex multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) for agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP). EP ensures consistent patterns for writing evals, storing traces, and saving results—enabling you to build sophisticated agent evaluations that work across real-world scenarios, from markdown generation tasks to customer service agents with tool calling capabilities.\n\n[https://evalprotocol.io/introduction](https://evalprotocol.io/introduction)\n\nThe AI Thumbnail Generator and not only: [https://thumbnailpilot.com](https://thumbnailpilot.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reply)\n\nMCP Jina Web Search - Open-source Streamable HTTP Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives Claude (and other MCP clients like LM Studio) the ability to search the web and fetch content from any URL using Jina AI's service. A simple, lightweight solution that uses the official MCP python sdk. You can run it locally with Python or Docker. Hope it helps you with your agentic workflows.\n\n[https://github.com/hypersniper05/JinaWebSearchMCP](https://github.com/hypersniper05/JinaWebSearchMCP)",
