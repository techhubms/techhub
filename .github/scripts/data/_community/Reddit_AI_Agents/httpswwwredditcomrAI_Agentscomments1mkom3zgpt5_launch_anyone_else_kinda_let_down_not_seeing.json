  "EnhancedContent": "Watched the GPT-5 launch and… idk, maybe my expectations were too high? Was really hoping for a *massive* step up, but it just doesn’t hit that “next level” vibe. Anyone else feel like it’s more incremental than groundbreaking?\n\nYeah, I feel the same. Was expecting more of a \"wow\" factor, like we saw going from GPT-3 to GPT-4. GPT-5 (or whatever version this actually is) feels more like an iterative improvement faster, more multimodal, better at following instructions but not necessarily a huge leap in reasoning or creativity.\n\nI’m just kinda relieved that I’m still relevant\n\nThe law of diminishing returns.\n\nHey, just like when a new microprocessor came out. Lil faster, yep. New feature or two, yep. Does basically the same thing, yep.\n\nYou gotta understand clusters to know how big it is frfr .. skill diff\n\nFair enough—maybe I need to look into the \"clusters\" stuff more. But so far, it just doesn’t feel like that big a leap. Fingers crossed it grows on me! Thanks though.\n\nThat’s a you issue\n\nThank you for your submission, for any questions regarding AI, please check out our wiki at [https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki) (this is currently in test and we are actively adding to the wiki)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/AI_Agents) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nSame here—the demo sizzle was light, but the upgrades feel more “compound interest” than fireworks. If it really cuts hallucinations, improves tool use, and widens context at lower latency/cost, that’s the stuff that quietly unlocks new workflows even if it’s not flashy. I’m waiting to judge it after a week in production rather than on-stage prompts—big leaps usually show up as fewer hacks needed, not mind-blowing one-offs\n\nAt the moment, at least in Azure, it is objectively worse for many scenarios because it doesn't do parallel tool calling.",
