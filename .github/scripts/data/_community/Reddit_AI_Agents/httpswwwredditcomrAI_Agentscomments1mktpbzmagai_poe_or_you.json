  "EnhancedContent": "Hello, I did the free Gemini trial last month and really enjoyed it. I am looking for an all-in-one like Magai, Poe, or You that I can access certain LLMs depending on the purpose of my prompt.\n\nI am not a coder, I do not code, I have no interest in how an LLM performs with code. I am looking to use LLMs to assist in business development (branding, marketing research, deep research such as trend analysis and competitive analysis, copywriting, workflow, financial analysis, etc) and the occasional social media caption or blog post.\n\nIt seems like the three mentioned are the top choices but the reviews and suggestions I find are 1+ years old. Does anyone have any more recent experience with these, or can steer me in the right direction for the service that best fits my needs? Thank you.\n\nThank you for your submission, for any questions regarding AI, please check out our wiki at [https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki) (this is currently in test and we are actively adding to the wiki)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
