  "EnhancedContent": "AI isn’t waiting for our debates. It doesn’t care about empathy. It’s not asking *who* it displaces, it’s just replacing. Yes, the ethics matter. But the momentum is bigger than the conversation. So maybe the real question isn’t *“Should we allow this?”* but *“How do we adapt before it’s too late?”* What do you think - are we moving fast enough to keep up?\n\nThank you for your submission, for any questions regarding AI, please check out our wiki at [https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki) (this is currently in test and we are actively adding to the wiki)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/AI_Agents) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nThe right ethics can guide AI, but they can’t slow its momentum.\n\nWill all this really matter to the ones who are leading the AI race? Or is it just to shower some concern and care on humanity, that they say \"We're building AI that benefits all of humanity\"?",
