  "EnhancedContent": "Hey everyone, I'm looking for a free AI image generator that can create realistic photos. I've seen some amazing stuff out there, but a lot of the best tools seem to be paid. Does anyone know of any free options that produce high-quality, realistic images? Any recommendations or tips on what models or websites to use would be super helpful. Thanks!\n\nThank you for your submission, for any questions regarding AI, please check out our wiki at [https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ai_agents/wiki) (this is currently in test and we are actively adding to the wiki)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](/message/compose/?to=/r/AI_Agents) *if you have any questions or concerns.*\n\nIf you want realistic AI image generators for free, I’ve found that platforms like Stable Diffusion offer great quality without upfront cost, though you might need some tweaking to get the best results. Also check out Craiyon (formerly DALL·E mini) for quick rough drafts. Pro tip: always experiment with prompt engineering to push quality. I’ve seen that learning the tool’s quirks pays off more than chasing shiny paid tools.\n\nWould love to hear if others are doing similar multi-agent orchestration for voice!",
