  "EnhancedContent": "Hi all,\n\nMy goal is to launch a small ML initiative/lab that:\n\n- Focus on non-mainstream but high-impact ML research areas.\n- Work on project-driven open-source contributions and papers from day one\n- Build a network and reputation through real, tangible outputs rather than just theory or coursework\n\nI want this to be lean and agile, not a formal institution, but a focused group of people (starting small) who want to push boundaries and build a reputation in underexplored domains.\n\n**What I‚Äôm looking for:**\n\n- Suggestions on promising underexplored ML fields or projects with potential real-world impact\n- Advice on structuring such a lab efficiently (collaboration tools, workflow, open-source best practices)\n- Potential collaborators interested in contributing to projects with measurable outputs\n- Any pitfalls to watch out for in early-stage lab building\n\n**Conditions I‚Äôm considering:**\n\n1. Projects must be open-source and reproducible.\n2. Research and code contributions should aim for quality over quantity.\n3. Members commit to regular updates and active communication.\n4. We focus on non-mainstream areas to avoid crowded research spaces.\n5. All contributions must align with ethical standards.\n6. Aim for publishable or demonstrable outcomes, no just ‚Äúexploratory‚Äù hacks.\n7. Small core team at first (3-5 people max) to stay agile.\n8. Clear documentation and modular code required from day one.\n\nWould appreciate any concrete ideas or feedback. Also open to recommendations on platforms or tools that could help us run this smoothly.\n\nHere's a tool that may help your team do quick prototyping/ releasing: Hyperpod AI: Free Platform To Turn Your AI Models Into apps, fast. Just drag and drop your AI model into the platform and it will be turned into an API. Fast inference and cost-efficient (outperforms baseten, cerebrium and lightning AI)\n\nüåê Website: [https://hyperpodai.com](https://hyperpodai.com) üìÑ Docs: [https://docs.hyperpodai.com](https://docs.hyperpodai.com)",
