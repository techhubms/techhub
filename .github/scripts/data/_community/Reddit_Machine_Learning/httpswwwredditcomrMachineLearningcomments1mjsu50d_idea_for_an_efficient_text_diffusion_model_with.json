  "Title": "[D] Idea for an efficient text diffusion model with adaptive, token-level steps",
  "FeedLevelAuthor": "Machine Learning",
  "EnhancedContent": "Hi [r/MachineLearning](/r/MachineLearning/),\n\nI've been thinking about the inefficiency of using a fixed number of inference steps in text diffusion models. It seems wasteful to use the same amount of compute for a simple sentence as for a complex one.\n\nI've prototyped an alternative architecture I'm calling \"Adaptive Refinement Diffusion,\" and I'd love your feedback on it.\n\nThe core idea is:\n\n- Instead of a fixed loop, the model iteratively refines the sequence.\n- At each step, it calculates a confidence score for every token (based on a mix of its embedding stability and prediction probability).\n- If a token's score passes a certain threshold, it gets \"frozen\" and is excluded from future computation.\n- The entire generation process stops dynamically once all tokens in the sequence are frozen.\n\nThis means the model would naturally focus compute on the more difficult or ambiguous tokens and could finish simple sentences much faster.\n\nMy questions for the community are:\n\n1. Does this architecture already exist? I've searched for prior work but haven't found this specific token-level freezing mechanism.\n2. What potential flaws or failure modes do you see with this approach?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or links to related papers. Thanks!\n\nSomething like this? [https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09324](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09324)\n\nI don't think it's strictly \"diffusion\" but I would check follow up work on this paper since it's quite old now.\n\nAre you sure the confidence score will be available and useful/accurate at earlier steps?\n\nNo, obviously not, but as the iterations proceed, the score would get closer and closer to the threshold (which can be a learnable parameter itself) and once the threshold is crossed, only the tokens that have crossed the threshold(s) will be frozen.\n\nWhat would happen to shift operations? Think of a still noisy section of content that somehow needs more or less tokens as it gets more concrete.\n\nI haven't really thought about it. Do you have any ideas?\n\nThe idea seems related to dynamic or adaptive models. Look in these surveys to see if you find anything similar:\n\n[https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-Diffusion-Model-Survey](https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-Diffusion-Model-Survey)\n\nAdapting Neural Networks at Runtime: Current Trends in At-Runtime Optimizations for Deep Learning\n\n[https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Dynamic-Neural-Network-Structure%3A-A-Review-for-its-Guo-Chen/7226ea6fde104bd3bf94610090ca7193da4fdac4](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Dynamic-Neural-Network-Structure%3A-A-Review-for-its-Guo-Chen/7226ea6fde104bd3bf94610090ca7193da4fdac4)\n\nAlso this paper is not diffusion but it stops changing tokens after a threshold:\n\n[https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04200](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04200)",
