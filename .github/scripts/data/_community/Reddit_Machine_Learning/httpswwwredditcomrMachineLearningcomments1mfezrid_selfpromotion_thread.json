Trustworthy Machine Learning with a Focus on Generative AI at UCLA Extension\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm excited to share that I'll be teaching a new course at UCLA Extension:¬†**Trustworthy Machine Learning (COM SCI X 450.44)**. This is a 11 week (full quarter), 4 credit course. The credits are transferable to other universities. We will have weekly lectures and assignments. You will walk away with 2 full projects to show case your expertise.\n\nIn today's job market, there's a significant and growing demand for professionals who can build¬†**trustworthy machine learning systems**. Many roles now require expertise in areas like model reliability, safety, privacy, and fairness. There is a huge demand with adversarial testing, red teaming, prompt injection guardrails and many more. However, this critical skillset often isn't taught in a cohesive way outside of specialized graduate programs.\n\nThis course aims to bridge that gap by providing a deep dive into building reliable and responsible ML systems, with a special emphasis on applications in¬†**generative AI**. If you're looking to develop both the theoretical understanding and practical skills needed to ensure your ML models are secure, private, fair, and compliant, this course is for you!\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n\n- How to critically evaluate ML systems for trustworthiness.\n- Practical implementation experience in security, privacy, and fairness.\n- Designing and developing secure, fair, and privacy-preserving ML systems.\n- Evaluating and integrating diverse security models and APIs.\n- AI Model evaluation and safety alignment\n- LLM vulnerabilities, red teaming\n- Understanding and mitigating security issues specifically within Generative AI.\n\nWe'll be working with industry-standard tools and frameworks through extensive hands-on assignments and projects.\n\n**Prerequisites:**¬†To get the most out of this course, you should have basic machine learning knowledge and Python programming skills, especially with deep neural networks. Practical experience developing ML models in Python is essential, and a working knowledge of Large Language Models (like GPT) is recommended. If you're unsure about your readiness, there's a take-home assignment available to help you gauge your skillset.\n\nYou can find more details and register for the course here:[Trustworthy Machine Learning Course](https://www.uclaextension.edu/computer-science/machine-learning-ai/course/trustworthy-machine-learning-com-sci-x-45044)\n\nThe course website: [https://trustworthyml-ai.github.io/](https://trustworthyml-ai.github.io/)\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you might have in the comments!\n\n# TL;DR: Take a 5-minute survey to contribute to the State of AI Report 2025. Your insights on AI usage will be publicly shared and help define industry trends.\n\n**Survey link**: [https://airstreet.typeform.com/survey](https://airstreet.typeform.com/survey)\n\n**Why participate?**\n\n- Your data directly influences a report read by researchers at OpenAI, Tesla, policymakers, and 500k+ others\n- All aggregated data will be publicly available after publication\n- Help document real AI usage patterns vs. hype\n- Shape conversations in startups, big tech, academia, and policy\n\n**About the State of AI Report**: Since 2018, it's become the go-to free resource for understanding AI progress. Featured in The Economist, Financial Times, MIT Tech Review, and more. Peer-reviewed by experts from leading AI organisations.\n\n**What we're looking for:**\n\n- How you're actually using AI tools today\n- Your perspectives on AI development and impact\n- Industry-specific use cases and challenges\n\nTakes ~5 minutes. No marketing spam, just contributing to open research.\n\nReport website: [https://www.stateof.ai/](https://www.stateof.ai/)\n\nThanks for helping document the real state of AI!\n\nHi everyone! I‚Äôve been experimenting with combining language model agents and web scraping and ended up building ScrapeCraft. The idea is to let a language model build and run scrapers for you: you describe the task and the assistant writes Python code using ScrapeGraphAI and LangGraph. ScrapeCraft can handle multiple sites at once, create a schema on the fly, generate asynchronous Python code and stream the results as they arrive. The back end is built with FastAPI and LangGraph, the front end with React, and everything is packaged with Docker for easy deployment. This is a very early release with no paid tiers; it‚Äôs completely open source under the MIT license. I‚Äôd really appreciate feedback on the approach and suggestions for future improvements. You can find the project at [https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/scrapecraft](https://github.com/ScrapeGraphAI/scrapecraft) .",
