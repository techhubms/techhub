Reviewers seem to reject papers just for the sake of rejection. There’s a sense that some reviewers reject papers not on substantive grounds, but out of an implicit obligation to limit acceptance rates. Rebuttals appear to be pointless as reviewers take stubborn positions and not acknowledge their misunderstandings during this period. Good science just doesn’t appear to be as valued as the next flashiest LLM/VLM that gets pretty results.\n\nI do think this is a problem with the whole peer review system rather than zero sum. IMO, plenty of papers get accepted and submitted that don’t entirely reach the standards of A\\* conferences back in the day. The huge numbers of submissions means that there are too few reviewers available and those often are first or second year PhD students that obviously are quite knowledgeable in their areas but don’t yet have the broader knowledge of the field nor the time to accurately review papers outside their expertise. It’s a problem of wanting to publish only in A\\* conferences even when you know acceptance is a stretch for some of the work. The need to publish many papers leads to unfinished work that is split across two or three ok/good papers that combined would’ve made a pretty good one. In that way, having to publish or die and everyone attempting A\\* conferences fuels the cycle of increasing numbers of submissions. But overall I’d say excellent papers will most likely be accepted while good papers really depend on luck in the reviewer selection.\n\nConferences don’t play remotely the same role outside of ML and CS, so I wouldn’t use them comment on the whole of modern academic publishing. I come from the math and statistics (and cog sci way back in the day) side of things and this whole process of foreign to me - I’ve only ever gone to conferences for poster/talks that were published in a journal. In these spheres, I’d liken it to a caste system more than anything.\n\nFair point. Perhaps I should have been more specific, but I am referencing the current ML landscape\n\nThe only way to solve this problem is to change the culture of conferences being so important. Return conferences as a place for discussion, not publication, like how other domains are.\n\nNeurIPS 2025 had 25,000 submissions. CVPR 2025 had 13,000 submissions. These conferences accept 2,000-4,000 papers (i.e. presentations) and have 10,000 attendees. Unless you dramatically change the model of the conferences, like to a convention style conference, then you couldn't realistically handle much more. It's just going to get worse because the number of submissions keep increasing.\n\nConferences reviews are different than journal reviews. For conferences, reviewers are looking for a reason to reject the paper. For journals, reviewers try to improve the paper.\n\nMy Neurips Reviewers are stubborn to accept their flaws and we have provided almost 10 more empirical now they are still not able to accept their flaws we released ckpts, code damnn\n\nWhat exactly is zero sum? Scientific progress is not zero sum. The amount of papers accepted at a specific conference is obviously a more or less fixed number so that is zero sum. But if more scientific progress is made in the fields, more conferences and journals become available.\n\nlol no.\n\nThere is noise but the signal prevails, this has not fundamentally changed in my opinion.\n\n&gt; person’s rejection is another person’s acceptance / reviewers reject papers not on substantive grounds, but out of an implicit obligation to limit acceptance rates\n\nI don't think that's true at all, obviously rejecting one or two papers will not have any noticeable impact on the acceptance of your own submission. Likewise accepting or rejecting all 5 papers in your batch will not have any impact on the overall acceptance rate.\n\n&gt; Rebuttals appear to be pointless as reviewers take stubborn positions and not acknowledge their misunderstandings during this period\n\nRebuttals always have been and always will be pointless.\n\nThey only make sense if there is a substantial misunderstanding between the authors and the reviewer. That is rarely really the case.",
