I'm Nick, and in this video, I want to talk about the .NET Library ecosystem, focusing on open-source libraries specifically and talking about the different monetisation models that authors choose to adopt, as well as the idea that we can \"save\" open source projects by forking them.\n\nCheck out my workshops: https://dometrain.com/workshops/\n\nDon't forget to comment, like and subscribe :)\n\nSocial Media: Follow me on GitHub: https://github.com/Elfocrash Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/nickchapsas Connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-chapsas\n\n#csharp #dotnet"
