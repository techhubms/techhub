  "Description": "Tutch uses the Microsoft Cloud stack to build solutions for retailers and mall operators globally, embracing agentic AI and how it can be applied to the retail experience. Dynamic product recommendations, OpenAI and agentic AI, and the data platforms that Microsoft provides make evolutionary insights possible.\n\nIn just over three years of Tutch partnering with Beacon Lighting, Beacon has seen an increase in their basket size of over 30% and a 42% increase in the number of views. That's a really significant showcase of how technology is being applied, and Microsoft's range of technology has made it a lot easier for Tutch to do so.\n\nLearn more about Microsoft Cloud and Microsoft for Retail: https://msft.it/6058siQMG\n\n#Microsoft #MicrosoftCloud #AzureAI",
