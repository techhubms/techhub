  "Description": "Azure CycleCloud is an enterprise-friendly tool for orchestrating and managing High Performance Computing (HPC) environments on Azure. With CycleCloud, you can provision infrastructure for HPC systems, deploy familiar HPC schedulers, and automatically scale the infrastructure to run jobs efficiently at any scale. Azure CycleCloud Workspace for Slurm (CCWS) is a Microsoft product designed to allow researchers to quickly get up and running with \"traditional\" HPC job schedulers. Scaling to thousands of cores out of the box, it also provides access to ease-of-use tools like Open OnDemand, Grafana, and Cendio ThinLinc. In this webinar, we'll cover the basics of CycleCloud, how to get started with CCWS, and some of the additional integration with tools like Open OnDemand.\n\nJoin the Microsoft Azure for Academic Research community (https://msft.it/6050sLhro) on LinkedIn to follow this exciting series where we will post announcements about monthly webinars on cutting edge research focused topics!\n\n#Azure #CycleCloud #HPC #Microsoft #MicrosoftCloud",
