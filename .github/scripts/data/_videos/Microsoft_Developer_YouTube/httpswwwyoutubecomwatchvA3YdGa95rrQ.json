  "Description": "The future of software engineering isn't about replacing developers - it's about multiplying them 100x through AI agent orchestrationüöÄ\n\nSoftware engineers are evolving from individual coders to tech leads managing fleets of asynchronous AI agents. While agents handle the coding, humans focus on the critical bottlenecks: understanding user needs, engineering and orchestrating the context and workflows, implementing evaluations, and verifying outputs - because you're still underwriting the risk of what gets deployed.\n\n‚ö° Live Demo Highlights:\n- Research Agent creating rich PRDs from M365 Copilot work context\n- GitHub Spark rapid prototyping for better context\n- aifoundry.app and asyncloom.com highlighting how multiple coding agents can be employed and orchestrated\n- Teams app for monitoring agents while you're on a walk\n- GitHub Actions workflows with automated testing agents\n\nüîó Essential Resources\n\nAsync Loom Platform: https://asyncloom.com AI Foundry Platform: https://aifoundry.app GitHub Agent Setup: https://github.com/agent-unlock Azure AI Foundry: https://ai.azure.com Codex Coding Agent Deep Dive: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/securely-turbo%E2%80%91charge-your-software-delivery-with-the-codex-coding-agent-on-azure-openai/\n\nAll episodes: https://aka.ms/SipAndSyncPlaylist\n\nChapters: 00:00 Why software engineering is evolving, not disappearing 00:35 The new paradigm: Humans as orchestrators, agents as executors 02:30 Demo: AI tour keynote creation with agent coordination 05:30 Async Loom: Command center for your agent army 08:30 GitHub integration and background agent workflows 10:30 The bottom line: 100x productivity through smart orchestration Join Priyanka Vergadia and Govind Kamtamneni on Sip and Sync with Azure as they demonstrate this paradigm shift in action!
