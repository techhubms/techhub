  "Description": "In this hands-on session, you’ll learn how to build intelligent, domain-specific AI agents using Microsoft Foundry Agent Service. We’ll go step by step—from creating a basic agent to extending it with custom tools, external data, and live integrations. By the end of the workshop, you’ll have built your own Contoso PizzaBot, an AI assistant capable of:\n\n- Following tailored system prompts\n- Using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer questions from custom documents\n- Calling custom tools like a pizza calculator\n- Integrating with an MCP server for live menu and order management\n\nhttps://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay1\n\nJoin the conversation on the Microsoft Foundry Discord: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Discord Sign up for an Azure Free Trial: https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT Get hands-on with today's MCP lab repo: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay1 Catch up on-demand: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/OnDemand",
