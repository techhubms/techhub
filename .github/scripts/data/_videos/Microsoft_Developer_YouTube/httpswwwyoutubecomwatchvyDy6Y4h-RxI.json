  "Description": "In this episode, we continue our journey into the Semantic Kernel AI Agents Toolbox, focusing on how to build intelligent agents using MCP Servers and Python. Join us as Evan Mattson walks through three hands-on demos that showcase:\n\nHow MCP tools are invoked when constructing AI agents with Semantic Kernel. Using the GitHub MCP Server Using the Microsoft Learn MCP Server. A practical look at how Azure AI Foundry fits into the picture. Whether you're just getting started or looking to deepen your understanding of Semantic Kernel and MCP, this episode offers practical insights and real-world examples to help you build more capable AI agents.\n\nPlease watch the part 1 \"Building AI Agent Workflows with Semantic Kernel\" here https://youtu.be/3JFKwerYj04\n\n‚úÖ Chapters: 00:00 Introduction 01:14 Whats MCP - Model Context Protocol 02:33 API Economy vs MCP Servers 05:27 How the AI Agent communicates with MCP Servers 07:53 Demo - How Function calling works!
