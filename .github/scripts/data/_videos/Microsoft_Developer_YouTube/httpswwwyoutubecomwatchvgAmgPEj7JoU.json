  "Description": "Medical professionals often spend too much time on manual documentation, limiting patient interaction. The AI-powered Medical Voice Agent lets clinicians dictate notes while AI extracts key details like symptoms, medications, and next steps. This structured data is instantly added to a Model-Driven App, improving accuracy and reducing errors. A built-in text-based Copilot summarizes past visits and prompts follow-ups, such as reminders about previously mentioned medications.\n\nTogether, these AI agents streamline workflows and support safer, more efficient patient care.\n\n✅ Chapters: 00:00 Introduction 01:59 Problem statement and business value impact 04:52 Solution design 08:57 Demo of AI Voice agent 05:20 Demo of conversational agent 15:39 Solution components explained 21:57 Questions and answers 24:18 Outro\n\n✅ Resources: LinkedIn profile - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeevarajankumar Blog - https://crmindian.com",
