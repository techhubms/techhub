  "Description": "In this session, discover how SQL Serverâ€¯2025â€™s new native REST functionality, combined with Pure Storage FlashArrayâ€™s advanced snapshot tagging, empowers DBAs to create a self-documenting, metadata-rich snapshot backup catalog without the need for external tools or catalogs. Gone are the days when DBAs had to think in terms of storage volumes and admins had to juggle snapshots. With Protection Group Tags embedded directly into snapshots, you can now work with each snapshot with context: database name, instance details, backup timestamp, and more and query them seamlessly via Tâ€‘SQL. Whether you're managing local arrays or replicating snapshots across data centers or cloud, this catalog travels with the snapshot, keeping your metadata intact and accessible across your entire storage environment.\n\nAttendees will walk away with actionable knowledge on: Integrating SQL Serverâ€¯2025 with FlashArray using the new sp\\_invoke\\_external\\_rest\\_endpoint stored procedure to automate snapshot creation and tagging directly from Tâ€‘SQL. Embedding rich metadata into snapshot objects, including attributes like database name, SQL instance, timestamp, backup type, and backup URL. Building a truly queryable backup catalog: Use snapshots as first-class data assets that you can search by database, instance, time range, or any tag combinations. Ensuring portability and consistency by tagging snapshots as copyable, so metadata remains intact even when snapshots are replicated across arrays or data centers.\n\nJoin us and transform the way you manage backups making them smarter, more discoverable, and entirely self-describing.\n\nâœ… Chapters: 0:00 Introduction 3:25 Partnership 5:28 Real-world example 7:00 Demo 9:10 Getting started\n\nðŸ“Œ Let's connect: Twitter - Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna Twitter - AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\nðŸ”´ Watch even more Data Exposed episodes: https://aka.ms/dataexposedyt\n\nðŸ”” Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips: Microsoft Azure SQL: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt Microsoft SQL Server: https://aka.ms/mssqlserveryt Microsoft Developer: https://aka.ms/microsoftdeveloperyt\n\n#AzureSQL #SQL #LearnSQL",
