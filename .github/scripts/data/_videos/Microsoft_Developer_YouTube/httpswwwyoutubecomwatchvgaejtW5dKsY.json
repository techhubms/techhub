  "Title": "Tackling tech debt with the GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent",
  "Description": "Before the age of agents, tech debt often went straight from the backlog to the graveyard. While it’s important to continually identify ways to improve your services, it can be difficult to prioritize those items over customer-facing enhancements.\n\nWith the introduction of AI agents, that paradigm has shifted: you can now more easily modernize, refactor, and evolve your codebase, ensuring it never becomes the next legacy. This talk will cover how to embrace the process of modernizing legacy software and how to leverage AI agents, like Copilot coding agent, to keep your codebase up to date.\n\nJoin the conversation on the Microsoft Foundry Discord: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Discord Sign up for an Azure Free Trial: https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT Get hands-on with today's VS Code lab repo: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay2 Catch up on-demand: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/OnDemand Continue learning next week with AI Apps & Agents' global sessions: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Next Register for the January AI Dev Days Hackathon: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Hackathon",
