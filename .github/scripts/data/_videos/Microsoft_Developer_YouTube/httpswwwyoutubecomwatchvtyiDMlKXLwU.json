  "Description": "In this episode, weâ€™ll show how Fabric Real-Time Intelligence brings streaming into the SQL world. Youâ€™ll learn how to use familiar SQL constructs to ingest, transform, and analyze live event data, apply windowing for time-based analytics, and build event-driven applications. Weâ€™ll walk through an end-to-end demo featuring rich connectors in RTI, processing real-time data with SQL operator, setting up alerts for instant action, and Copilot-generated dashboards. To wrap up, weâ€™ll explore how to leverage Copilot with Eventhouse KQL queries and Data Agent capabilities.\n\nâœ… Chapters: 0:00 Introduction 3:10 Fabric Eventstreams 5:42 Build Real-Time Applications Using SQL 8:00 Demo 11:30 Connect events from many types of sources 13:30 Real-Time AI: CoPilot, Data & Operational Agents\n\nâœ… Resources: Fabric Eventstream :https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities\n\nRTI end-to-end sample: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/sample-end-to-end\n\nFabric Eventstream end-to-end demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFxlYkfoQZE&t=3s ðŸ“Œ Let's connect: Twitter - Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna Twitter - AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\nðŸ”´ Watch even more Data Exposed episodes: https://aka.ms/dataexposedyt\n\nðŸ”” Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips: Microsoft Azure SQL: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt Microsoft SQL Server: https://aka.ms/mssqlserveryt Microsoft Developer: https://aka.ms/microsoftdeveloperyt\n\n#AzureSQL #SQL #LearnSQL"
