  "Description": "The MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code continues to evolve, bringing new capabilities that help developers build AI-ready applications faster. In this episode, we explore what is new in the latest release, including the in-product changelog experience, Edit Data enhancements, and GitHub Copilot reaching general availability.\n\nWe take a closer look at GitHub Copilot in both Ask and Agent modes, showing how improved context awareness helps developers work more intuitively with their databases, even when starting without an active connection. From understanding schemas to guiding next steps, Copilot helps reduce friction and accelerate everyday SQL workflows.\n\nTo wrap up, we demonstrate how to evolve a traditional SQL schema into an AI-ready one using vector data types in SQL Server 2025. By combining GitHub Copilot, Python, and semantic search, we show how modern SQL and VS Code come together to power intelligent applications.\n\nLearn how GitHub Copilot at GA helps you build smarter SQL applications in Visual Studio Code in this episode of Data Exposed.\n\n✅ Chapters: 0:00 Introduction 1:00 GitHub Copilot Release Review 2:50 Demo\n\n✅ Resources: Install: https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql Demos: https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-demos Blogs: https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-blogs Documentation: https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-docs\n\n📌 Let's connect: Twitter - Anna Hoffman, https://twitter.com/analyticanna LinkedIn - Carlos Robles, https://twitter.com/croblesm Twitter - Carlos Robles, https://www.linkedin.com/in/croblesm Twitter - AzureSQL, https://aka.ms/azuresqltw\n\n🔴 Watch even more Data Exposed episodes: https://aka.ms/dataexposedyt\n\n🔔 Subscribe to our channels for even more SQL tips: Microsoft Azure SQL: https://aka.ms/msazuresqlyt Microsoft SQL Server: https://aka.ms/mssqlserveryt Microsoft Developer: https://aka.ms/microsoftdeveloperyt\n\n#AzureSQL #SQL #LearnSQL",
