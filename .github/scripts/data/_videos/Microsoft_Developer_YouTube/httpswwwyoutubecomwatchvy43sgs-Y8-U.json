  "Description": "Freeform tool calling in GPT-5 enables the model to send raw text payloads like Python scripts, SQL queries, or configuration files directly to external tools without needing to wrap them in structured JSONâ€”eliminating rigid JSON schemas and reducing integration overhead. In this episode, April shows you how the model executes model-generated SQL to compute results, routes the output to Python for formatting and visualization, and returns reproducible artifacts (CSVs, charts) all using natural language input.\n\nTry it yourself in Azure AI Foundry and start using freeform tool calling: ai.azure.com\n\nGet the code from this episode: https://aka.ms/insideAIF/code\n\nLearn more about Freeform Tool Calling with GPT-5: https://aka.ms/insideAIF/freeform-tool-calling\n\nJoin the Discord: https://aka.ms/insideAIF/discord Hop on Forum: https://aka.ms/insideAIF/forum\n\nChapters: 0:00 - 1:47 Welcome and introduction 1:48 - 7:48 Code review 7:49 - 12:45 Run the script & review output 12:46 - 13:14 Summary and more",
