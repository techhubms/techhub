Go from single-agent prototypes to fleet-level orchestration using the Microsoft Foundry Agent Framework (Semantic Kernel + AutoGen), shared state, Human in the loop, OpenTel, MCP toolchains, A2A, and the Activity Protocol. Bring frameworks like LangGraph and OpenAI Agents SDK, then deploy as containerized, governed, observable agents on Microsoft Foundry.\n\nJoin the conversation on the Microsoft Foundry Discord: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Discord Sign up for an Azure Free Trial: https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT Get hands-on with today's MCP lab repo: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay1 Catch up on-demand: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/OnDemand"
