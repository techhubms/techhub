  "Description": "Welcome to another episode of Sip and Sync! ☕🎤 In this episode, we dive into the critical topic of automation and security for AI deployments with special guest David Wright from HashiCorp. Broadcasting from Sydney, David shares how HashiCorp’s suite of tools like Vault, Packer, and the newly GA’d Vault Radar are helping organizations overcome the last-mile challenges in AI production. We explore why so many AI projects stall before reaching production, and how HashiCorp and Microsoft Azure are collaborating to solve this through verified modules, dynamic credentials, and context-aware security models. David also walks us through a live demo of a multi-agent AI app built with Terraform, showcasing how Vault enables secure, traceable, and scalable access for AI agents.\n\n⏱ Chapters: 00:05 – Welcome to Sip and Sync: Automation & Security for AI 00:11 – Dialing in David from Australia 00:33 – What is HashiCorp?
