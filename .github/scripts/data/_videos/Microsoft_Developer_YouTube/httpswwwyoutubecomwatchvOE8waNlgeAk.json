  "Title": "GHU: Building AI Agents with VS Code and GitHub",
  "Description": "In this interactive session, you’ll build and deploy an AI agent using the latest AI Toolkit and GitHub Copilot features inside VS Code. You'll start with a prototype setup, where Copilot connects to the AI Toolkit through an MCP server to suggest models, open the model playground, instrument code for tracing, enable viewing traces, and finally deploy the agent to Azure. You’ll leave with a functioning, traced, and deployed agent — plus a repeatable local-to-cloud workflow.\n\nJoin the conversation on the Microsoft Foundry Discord: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Discord Sign up for an Azure Free Trial: https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT Get hands-on with today's MCP lab repo: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay1 Catch up on-demand: https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/OnDemand"
