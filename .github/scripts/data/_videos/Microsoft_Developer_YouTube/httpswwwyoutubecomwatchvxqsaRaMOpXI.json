  "Description": "Imagine a world where AI agents can easily connect to any data source, tool, or API without having to rely on one-off custom integrations. That world exists, and it’s based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) – an open standard that's fundamentally changing how Large Language Models interact with external systems.\n\nIn this technical deep dive, we'll explore the architecture behind MCP, from its transport layer to its primitive abstraction patterns. You will learn how MCP servers expose capabilities through a standard interface, enabling AI models to dynamically discover and interact with everything from databases to development environments. We’ll have both practical demos as well as see how major AI platforms are adopting MCP to break down integration silos.\n\nYou'll leave the session with a comprehensive understanding of MCP's security model, best practices for server development, and strategies for migrating existing integrations to this game-changing standard. Whether you're building AI applications, maintaining APIs, or architecting the next generation of developer tools, this session will equip you with the knowledge needed to start using MCP and help shape the future of AI interoperability.\n\nVisual Studio: http://visualstudio.com VS Live on-demand sessions: https://aka.ms/vslivehq25 Missed the fun at MS HQ?!
