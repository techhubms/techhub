Just like brewing the perfect cup of coffee doesn't have to be complicated, getting started with GenAI for Java doesn't need to be intimidating when you have the right tools! Building on the introduction, this hands-on episode shows you exactly how to set up your development environment quickly and easily. You'll learn how to use GitHub Codespaces to eliminate complicated setup processes, how to fork and work with the demo repository, and how to access GitHub Modelsâ€”Microsoft's online repository of AI models that you can test with for free.\n\nRory demonstrates step-by-step how to create a fine-grained token for accessing GitHub Models, set up your dev container with all the necessary Java tools and Visual Studio Code pre-configured, and run your first \"Hello World\" example using the OpenAI SDK with GPT-4o mini. The best part? You can do all of this using GitHub's free tier for Codespaces, making it accessible to everyone.\n\nThis tutorial is perfect for Java developers who want to start experimenting with large language models without the hassle of complex local installations. By the end of this session, you'll have a working development environment and understand the foundational tools you'll use throughout the rest of this series.\n\nNext up we'll dive deeper into core generative AI techniques, practical samples, and responsible AI practices.
