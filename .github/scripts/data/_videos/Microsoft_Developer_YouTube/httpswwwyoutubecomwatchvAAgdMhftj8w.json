  "Description": "AI agents are quickly moving from prototypes to production ‚Äî and openness is key to making them scalable, interoperable, and community-driven. In this session, we‚Äôll introduce our Agent Framework, a new open source project from Microsoft that converges Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into a single pro-code SDK for building multi-agent systems. We‚Äôll explore how it enables developers to orchestrate agents across clouds, tools, and models while contributing to open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Whether you‚Äôre an OSS enthusiast or an AI practitioner, you‚Äôll walk away with a clear understanding of how to start building, experimenting, and shaping the agentic AI ecosystem together.\n\n‚úÖ Chapters: 00:15 Introduction 00:55 Big Announcement - New Agent Framework 02:30 Agent Systems with Agent Framework 04:16 From Semantic Kernel to Agent Framework 08:39 From AutoGen to Agent Framework 12:28 Agent Framework - Memory and Conversation State 16:00 Agent Framework - Enterprise-ready Foundations 18:54 Agent Framework - Demo 24:10 Agent Framework - Team Conversation 25:34 How to Contribute and Getting Started 26:51 Migration Paths From Semantic Kernel / AutoGen to Agent Framework 28:42 Sneak Peak of Agent Framework Workflow\n\n‚úÖ Resources: Get Started with Agent Framework: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework Learn more about Agent Framework: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/Docs Announcement Blog: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/PuPr Watch Sessions on-demand: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/AIShow\n\nüìå Let's connect: Jorge Arteiro | https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgearteiro Evan Mattson | https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanrmattson Elijah Straight | https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahstraight Eric Zhu | https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekzhu Victor Dibia | https://www.linkedin.com/in/dibiavictor Subscribe to the Open at Microsoft: https://aka.ms/OpenAtMicrosoft\n\nOpen at Microsoft Playlist: https://aka.ms/OpenAtMicrosoftPlaylist\n\nüìùSubmit Your OSS Project for Open at Microsoft https://aka.ms/OpenAtMsCFP\n\nNew episode on Tuesdays!"
