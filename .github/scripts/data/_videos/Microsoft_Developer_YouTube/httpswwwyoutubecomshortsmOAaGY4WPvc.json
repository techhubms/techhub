  "Description": "AI agents are quickly moving from prototypes to production ‚Äî and openness is key to making them scalable, interoperable, and community-driven. In this session, we‚Äôll introduce our Agent Framework, a new open source project from Microsoft that converges Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into a single pro-code SDK for building multi-agent systems. We‚Äôll explore how it enables developers to orchestrate agents across clouds, tools, and models while contributing to open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Whether you‚Äôre an OSS enthusiast or an AI practitioner, you‚Äôll walk away with a clear understanding of how to start building, experimenting, and shaping the agentic AI ecosystem together.\n\n‚úÖ Resources: Get Started with Agent Framework: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework Learn more about Agent Framework: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/Docs Announcement Blog: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/PuPr Watch Sessions on-demand: https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/AIShow\n\nüìå Let's connect: Jorge Arteiro | https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgearteiro Evan Mattson | https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanrmattson Elijah Straight | https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahstraight Eric Zhu | https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekzhu Victor Dibia | https://www.linkedin.com/in/dibiavictor Subscribe to the Open at Microsoft: https://aka.ms/OpenAtMicrosoft\n\nOpen at Microsoft Playlist: https://aka.ms/OpenAtMicrosoftPlaylist\n\nüìùSubmit Your OSS Project for Open at Microsoft https://aka.ms/OpenAtMsCFP\n\nNew episode on Tuesdays!\n\n#shorts #shortsfeed #shortsvideo #shortsyoutube #shortsviral"
