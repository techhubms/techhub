  "Title": "Externalizing Secrets Securely in Kubernetes with Secrets Store CSI Driver",
  "Description": "Storing secrets in Kubernetes via native Secret objects has long been standard practice - but evolving security and compliance requirements demand more secure approaches. In this episode, we introduce the Secrets Store CSI Driver, a Kubernetes SIG Auth subproject that securely integrates your workloads with external secret stores like Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager, and AWS Secrets Manager. The CSI Driver mounts secrets directly into your pods at runtime, enabling zero-touch rotation and significantly reducing the risk of secret exposure or compromise. Join Anish and Ben as they demonstrate how to use the Secrets Store CSI Driver to meet modern security and compliance needs while simplifying secret management in Kubernetes.\n\n‚úÖ Chapters: 00:00 Introduction 00:52 Why we need External Secrets on Kubernetes? 02:46 How Kubernetes Workloads consumes External Secrets 04:34 What's Secret Store CSI Driver 08:43 Developer Scenario 09:47 How it works? 12:04 Demo - Using Secret Store CSI Driver 21:40 Demo - Secret Rotation 25:45 What's Next and How to Contribute to the project\n\n‚úÖ Resources: Find the latest info about the open-source Secret Store CSI Driver project at: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver and https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/\n\nüìå Let's connect: Jorge Arteiro | https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgearteiro Anish Ramasekar | https://www.linkedin.com/in/anishramasekar Ben Petersen | https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminapetersen\n\nSubscribe to the Open at Microsoft: https://aka.ms/OpenAtMicrosoft\n\nOpen at Microsoft Playlist: https://aka.ms/OpenAtMicrosoftPlaylist\n\nüìùSubmit Your OSS Project for Open at Microsoft https://aka.ms/OpenAtMsCFP\n\nNew episode on Tuesdays!",
