  "Description": "Cloud storage management can be complex, with multiple tiers and considerations for performance and cost. With 6+ Azure Managed Disk tiers, teams often default to higher-cost options and hesitate to switch due to downtime concerns and limited usage insights. This can lead to inefficiencies at scale.\n\nIn this session, we’ll cover: • Common challenges in optimizing cloud storage • How Lucidity streamlines Azure Managed Disk tiering • A quick look at our new solution for smarter storage management\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://get.lucidity.cloud/hubfs/Solution%20Briefs/Lucidity%20Solution%20Brief%20-%20Lumen.pdf?\\_gl=1\\*128pm38\\*\\_gcl\\_au\\*MTkwNTc3MTkzNi4xNzUzMjIyNTA1Ljk5MjYyNDE3Mi4xNzU4ODE2MzgxLjE3NTg4MTYzODE 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Vatsal Rastogi 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
