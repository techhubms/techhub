  "Description": "Windows ML is a new performance-first AI framework built into Windows to enable secure, on-device inferencing across CPU, GPU, and NPU. See how you can use various models with no cloud or extra infrastructure needed. Learn how Windows ML helps streamline deployment across diverse hardware tiers and manage dependencies to reduce your app size to deliver fast, private, and scalable AI experiences.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-WinAIFoundry 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Andrew Leader \\* Anastasiya Tarnouskaya 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
