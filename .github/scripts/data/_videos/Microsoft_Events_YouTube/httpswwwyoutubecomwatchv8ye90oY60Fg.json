  "Description": "Join Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich as they trace computing’s evolution from the Altair 8800 to today’s cloud. In this live, demo-driven session, you’ll see how the humble toggle switch gave rise to REST APIs, why terminals are making a comeback, and how the architectural patterns of 1975 illuminate 2025’s biggest trends. Along the way, we’ll connect the dots from early personal computing to hyperscale platforms, highlighting how modern apps are built, scaled, and delivered in the cloud.\n\n𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Mark Russinovich \\* Scott Hanselman 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
