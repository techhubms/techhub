  "Description": "What if your AI agents could remember, learn and collaborate at lightning speed? Discover how Azure Managed Redis, Mem0, and Agent Framework turn stateless agents into intelligent systems. Redis enables real-time collaboration, long-term learning, and semantic routing. Mem0 adds persistent memory across sessions, while Agent Framework powers reasoning and planning. Together, they build smarter, scalable multi-agent systems ready for any domain.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-MicrosoftFabricAIDataSolutionsPlan 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Simon Brown \\* Shruti Pathak \\* Georgios Theologou \\* Mark Weitzel 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
