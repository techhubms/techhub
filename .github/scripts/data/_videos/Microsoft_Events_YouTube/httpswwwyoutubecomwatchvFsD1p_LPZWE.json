  "Description": "AI agents run on non-human identities: service principals, managed identities, tokens. If you can’t see them, you can’t govern them. Oasis gives Microsoft-native guardrails: discover every agent across Entra, Azure, M365, and GitHub; right-size roles; eliminate long-lived secrets; and automate lifecycle with owners, purpose, TTL, rotation, and evidence. Same developer speed, far less standing privilege.\n\n𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Yonit Glozshtein 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
