  "Description": "DevEx 2.0 means giving developers guardrails that accelerate delivery instead of slowing it. This session shows how continuous security integrates with Azure and GitHub pipelines. You’ll see IDE coaching and SAST at commit. With Microsoft Copilot and Azure OpenAI using GPT-5, developers can cut through false positives and receive actionable fixes directly in the code. Builds include SBOM generation, container scans, and dependency checks. Staging environments add DAST and API testing.\n\n𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Colin Bell 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
