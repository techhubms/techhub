  "Description": "AI agents aren't just the future of nonprofit operations—they are already here. Many nonprofits are early adopters of agentic AI, building solutions to drive mission-critical outcomes across program management, fundraising, and operations. This session will explore real-time adoption lessons from nonprofit peer institutions. Attendees will gain insights into the successes and challenges faced by these pioneers, as well as practical strategies for integrating AI agents into their own work.\n\n𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Morteza Ghazai 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
