  "Description": "The future of security operations is autonomous, adaptive, and deeply integrated—and Microsoft is delivering the blueprint. In this session, you’ll learn how to turn that vision into reality using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender. We’ll walk through how to architect a modern SOC that not only detects and responds to threats in real time, but also anticipates and prevents them using predictive shielding, agentic AI, and graph-powered reasoning.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-PredictAndDefendMicrosoftDefender 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Gary Berletti \\* Matt Graham \\* Raviv Tamir 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
