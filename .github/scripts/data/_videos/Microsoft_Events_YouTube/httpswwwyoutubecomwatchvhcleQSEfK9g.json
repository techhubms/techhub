  "Description": "Azure sets new inference records with 865K and 1.1M tokens/sec on ND GB200/GB300 v6 VMs. These results stem from deep stack optimization—from GPU kernels like GEMM and attention to multi-node scaling. Using LLAMA benchmarks, we’ll show how model architecture and hardware codesign drive throughput and efficiency. Customers benefit from faster time-to-value, lower cost per token, and production-ready infrastructure. Attendees can connect with Azure engineers to discuss best practices.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-migrateWSVMAIReady 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Hugo Affaticati \\* Nitin Nagarkatte 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
