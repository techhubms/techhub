  "Description": "Building intelligent AI agents is no simple task. With Microsoft Foundry Agent Service, you can rapidly create and deploy robust agents with the security, scalability, and integrations of Azure. In this walkthrough, we’ll build an agent that combines live data, reasoning, and dynamic tool usage. Using Azure Functions for real APIs and W&B Weave for detailed tracking, you’ll learn setup, tool registration, data endpoints, and Python-based interaction.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://wandb.ai/byyoung3/Generative-AI/reports/Building-and-evaluating-AI-agents-with-Azure-AI-Agent-Service-and-W-B-Weave--VmlldzoxMjQzNTM5MA 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Katherin Madche 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
