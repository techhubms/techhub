  "Description": "See how Microsoft Foundry on Windows makes enabling local AI easy on Copilot+ PCs with Windows AI APIs — no cloud, hosting, or ML expertise needed. Use built-in models on Copilot+ PCs like Phi Silica to integrate built-in language and vision capabilities. Enable turnkey features like summarization, rewriting, and image understanding with minimal code. Customize AI models with own proprietary data using LoRA (low rank adapter) fine-tuning and app content search.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-WinAIFoundry 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Connor Al-Joundi \\* Ivan Razumenic 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
