  "Description": "The rise of AI agents marks a turning point in how organizations operate. These agents don’t just work individually to automate tasks —they collaborate, orchestrate processes, and adapt dynamically to business needs. Preparing for that agentic future means rethinking roles, processes, and the very architecture of your business. Enterprise-grade platforms will be critical to this functional transformation, providing the security, compliance, and scalability needed to deploy agents responsibly and at scale. Join us to discover what this shift means for your organization and how to start preparing today.\n\n𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Bryan Goode \\* Dan Lewis \\* Aghogho Biakolo \\* Kendra Springer 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
