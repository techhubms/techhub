  "Description": "AI is reshaping NetOps from scripted automation to intelligent, data driven workflows. We will show uses: incident triage, knowledge retrieval, traffic analysis, prediction, and contrast legacy monitoring with ML, NLP, and LLMs. See how RAG, text to SQL, and agent workflows enable real time insights across hybrid data. We will outline data pipelines and MLOps, address accuracy, reliability, cost, compliance, and weigh build vs buy. We will cover API integration and human in the loop guardrails.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://www.kentik.com/solutions/microsoft-azure/ \\* https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/saas/kentik-technologies-inc.kentik-network-observability-platform 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Phillip Gervasi 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
