  "Description": "Downtime is expensive, and every minute counts when incidents hit. Yet valuable engineering time is lost to troubleshooting, instead of driving design and innovation. NeuBird’s Agentic AI SRE delivers real-time RCA and remediation, while ensuring enterprise-grade security and governance. It correlates telemetry across Azure Monitor, observability tools, and multi-cloud, helping reduce MTTR up to 90%.
