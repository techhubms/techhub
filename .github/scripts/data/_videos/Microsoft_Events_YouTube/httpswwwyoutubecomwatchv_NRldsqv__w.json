  "Description": "Training efficiency starts with precision. This session explores Azure supercomputing validation—from GPU kernels to LLAMA pretraining and large-scale model training. The process detects bottlenecks early, reduces cost, and boosts performance. Customers gain predictable throughput, faster training, and confidence in Azure’s readiness for multi-billion parameter models. Attendees will gain practical insights and engage directly with the engineers driving these innovations.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-migrate 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Hugo Affaticati \\* Nitin Nagarkatte 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
