  "Description": "Run open-source AI models of your choice with flexibility—from local environments to cloud deployments using Azure Container Apps and serverless GPUs for fast, cost-efficient inferencing. You will also learn how AKS powers scalable, high-performance LLM operations with fine-tuned control, giving you confidence to deploy your models your way. You’ll leave with a clear path to run custom and OSS models with agility and cost clarity.\n\nTo learn more, please check out these resources: \\* https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-AIAppsCosmosDB 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿𝘀: \\* Mehrdad Abdolghafari \\* Cary Chai \\* Sachi Desai 𝗦𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: This is one of many sessions from the Microsoft Ignite 2025 event.
