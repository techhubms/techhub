  "Description": "The Playwright MCP server helps Copilot do more than just run tests. It can confirm and resolve bugs too. In this demo, we’ve shared a bug report with Copilot Agent Mode. Copilot used Playwright to reproduce the issue, confirm the bug, explore the project, find the root cause, apply the fix, and verify it worked.\n\nMCP servers expand what Copilot Agent Mode can do by giving it new skills as an AI peer programmer.\n\n#GitHubCopilot #CodingAgent #CopilotCodingAgent\n\n00:00 Debugging with Playwright MCP Server 00:42 Checking Frontend & Network 01:18 Fixing the Bug\n\nStay up-to-date on all things GitHub by subscribing and following us at: YouTube: http://bit.ly/subgithub Blog: https://github.blog X: https://twitter.com/github LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/github Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/github TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@github Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GitHub/\n\nAbout GitHub: It’s where over 100 million developers create, share, and ship the best code possible.
