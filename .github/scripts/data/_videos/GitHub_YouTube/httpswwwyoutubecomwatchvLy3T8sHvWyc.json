  "Description": "This week on Open Source Friday, we’re talking with Open WebUI, a user-friendly self-hosted AI platform that makes it easier to interact with large language models. Open WebUI offers a sleek, self-hostable interface that lets developers and organizations deploy, manage, and experiment with AI models without the usual friction. Built and maintained by Tim Baek, this project accelerates access to LLMs and fosters faster innovation in the AI ecosystem. If you care about open-source AI tools and usability, Open WebUI is one to watch! Website: https://openwebui.com/ GitHub Repo: https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui",
