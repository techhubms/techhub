  "Description": "As agentic AI , like GitHub Copilot, transforms software development, enterprise administrators and platform engineering teams are becoming the architects of possibility—ensuring that when human developers and their agent teammates accelerate innovation, they're building on a foundation of security, governance, and control with tools like GitHub Advanced Security. In this session, GitHub's Chief Product Officer Mario Rodriguez celebrates GitHub admins, the unsung heroes who balance developer choice and velocity with enterprise requirements. Through practical demos, see how GitHub's latest enterprise capabilities, including GitHub Copilot Enterprise, deliver governance at scale at the pace of AI-powered development.
