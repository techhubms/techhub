  "Description": "From GitHub Universe 2025: Meet Ladybird Browser, the new independent web browser built entirely from scratch—no Chrome, WebKit, or Firefox.\n\nJelle Raaijmakers, COO of Ladybird Browser Initiative, joins us to discuss how their small team of 7-8 engineers is building a brand new web engine and JavaScript engine from zero. Learn about their nonprofit model, their approach to web standards compliance (currently 4th in Web Platform Tests), and how they're making browser development accessible to first-time contributors.\n\nKey topics covered: • Why build from scratch instead of forking Chromium • Technical architecture and security sandboxing • How a tiny team competes with thousand-person browser teams • The nonprofit funding model with no strings attached • Alpha release roadmap for 2026\n\n\"It feels like Firefox in the nineties\" - bringing choice back to the browser ecosystem.\n\nProject Links: 🌐 Website: https://ladybird.org 💻 GitHub: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird 🐦 Twitter: https://twitter.com/ladybirdbrowser 💬 Discord: https://discord.com/invite/nvfjVJ4Svh\n\nSupport the Project: Sponsor: https://donorbox.org/ladybird",
