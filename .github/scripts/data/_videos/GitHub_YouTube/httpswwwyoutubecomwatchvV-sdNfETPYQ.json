  "Title": "GitHub Next | Exploring Continuous AI",
  "Description": "AI agents are transforming software development. Today, you can assign tasks to agents in GitHub.com, in VS Code, and on the command line via Copilot CLI. But what if you didn’t have to assign tasks to your agents? What if they could do work on your behalf, continuously in the background, without you having to ask?\n\nIn GitHub Next, we’ve been exploring this idea, which we call “Continuous AI.” Just like continuous integration, Continuous AI is integrated into your development workflows and runs on GitHub Actions. But Continuous AI integrates LLMs and agents to do things that traditional continuous integration cannot – things that require judgement, that cannot be expressed as simple rules. They accelerate your team, not just individual developers.\n\nIn this talk, we will present the concept of Continuous AI, describe what kinds of tasks it is useful for, and show many examples of real Continuous AI workflows we are using in our own projects and with our collaborators in the open source community. We’ll show you how you can write your own Continuous AI workflows using our open-source tool, Agentic Workflows, as well as try out examples from the community.\n\nThis is a first look at experimental work from GitHub Next, GitHub's research and engineering team that focuses on shaping the future of software creation. If you’re curious about what’s coming next — and how to prepare for it — this session is for you.\n\nSpeakers: Eddie Aftandilian, Principal Researcher, GitHub (Speaker) Idan Gazit, Head of GitHub Next, GitHub (Speaker) Russell Horton, Staff Researcher, GitHub (Speaker) Terkel Gjervig, Staff Research Engineer, GitHub (Speaker)\n\n— CHAPTERS —\n\n00:00 Welcome to GitHub Next 03:16 Introducing Continuous AI: The agentic evolution of CI 04:54 Demo: Building agentic workflows with Pelli 12:32 Continuous AI in action: Localization and accessibility 15:14 Continuous AI in action: Agentic playtesting and test coverage 19:25 Continuous AI in action: Performance optimization and issue triage 23:11 How to make Continuous AI safe 26:31 How to get started with agentic workflows\n\n#AI #GitHubUniverse #GitHub\n\nWatch more videos from GitHub Universe 2025: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSwj2Ma0pnk&list=PL0lo9MOBetEFKNlPHNouEmVeYeyoyGTXC\n\nStay up-to-date on all things GitHub by connecting with us:\n\nYouTube: https://gh.io/subgithub Blog: https://github.blog X: https://twitter.com/github LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/github Insider newsletter: https://resources.github.com/newsletter/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/github TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@github\n\nAbout GitHub It’s where over 100 million developers create, share, and ship the best code possible.
