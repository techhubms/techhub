  "Description": "What happens when you migrate 150,000 repositories from a tangled web of legacy CI/CD tools to GitHub? CVS Health found out — and lived to tell the tale. They reshaped their entire developer experience by consolidating disparate tools into GitHub and GitHub Actions, freeing their platform teams to build instead of maintaining outdated systems. The result? Thousands of developers now share a modern workflow that makes collaboration faster, easier, and more consistent across one of healthcare's largest tech organizations. You'll walk away with real lessons from their journey, including what worked, what didn't, and practical strategies you can apply to your own large-scale migrations.\n\nSpeakers: Irene Modeste, Sr Product Manager - Developer Experience, CVS Health (Speaker) Jim Beyers, VP, Developer Experience, CVS Health (Speaker) Mitch Enderle, Executive Director, Platform Engineering, CVS Health (Speaker)\n\n#GitHubActions #GitHubUniverse #GitHub\n\n— CHAPTERS —\n\n00:00 Introduction and CVS Health's mission 03:42 The vibrancy technology strategy 05:50 Improving developer experience and tool standardization 10:58 Moving to a unified platform with GitHub EMU 14:19 Planning the repository migration at scale 16:24 Solutions for migration challenges 18:47 Migration roadmap and results 20:10 Future steps: CI/CD pipeline migration\n\nWatch more videos from GitHub Universe 2025: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSwj2Ma0pnk&list=PL0lo9MOBetEFKNlPHNouEmVeYeyoyGTXC\n\nStay up-to-date on all things GitHub by subscribing and following us at: YouTube: http://bit.ly/subgithub Blog: https://github.blog X: https://twitter.com/github LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/github Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/github TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@github Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GitHub/\n\nAbout GitHub: It’s where over 100 million developers create, share, and ship the best code possible.
