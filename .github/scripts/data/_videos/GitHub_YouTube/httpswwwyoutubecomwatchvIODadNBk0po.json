  "Description": "In this episode of the GitHub Podcast, Abby and Kedasha are joined by Keeley Hammond, a longtime maintainer of the Electron project. They explore the inner workings of one of the most widely used open source desktop frameworks, dive into how Electron empowers developers to build cross-platform desktop apps with web technologies, and discuss what it takes to build a welcoming and sustainable open source community at scale. The conversation touches on contributor culture, project governance, automation tools, and the role of AI in open source, in both its promise and its challenges.\n\nLinks mentioned in the episode:\n\nhttps://github.com/electron/electron https://github.com/electron/forge https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/ https://openjsf.org/ https://github.com/vert-d https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/ https://github.com/electron/governance https://github.com/electron/electron/issues https://github.com/unjs/issue-triage\n\nThe GitHub Podcast is hosted by Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, Kedasha Kerr and Cassidy Williams.
