  "Description": "The power of GitHub’s Agent HQ comes from mission control, a unified command center that follows you wherever you work. It’s not a single destination; it’s a consistent interface across GitHub, Visual Studio Code, GitHub Mobile, and the CLI that lets you direct, monitor, and manage every AI-driven task.\n\nWith mission control, you can choose from a fleet of agents, assign them work in parallel, and track their progress from any device.\n\n#GitHubCopilot #AgentHQ #GitHub\n\nStay up-to-date on all things GitHub by subscribing and following us at: YouTube: http://bit.ly/subgithub Blog: https://github.blog X: https://twitter.com/github LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/github Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/github TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@github Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/GitHub/\n\nAbout GitHub: It’s where over 100 million developers create, share, and ship the best code possible. It’s a place for anyone, from anywhere, to build anything—it’s where the world builds software. https://github.com",
