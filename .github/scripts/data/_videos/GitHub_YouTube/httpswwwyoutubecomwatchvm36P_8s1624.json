A self-taught developer who got tired of the \"extremely inefficient and circuitous way\" he learned programming, Quincy created freeCodeCamp in 2014 to give others a better path. Today, it serves millions of learners worldwide through interactive courses, thousands of YouTube videos, and a supportive global community.\n\n#freeCodeCamp #LearnToCode #DeveloperEducation #OpenSource #TechCareers #GitHubUniverse",
