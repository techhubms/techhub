  "Description": "Join GitHub's Andrea Griffiths and Jeff Keyes, Field CTO at Allstacks, to explore how the Intelligence Engine and AI-powered deep research agents help senior leaders optimize engineering investments and improve project predictability. We break down why most AI adoption falls short (hint: it's not just about code generation), address real challenges like watermelon projects, and discuss how to measure what actually matters: alignment and ROI. Learn how to speak the language of business, move beyond vanity metrics and dashboards, and use data-driven insights to eliminate bottlenecks across your entire development pipeline.",
