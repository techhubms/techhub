  "Title": "Tackling your tech debt with Copilot coding agent",
  "Description": "Before the age of agents, tech debt often went straight from the backlog to the graveyard. While it’s important to continually identify ways to improve your services, it can be difficult to prioritize those items over customer-facing enhancements.\n\nWith the introduction of AI agents, that paradigm has shifted: you can now more easily modernize, refactor, and evolve your codebase, ensuring it never becomes the next legacy. This talk will cover how to embrace the process of modernizing legacy software and how to leverage AI agents, like Copilot coding agent, to keep your codebase up to date.\n\nSpeaker: Brittany Ellich, Senior Software Engineer, GitHub (Speaker)\n\n— CHAPTERS — 00:00 Introduction: Tackling tech debt 01:20 The problem with tech debt management 03:12 Your new accelerator: The Copilot coding agent 03:54 Demo: Assigning a tech debt issue to Copilot 05:33 The WRAP strategy for eliminating tech debt 10:47 A developer's daily workflow with Copilot 12:05 Assign your backlog to Copilot\n\n#GitHubCopilot #GitHubUniverse #GitHub\n\nWatch more videos from GitHub Universe 2025: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSwj2Ma0pnk&list=PL0lo9MOBetEFKNlPHNouEmVeYeyoyGTXC\n\nStay up-to-date on all things GitHub by connecting with us:\n\nYouTube: https://gh.io/subgithub Blog: https://github.blog X: https://twitter.com/github LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com/company/github Insider newsletter: https://resources.github.com/newsletter/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/github TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@github\n\nAbout GitHub It’s where over 100 million developers create, share, and ship the best code possible.
