  "Description": "Join us on The Developer‚Äôs Journey, where we dive deep into the candid stories of software engineers navigating the highs and lows of their careers. From overcoming challenges to celebrating wins, this series offers an honest glimpse into the realities of life in tech.\n\nScott Hanselman is VP of Developer Community at Microsoft and he has a brand but he didn't spend his time building it. He spent his time doing the work, teaching and and lifting others up along the way. Scott shares his thoughts on the work AI should be doing - the dull, dangerous and dirty stuff. And the work it should not be doing - the fun and creative stuff. He reminds us that in a world of remote and hybrid work, human connection is important and has to be prioritized and that nothing beats a good old fashioned, in-person whiteboarding session with your coworkers.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or just starting out, this story will inspire and resonate with you.\n\nüîé Chapters: 00:00 Intro 00:46 Welcome Scott Hanselman 01:07 Scott's journey 01:41 How important is building a brand for developers (short answer: no) 07:38 Stop comparing.
