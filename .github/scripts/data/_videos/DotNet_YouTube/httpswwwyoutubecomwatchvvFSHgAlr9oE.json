  "Description": "This session showcases my journey of building an AI-powered sales dashboard using .NET MAUI and Azure OpenAI’s GPT-5 models, delivering a cross-platform business analytics app for Windows, Android, iOS, and macOS. Leveraging Syncfusion’s .NET MAUI controls, the dashboard visualizes revenue trends, product sales, regional performance, and key metrics like profit and growth through interactive charts, gauges, and maps. GPT-5 powers daily sales predictions with confidence intervals and anomaly flags, while its NLP capabilities enable a smart assistant for natural language queries. I’ll share my war story of overcoming challenges like ensuring cross-platform UI performance, and implementing MVVM architecture for reactive data binding in .NET 9. The live demo will highlight real-time visualizations, AI-driven forecasts, and conversational insights via the AI assistant, showcasing best practices for scalable, intelligent .NET MAUI apps. Attendees will learn how to architect AI-driven dashboards, integrate GPT-5 for predictive analytics, and create responsive UIs, making this ideal for developers building business solutions.\n\nSession: Architecting an AI-Powered Sales Dashboard with .NET MAUI and Azure OpenAI\n\nWatch more .NET Conf 2025 videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oXtIlvq1tuORUtZqVG-HdCt",
