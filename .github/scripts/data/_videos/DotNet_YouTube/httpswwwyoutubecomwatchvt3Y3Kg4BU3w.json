  "Description": "AI agents promise unprecedented autonomy and intelligence, but when they interact with enterprise data, security becomes the ultimate concern. In this session, we’ll explore how to securely enable AI agents to access and work with data in Azure SQL Database and SQL Server—regardless of whether you build them using frameworks, tools, or custom code. Enterprises demand airtight security, and the autonomous nature of agents introduces unique risks: unpredictable actions, potential data leaks, and compliance challenges. We’ll discuss proven strategies to enforce robust security boundaries, implement least-privilege access, and prevent unauthorized data exposure. Additionally, we’ll tackle another critical challenge: complex database schemas often lead to frequent agent errors. Learn practical techniques to improve schema understanding, reduce query mistakes, and ensure reliable, secure interactions between AI agents and your data. If you’re building AI-powered solutions for the enterprise, this session is your blueprint for doing it right—securely and effectively.\n\n✅ Resources: Learn more: https://aka.ms/agentic-modernization Get started: https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT\n\nConnect with .NET: Blog: https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog Twitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter TikTok: https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok Mastodon: https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon LinkedIn: https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin Facebook: https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet Forums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums 🙋‍♀️Q&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa 👨‍🎓Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet",
