  "Description": "Join us for a behind-the-scenes look at key .NET security cases investigated by the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) over the past year. We’ll unpack the root causes—from subtle coding pitfalls to systemic design oversights - and highlight recurring patterns that developers can proactively detect in their own applications. Whether you're building APIs, libraries, or cloud-native services, this session will sharpen your security intuition and equip you with actionable strategies to spot trouble before it ships.\n\n.NET 10 — The most intelligent and unified .NET yet: https://aka.ms/dotnet10/ .NET Aspire 13 — Simplified orchestration for cloud-native apps: https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement ASP.NET Core 10 — Modern, secure, and full-stack web development: https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025 .NET MAUI 10 — Build beautiful apps on every platform: https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025 C# 14 — A more expressive and productive language: https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025 F# 10 — Safer, faster, and more functional than ever: https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement Visual Studio 2026 — Faster, smarter, and built for the future: https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement .NET Conf 2025 — A global celebration of .NET innovation: https://aka.ms/dotnotconf2025/recap\n\nConnect with .NET: Blog: https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog Twitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter TikTok: https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok Mastodon: https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon LinkedIn: https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin Facebook: https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet Forums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums 🙋‍♀️Q&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa 👨‍🎓Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet",
