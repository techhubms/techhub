  "Title": "Old API, New Tricks: Add MCP to Existing .NET REST Endpoints",

  "Description": "Your existing .NET Web APIs have served you well—but what if they could do more with them in the era of AI? In this session, we’ll explore how to breathe new life into your existing ASP.NET Web API endpoints built with ASP.NET CORE by adding Model Creation Protocol (MCP) capabilities to them. We'll look at how the MCP C# SDK makes it simple to annotate your existing controllers, instantly transforming your REST endpoints into AI-powered services that can empower LLMs and agents. We’ll also compare this approach to a no-code approaches using Azure API Management. Finally we'll look at where both of these approaches fall short and are only a starting point for a good long-term MCP design. You can use then to jump start the process and then follow the path we outline together to evolve your APIs from technical plumbing to intelligent, task-focused tools that solve real problems using AI—all without starting from scratch. .NET 10 — The most intelligent and unified .NET yet: https://aka.ms/dotnet10/ .NET Aspire 13 — Simplified orchestration for cloud-native apps: https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement ASP.NET Core 10 — Modern, secure, and full-stack web development: https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025 .NET MAUI 10 — Build beautiful apps on every platform: https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025 C# 14 — A more expressive and productive language: https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025 F# 10 — Safer, faster, and more functional than ever: https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement Visual Studio 2026 — Faster, smarter, and built for the future: https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement .NET Conf 2025 — A global celebration of .NET innovation: https://aka.ms/dotnotconf2025/recap\n\nConnect with .NET: Blog: https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog Twitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter TikTok: https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok Mastodon: https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon LinkedIn: https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin Facebook: https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet Forums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums 🙋‍♀️Q&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa 👨‍🎓Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet"
