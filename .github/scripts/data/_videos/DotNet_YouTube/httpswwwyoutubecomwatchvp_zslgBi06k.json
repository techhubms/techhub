  "Description": "This session explains how Windows 365 global engineering teams utilizes .NET Aspire to support multi-repository microservices development with F5 experience (Clone, Build, and F5 Innovate). It introduces the AddMicroservice extension, which helps onboard and integrate microservices across different repositories with .NET Aspire, and the RunAsEmulator extension for loading dependencies from microservice containers or emulators. The built-in seed data feature facilitates local testing. Additionally, the use of HTTP file template-based microservice emulators is demonstrated, allowing teams to simulate various dependencies and scenarios. An end-to-end demonstration is provided to illustrate how Windows 365 can assist engineering teams with productivity and collaboration in cloud-native, multi-repository microservice world.\n\nSession: Windows 365 Meets .NET Aspire - Supercharging Multi-Repo Microservice Productivity\n\nWatch more .NET Conf 2025 videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oXtIlvq1tuORUtZqVG-HdCt",
