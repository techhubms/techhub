  "Description": "In Episode 4 of our Godot C# training series, we dive into the foundational building blocks of game development in Godot: scenes and nodes. You'll learn how to create your first level scene, add a ground plane with collision, and build a reusable player character complete with a third-person camera setup.\n\nThis hands-on walkthrough covers everything from node hierarchy and mesh setup to lighting and reusable scene instancing. By the end of this lesson, you'll have a playable scene with a controllable character and a camera that follows the action.\n\n‚úÖ What You'll Learn How scenes and nodes work together in Godot Creating a level scene with ground and collision Building a reusable player character using CharacterBody3D Setting up a third-person camera with SpringArm3D Adding directional lighting to your scene Using reusable scenes for efficient game design\n\n‚úÖ Resources GitHub repo with starter and final projects -https://github.com/microsoft/godot-csharp-essentials GoDot Website - https://godotengine.org/\n\n‚úÖ Challenge Create a new reusable obstacle scene that blocks player movement.
