  "Description": "Abstract: Gaea’s terrain engine powers some of the biggest productions in the world — from Star Wars, Star Trek, Alan Wake 2, Death Stranding to NASA's own simulations. Behind the beautiful, realistic terrain simulations is an engine that pushes .NET far beyond typical application workloads to handle billions of independent computations per build.\n\nThis session focuses on the architectural and low-level techniques that make this possible:\n\n- Designing modular terrain processing engine.\n- Implementing SPMD (Single Program, Multiple Data) execution in managed .NET code for massive-scale simulation.\n- Building a custom memory management system (Spawning Pool\") for predictable\n\nSession: High-Performance Terrain Simulations in .NET\n\nWatch more .NET Conf 2025 videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oXtIlvq1tuORUtZqVG-HdCt",
