  "Description": "Artificial intelligence is transforming how we approach testing and quality assurance. This session explores new AI-powered testing capabilities in Visual Studio that help you write better tests, identify edge cases, generate test data, and improve test coverage. Learn how AI assistance can suggest test cases based on your code, help with test maintenance as code evolves, and identify potential bugs before they reach production. Discover how these intelligent features integrate into your testing workflow, making it easier to build high-quality software with comprehensive test coverage. See how AI is making testing faster, smarter, and more effective.\n\n.NET 10 — The most intelligent and unified .NET yet: https://aka.ms/dotnet10/ .NET Aspire 13 — Simplified orchestration for cloud-native apps: https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement ASP.NET Core 10 — Modern, secure, and full-stack web development: https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025 .NET MAUI 10 — Build beautiful apps on every platform: https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025 C# 14 — A more expressive and productive language: https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025 F# 10 — Safer, faster, and more functional than ever: https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement Visual Studio 2026 — Faster, smarter, and built for the future: https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement .NET Conf 2025 — A global celebration of .NET innovation: https://aka.ms/dotnotconf2025/recap\n\nConnect with .NET: Blog: https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog Twitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter TikTok: https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok Mastodon: https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon LinkedIn: https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin Facebook: https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet Forums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums 🙋‍♀️Q&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa 👨‍🎓Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet",
