  "Description": "The testing experience in .NET is being transformed with the new Microsoft.Testing.Platform. This lightweight, modular testing platform provides an alternative to VSTest with significant benefits including faster test execution, Native AOT support, self-contained test executables, and greater flexibility. Learn how the new platform works with popular testing frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, and xUnit. Discover how tests can be packaged as standalone executables that run anywhere, enabling new deployment and execution scenarios. We'll explore the architecture, demonstrate the improvements, and show you how to take advantage of this new testing infrastructure in your projects.\n\n.NET 10 — The most intelligent and unified .NET yet: https://aka.ms/dotnet10/ .NET Aspire 13 — Simplified orchestration for cloud-native apps: https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement ASP.NET Core 10 — Modern, secure, and full-stack web development: https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025 .NET MAUI 10 — Build beautiful apps on every platform: https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025 C# 14 — A more expressive and productive language: https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025 F# 10 — Safer, faster, and more functional than ever: https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement Visual Studio 2026 — Faster, smarter, and built for the future: https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement .NET Conf 2025 — A global celebration of .NET innovation: https://aka.ms/dotnotconf2025/recap\n\nConnect with .NET: Blog: https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog Twitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter TikTok: https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok Mastodon: https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon LinkedIn: https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin Facebook: https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet Forums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums 🙋‍♀️Q&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa 👨‍🎓Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet",
