  "Description": "This week, Mark talks us through the challenges of building AiGen, the AI-powered coding assistant for Visual Studio, and what his team learned along the way. Most AI tools are chat-based but AiGen takes a different approach: a single question yields a single, seamlessly integrated code change—like pair programming with an expert who works at lightning speed. We’ll dig into how Mark and the team made that possible in C#, the design and UX decisions that mattered most, and the lessons any developer can apply when bringing AI into their own .NET apps.\n\n🎙️ Featuring: Mark Miller, Frank Boucher, David Pine\n\n#dotnet",
