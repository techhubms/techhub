  "Description": "Command lines never truly disappeared, but we must admit that while GUIs took center stage, the usage of command-line tools decreased. Now, in the age of cloud, DevOps, and automation, CLIs are making a powerful comeback. In this session, we’ll explore why command-line tools remain essential, how they’ve evolved, and why .NET is the perfect platform to build modern, cross-platform CLIs. By the end, you will learn about libraries, design patterns, and packaging strategies that can make CLI applications elegant, powerful, and portable.\n\n.NET 10 — The most intelligent and unified .NET yet: https://aka.ms/dotnet10/ .NET Aspire 13 — Simplified orchestration for cloud-native apps: https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement ASP.NET Core 10 — Modern, secure, and full-stack web development: https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025 .NET MAUI 10 — Build beautiful apps on every platform: https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025 C# 14 — A more expressive and productive language: https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025 F# 10 — Safer, faster, and more functional than ever: https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement Visual Studio 2026 — Faster, smarter, and built for the future: https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement .NET Conf 2025 — A global celebration of .NET innovation: https://aka.ms/dotnotconf2025/recap\n\nConnect with .NET: Blog: https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog Twitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter TikTok: https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok Mastodon: https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon LinkedIn: https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin Facebook: https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet Forums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums 🙋‍♀️Q&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa 👨‍🎓Microsoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet"
