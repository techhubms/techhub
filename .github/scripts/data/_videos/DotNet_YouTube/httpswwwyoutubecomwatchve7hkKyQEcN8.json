  "Description": "Build and release configuration as code has become the de facto approach for most continuous build and release solutions today. Most commonly, this is done through a custom task-based, debug-resistant domain-specific language using YAML or JSON files.\n\nBut what if, instead of using a markup language, you could use a proper programming language with well-defined and documented control structures, flow statements like for, while, and do, and the full expressive power of C#?\n\nIn this session, we will go step-by-step through how you can orchestrate your GitHub Actions build and release pipelines using C#, powered by the Cake SDK and the latest features of .NET 10. You will see how to test and debug your pipeline locally without the slow push-and-wait cycle for CI to fail or succeed. Using standard developer tools like VS Code, you can reuse the language skills your team already has, reducing friction and unnecessary context switching.\n\nSession: GitHub Actions DevOps Pipelines as Code using C# and Cake SDK\n\nWatch more .NET Conf 2025 videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oXtIlvq1tuORUtZqVG-HdCt",
