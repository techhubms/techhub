That’s the promise of a \"single-question, single-response\" model: AI as a trusted partner who just gets it done quickly and correctly.\n\nIn this session, Mark Miller (Chief Architect at DevExpress and creator of CodeRush & AiGen) shares lessons from building real-world AI agents in C#.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n\n\\* Why the one-question/one-answer + delta approach outperforms chat-based experiences. \\* How to feed AI the right context instantly for faster, more accurate results. \\* UX and design principles that apply to any AI-powered app—from coding assistants to productivity and enterprise tools. \\* Proven patterns for creating AI experiences that users actually love to use.\n\nWhether you’re curious about the future of pair programming or embedding AI into your own .NET apps, this talk will give you practical strategies to make AI agents more helpful, natural, and delightful.\n\nSession: One Question One Answer: Designing Seamless AI Agents with C#\n\nWatch more .NET Conf 2025 videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oXtIlvq1tuORUtZqVG-HdCt",
