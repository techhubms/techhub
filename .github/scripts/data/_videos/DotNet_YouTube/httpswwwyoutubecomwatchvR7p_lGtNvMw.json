With enterprise-grade tooling in Uno Platform Studio, developer productivity is elevated - Hot Design brings in runtime visual designer for .NET paired with Hot Reload, while Figma Plugins ease design to code workflows, all to tighten up developer inner loop. With the latest release, Uno Platform now embraces contextual AI with full human-in-the-loop control to supercharge modern .NET development. With grounded MCP Servers and custom AI Agents, developers can design/build/iterate on cross-platform .NET apps with context-aware AI that can see/interact with running apps - all from any choice of IDE or Agentic workflows.\n\n🔗 Community Links: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/8xymaztopj175z?source=docs\n\n🎙️Featuring: Bruno Capuano (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/bruno-capuano) Sam Basu (https://x.com/samidip) Jérôme Laban (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromelaban)\n\n#dotnet #AI #UnoPlatform #MCP"
