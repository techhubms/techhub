  "Description": "Most of us start building APIs using controllers in ASP.NET. It works fine at first, but as your application grows, controllers can get bloated, responsibilities blur, and tests become harder to write. In this session, I'll introduce the REPR pattern (Request, Endpoint, Response) as a lean, structured way to design APIs that scale cleanly. Using FastEndpoints, I'll show how this pattern helps separate concerns, improve readability, and keep your codebase maintainable over time. You'll see how to build focused endpoints, validate requests, return clean responses, and avoid the overhead that often comes with traditional controller-based APIs. Whether you're exploring FastEndpoints or just looking for a better way to structure your APIs, this session will give you practical guidance you can apply right away.\n\nüéôÔ∏è Featuring: Marcel Medina\n\n#dotnet #api",
