  "Description": "In Episode 7 of our Godot C# training series, we explore how to quickly prototype game environments using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) nodes. Prototyping is a vital step in game development ‚Äî it helps you test ideas, layout scenes, and iterate fast without worrying about polish.\n\nYou'll learn how to block out a room using CSG primitives, apply collision settings, and use operations like subtraction to create doors and openings. We also cover how to combine multiple shapes using the CSG Combiner node for efficient scene management. This episode is all about speed, flexibility, and testing your layout before committing to final assets.\n\n‚úÖ What You'll Learn How to use CSG nodes to build 3D environments Setting up snapping and transform tools for precision Applying collision detection to CSG shapes Using CSG operations: union, intersection, subtraction Creating reusable geometry with CSG Combiner Best practices for prototyping layout and flow\n\n‚úÖ Resources GitHub repo with starter and final projects -https://github.com/microsoft/godot-cs... GoDot Website - https://godotengine.org/\n\n‚úÖ Challenge Expand your scene by adding a second room and blocking out furniture like tables and chairs. Focus on layout and flow ‚Äî how easy is it to navigate and interact with the space?\n\n‚úÖ Chapters 00:04 - Why Prototyping Matters in Game Dev 00:28 - Using CSG Nodes to Build a Room 01:00 - Setting Up Snapping and Transform Tools 02:30 - Creating Walls and Aligning Geometry 04:00 - Enabling Collision Detection for CSG Shapes 05:25 - Using CSG Operations: Union, Subtraction, Intersection 06:45 - Cutting a Door into a Wall with Subtraction 08:00 - Combining Shapes with CSG Combiner 09:30 - Performance Tips and Prototyping Best Practices 10:04 - Challenge: Expand Your Scene with Furniture 10:36 - Wrap-Up and Preview of Object Interaction\n\n‚úÖ Hashtags #GodotEngine #CSharp #GameDevelopment #CSGNodes #Prototyping #LevelDesign #VisualStudioCode #IndieDev #LearnToCode #GameDevTools #MicrosoftDeveloper #DevEducation #EnvironmentDesign Connect with .NET: Blog: https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog Twitter: https://aka.ms/dotnet/twitter TikTok: https://aka.ms/dotnet/tiktok Mastodon: https://aka.ms/dotnet/mastodon LinkedIn: https://aka.ms/dotnet/linkedin Facebook: https://aka.ms/dotnet/facebook Docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet Forums: https://aka.ms/dotnet/forums üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èQ&A: https://aka.ms/dotnet-qa üë®‚ÄçüéìMicrosoft Learn: https://aka.ms/learndotnet\n\n#dotnet",
