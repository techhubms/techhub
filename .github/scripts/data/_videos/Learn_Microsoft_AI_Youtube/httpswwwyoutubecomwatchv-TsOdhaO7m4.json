By defining structured input classes, you can pass complex data into orchestrations in a type-safe manner, making your code more robust and easier to maintain. Similarly, agents and orchestrations can return structured outputs using custom classes, allowing your application to process rich, meaningful resultsâ€”not just plain text. You'll learn: How to define and use strongly-typed input and output classes Where to apply InputTransform and ResultTransform for custom handling This approach unlocks a more modular, scalable, and reliable way to build AI agent systems."
