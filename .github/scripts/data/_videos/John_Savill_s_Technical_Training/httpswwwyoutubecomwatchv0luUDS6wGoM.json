  "Description": "When people ask what I do on the weekend I'll often share that every Saturday after working out I spend 4-5 hours working on cleaning up my little 5 acres of forest where my family built our house. It is my favorite thing to do and it brings me true peace and calm. During this time, I never think of work, computers or really anything. Just trees .... and not falling off the ladder.\n\nI've been doing this every Saturday for the past 4 months or more. There are a LOT of fallen trees. Make sure you take time to find something for you!",
