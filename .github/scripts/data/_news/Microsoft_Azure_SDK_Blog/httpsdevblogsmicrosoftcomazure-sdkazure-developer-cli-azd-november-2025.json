  "EnhancedContent": "Welcome to the November 2025 edition of the Azure Developer CLI (`azd` ) release blog! This post covers releases 1.20.1 through 1.21.2. To share your feedback and questions, join the [November release discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/discussions/6155).\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n- Azure Container Apps support reaches **GA**\n- Layered provisioning enters **Beta**\n- Extension framework capabilities enhanced\n- Aspire 13 compatibility added\n- New community templates available for Azure Functions, Copilot Studio, and more\n\n## New features\n\n### 🚀 Extension Framework\n\n- **Custom ServiceConfig settings**: Extensions can now define custom service configuration settings to enable richer service behaviors, allowing authors to extend the service configuration model beyond the built-in properties and enabling custom workflows and integration patterns. [\\[#6013\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6013)\nFor example, an extension could define custom settings for specialized deployment scenarios or service-specific configurations that go beyond standard `azd` capabilities.\n- **Enhanced no-prompt support**: The prompt service now provides better support for non-interactive scenarios in extensions. When running with `--no-prompt`\nor in CI/CD environments, extensions can now gracefully handle user input requirements without failing, ensuring that `azd` workflows run smoothly in automated pipelines and headless environments and making extensions more reliable for production use cases. [\\[#6073\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6073)\n- **ServiceContext in lifecycle events**: Extensions can now access ServiceContext in service lifecycle events, providing richer context information for event handlers and enabling extensions to make more informed decisions during service provisioning and deployment. [\\[#6002\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6002)\n- **Language framework support**: Extensions can now register and provide language framework support, expanding `azd`\n‘s capabilities beyond built-in languages and opening up possibilities for supporting more programming languages and framework ecosystems through the extension model. [\\[#5847\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5847)\n- **Custom service target endpoints in azd show**: The `azd show`\ncommand now displays endpoints from custom service targets provided by extensions, improving visibility into services deployed through extension-provided targets and giving developers a complete picture of their deployed resources regardless of the deployment method. [\\[#6074\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6074)\n- **AccountService gRPC API**: `azd`\nadded a new AccountService gRPC API and server implementation, providing programmatic access to account-related operations. Extensions can now integrate with account management workflows more easily. [\\[#5995\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5995)\n\n### 🚀 Aspire\n\n- **Aspire 13 support**: `azd`\nnow supports `Aspire 13` , ensuring compatibility with the latest Aspire features and improvements. Developers can now use new Aspire capabilities while maintaining seamless integration with `azd` workflows. [\\[#6093\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6093)\n- **.NET 10 support in auto-generated pipeline configs**: Pipeline configuration now includes `.NET 10`\nin auto-generated templates, ensuring your CI/CD pipelines are ready for the latest .NET runtime. [\\[#6133\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6133)\n- **Aspire Dashboard URL for App Service deployments**: When deploying Aspire applications to Azure App Service, `azd`\nnow displays the Aspire dashboard URL, making it easier to monitor and manage your deployed applications. [\\[#5881\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5881)\n\n### 🚀 Prepublish and postpublish hooks\n\n- **Prepublish and postpublish hooks**: The v1.0 `azure.yaml`\nschema now supports `prepublish` and `postpublish` hooks, giving developers more control over the publishing workflow. These hooks enable custom pre-processing and post-processing steps during container image publishing. [\\[#5841\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5841)\n\n### 🚀 Azure Container Apps\n\n- **Runtime environment variable management**: Container Apps deployments now support the `env`\nproperty in `azure.yaml` for managing runtime environment variables. This feature allows you to merge environment variables during deployment, providing better control over your container configuration without modifying infrastructure code. [\\[#6154\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6154)\n\n## Bugs fixed\n\n- Fixed Container App resource existence checks that were returning incorrect results [\\[#5939\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5939)\n- Improved error messaging when the `--environment`\nflag is missing [\\[#5930\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5930)\n- Fixed hyperlink ANSI escape codes appearing in non-terminal output [\\[#6015\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6015)\n- Resolved flickering progress bar during agent deployment operations [\\[#6032\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6032)\n- Fixed lifetime management issues with extension container helpers [\\[#6028\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6028)\n- Environment values are now properly reloaded before loading parameters in the bicep provider [\\[#6063\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6063)\n- Fixed remote build functionality on the agent extension [\\[#6098\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6098)\n- Fixed project-level events not being invoked from extensions [\\[#5964\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5964)\n- Fixed concurrent map write panics in FrameworkService [\\[#5985\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5985)\n- Prevented index out of range panics in `progressLog.Write()`\n[\\[#6001\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6001)\n- Fixed duplicate event registration in workflow commands [\\[#6012\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6012)\n\n## Other changes\n\n- Hook warnings are now logged to the log file instead of being displayed in the console, reducing console noise while maintaining visibility for troubleshooting [\\[#6083\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6083)\n- `azd`\ncompletion support added to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_106#_terminal-intellisense)\n\n## New docs & blog\n\nThe Azure Developer CLI documentation received several important updates this month:\n\n- **[Container App deployment documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/container-apps-workflows)** (November 12, 2025): Updated documentation on deploying to Azure Container Apps with new revision-based deployment information.\n- **[GitHub Copilot coding agent extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/extensions/copilot-coding-agent-extension)** (October 21, 2025): New guide for connecting GitHub Copilot coding agent with Azure MCP Server using the `azd`\ncoding agent extension.\n- **[Customize workflows using hooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-extensibility)** (October 20, 2025): Updated documentation with `prepublish`\nand `postpublish` hooks.\n\nIn addition to these documentation updates, we published a new blog post in our “Dev to production” series. After reading [our first](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-developer-cli-from-dev-to-prod-with-one-click/) and [second](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-developer-cli-from-dev-to-prod-with-azure-devops-pipelines/) blog and you wondered: “So what?
