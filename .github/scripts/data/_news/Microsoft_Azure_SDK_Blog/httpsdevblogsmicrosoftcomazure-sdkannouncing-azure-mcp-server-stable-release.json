[Azure MCP server](https://aka.ms/azmcp/docs) 1.0 is now officially available as a stable release! If you‚Äôre a developer, an AI enthusiast, or just someone who loves seeing what‚Äôs possible when cloud and intelligence collide, this is your moment. This release brings together months of rapid innovation, deep collaboration, and relentless focus on empowering AI agents and developers to harness the full power of Azure services through the open [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.info/) (MCP).\n\n## What is Azure MCP server\n\nAzure MCP server is an [open-source](https://aka.ms/azmcp) implementation of the MCP specification, designed to bridge AI agents and cloud resources with a ‚Äúwrite once‚Äù approach. It brings together Azure‚Äôs rich set of services across major cloud verticals, including AI services like Azure AI Foundry and AI Search, database services such as Postgres and Kusto, messaging services like Event Hubs and Service Bus, compute services such as Function Apps, and core infrastructure services like Resource Groups. Alongside these, it supports many ancillary capabilities including App Configuration, Storage, Log Analytics, and many more, Azure MCP server enables agents to query, manage, and automate cloud workflows using natural language and code. Whether you‚Äôre building with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, custom MCP clients, or frameworks like Agent Framework, Azure MCP server is your gateway to agentic cloud automation.\n\n## Why this release matters\n\nLet‚Äôs rewind. A few months ago, Azure MCP server was a just an idea, what if AI agents could tap into the full power of Azure, securely and seamlessly, using an MCP as a universal protocol? Fast forward to today, and that vision is real‚Äîopen-source, production-ready, and already making waves across the developer community. MCP is the ‚Äúlingua franca‚Äù for agents and cloud resources. With Azure MCP server, your agents can:\n\n- Query databases with natural language\n- Manage storage, logs, and configs\n- Run CLI commands and automate deployments\n\nMoreover, do it all with the security, scale, and reliability of Azure, it‚Äôs not just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a platform for building the next generation of intelligent, context-aware apps.\n\n## What‚Äôs new and exciting in 1.0 stable release\n\nAzure MCP server 1.0 stable release is the result of a whirlwind of creativity, feedback, and real-world developer needs. Over the past few months, we have been heads down building and listening to early feedback. The result? A platform that feels like it‚Äôs built for you‚Äîbecause it is.\n\nWe have expanded support to more than [47 Azure services](https://aka.ms/azmcp/supported-services), and the integration story is better than ever. Whether you‚Äôre coding in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or IntelliJ, Azure MCP server is right there with you, woven into the tools you already use every day. If you‚Äôre working in modern DevOps environments, you‚Äôll love that MCP is now available as a Docker image and on Microsoft Container Registry (MCR). That means you can pull it straight into your CI/CD pipelines or spin up agentic workflows in containers with just a few commands.\n\nOne of the biggest changes you notice is how much simpler everything feels. We took over 170 tools and streamlined them, making it easier to find what you need, faster to get started, and less overwhelming for everyone. Now, you can focus on building and experimenting, not hunting through endless menus or documentation.\n\nBut maybe the most exciting part is what you can actually do. Imagine telling GitHub Copilot to ‚Äú[build and deploy a photo gallery app](https://youtu.be/HPvXjrxOPcI),‚Äù and watching as Azure MCP server orchestrates storage, containers, monitoring, and deployment‚Äîwhile you stay in your creative flow. This isn‚Äôt a far-off dream. It‚Äôs happening now, and it‚Äôs only the beginning.\n\n## Under the hood\n\nAzure MCP server consolidates over 170 tools, streamlining similar operations and verbs for simplicity and discoverability. Each tool now features clear descriptions and parameters, and you can run the Azure MCP server in flexible modes, `namespace` (the default, grouping tools logically for easier discovery), `all` tools, or `single` tool modes, so you can tailor your experience for onboarding, debugging, or scaling up. Namespace mode, in particular, reduces the initial load of discovering and selecting the right tool for your agent.\n\nService coverage is broad and deep. With Kusto, you can list accounts, query databases, manage containers, and execute queries. Azure Storage lets you upload, download, organize, and secure your data, while Log Analytics enables you to run KQL queries, monitor health, and troubleshoot in seconds. App Configuration, Resource Groups, the Azure CLI, and Azure Developer CLI (azd) are all agent-ready, giving you the full Azure toolkit at your fingertips.\n\nSecurity, trust, and performance are at the core of this release. Tools that handle sensitive data now require user confirmation before execution, giving you full control and safeguarding your credentials. Every update is backed by Microsoft‚Äôs rigorous security processes, including threat modeling, AI security assessments, Responsible AI reviews, and SDL compliance, so you can innovate with confidence. Performance is also a major focus, with .NET Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, Azure MCP server starts up faster and uses less space, helping you get to work without delay.\n\n## The Ecosystem\n\nPlug-and-play integration is at the heart of Azure MCP server‚Äôs ecosystem. We offer extensions for all your favorite IDEs including VS Code, Visual Studio, and IntelliJ, so you can get started right where you work. Even more convenience is on the way, with Azure MCP server soon to be available natively alongside the Azure Extension in Visual Studio 2026.\n\nOur reach doesn‚Äôt stop at just IDEs. Azure MCP server is featured in other marketplaces like Cline, and we‚Äôre continually expanding our integration footprint. For those people working in DevOps or containerized environments, MCP is also available as a Docker image, making it easier than ever to bring agentic workflows into your pipelines and modern development stacks.\n\n## Get Started & Stay Connected\n\n- GitHub Repo: [aka.ms/azmcp](https://aka.ms/azmcp)\n- Documentation: [aka.ms/azmcp/docs](https://aka.ms/azmcp/docs)\n- VS Code Extension: [aka.ms/azmcp/download/vscode](https://aka.ms/azmcp/download/vscode)\n- Visual Studio Extension: [aka.ms/azmcp/download/vs](https://aka.ms/azmcp/download/vs)\n- IntelliJ Plugin: [aka.ms/azmcp/download/intellij](https://aka.ms/azmcp/download/intellij)\n- Docker Image: [aka.ms/azmcp/download/docker](https://aka.ms/azmcp/download/docker)\n- Create an Issue: [aka.ms/azmcp/issues](https://aka.ms/azmcp/issues)\n\n## Thank You!\n\nAzure MCP server 1.0 is built on your feedback and collaboration.
