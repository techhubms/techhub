The following features and improvements have been recently released in Visual Studio version 17.14 Preview 3. (Remember, preview versions of Visual Studio can be run side by side with the main releases)\n\n## A guided Walkthrough for getting started\n\nIf you’re new to GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio and are looking for a quick, guided way to get started, this feature is for you. Head to the GitHub Copilot badge dropdown and select GitHub Copilot Walkthrough. This will launch the walkthrough as a new tab in your workspace.\n\nThis five-step walkthrough will show you how to get Copilot for free, introduce you to AI-powered code completions, Copilot Chat, show you how to provide Copilot with specific context about your solution, and introduce you to the multi-file editing power of Copilot Edits. Once you complete these steps, you should be ready to start using and experimenting with Copilot.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/WalkthroughP3.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/WalkthroughP3.mp4)\n\n## Improved model access and Code Mapping\n\nIt’s also now easier than ever to access the latest models like Claude 3.7 from within Visual Studio. Instead of needing to adjust your settings, you can now enable any of the available models from github.com directly through Visual Studio. When you select your model within Copilot Chat, you will be prompted to enable your chosen model.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/ModelApprovalP3.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/ModelApprovalP3.mp4)\n\nHow and where Copilot inserts its code suggestions into your code in the right place has also gotten an upgrade in this release with improvements to what we call “Code Mapping”.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/CodeMappingP3.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/CodeMappingP3.mp4)\n\n## Copilot can suggest the next edit and fix pasted code automatically\n\nWe also have some exciting updates coming to the Code Completion experience that will allow Copilot to better understand your intention as you’re writing code and enhance its ability to assist you with editing your code. The feature is called Next Edit Suggestions, which helps developers by providing contextual suggestions for code edits based on previous changes.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/NESP3.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/NESP3.mp4)\n\nAnother feature to watch out for is adaptive paste which automatically adjusts code you paste into Visual Studio to fit the context of your existing code, minimizing the need for manual modifications. This feature also supports scenarios such as minor error fixes, code styling, formatting, human and code language translation, and fill-in-the-blank or continue-the-pattern tasks.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/AdaptivePasteP3.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/AdaptivePasteP3.mp4)\n\nLearn more about these features in the preview 3 release notes: [Visual Studio 2022 Preview Release Notes | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-preview?tabs=allfeatures)\n\n## Try the latest Preview\n\nIf you’d like to see any of these features in action and stay up to date with the latest Copilot updates, try out [the preview version of Visual Studio](https://aka.ms/visualstudio/preview).\n\n## Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place! Visit the [Visual Studio Hub](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/hub/) for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions.\n\n## Appreciation for your feedback\n\nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers.
