Subscribe to our [Azure SDK Blog RSS Feed](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/feed/) to get notified when a new release is available.\n\nYou can find links to packages, code, and docs on our [Azure SDK Releases page](https://aka.ms/azsdk/releases).\n\n## Give feedback\n\nIf you’ve been using the Azure SDK, we’d love to hear your thoughts! Take a moment to [complete the survey](https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog-survey)!\n\n## Release highlights\n\nAccording to the official Node.js [release timeline](https://nodejs.org/about/previous-releases), Node.js 18 will reach its official end-of-life on April 30, 2025 and will no longer receive security updates and critical bug fixes. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version to ensure continued support.\n\nAs a reminder, the Azure SDK libraries aren’t guaranteed to work on platforms and with other dependencies that are deemed end of life. Dropping support for such dependencies may be done without increasing the major version of the Azure SDK libraries. We strongly recommend migration to supported platforms and other dependencies to be eligible for technical support.\n\n### Initial stable releases\n\n- **Management Library for .NET**\n- Compute Schedule\n- IoT Operations\n- **Management Library for Go**\n- Compute Schedule\n- **Management Library for Java**\n- Compute Schedule\n- **Client Library for Java**\n- HTTPClient – JDK\n- HTTPClient – VertX\n- **Management Library for JavaScript**\n- Compute Schedule\n- **Management Library for Python**\n- Compute Schedule\n\n### Initial Beta releases\n\n- **Client Library for Java**\n- Open Telemetry Auto Configure\n- **Management Library for Go**\n- Pinecone Vector DB\n- **Management Library for Java**\n- Pinecone Vector DB\n- **Management Library for JavaScript**\n- Pinecone Vector DB\n- **Management Library for Python**\n- Pinecone Vector DB\n\n## Release notes\n\n- [All languages](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/index.html)\n- [.NET](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/dotnet.html)\n- [Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/java.html)\n- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/js.html)\n- [Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/python.html)\n- [Go](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/go.html)\n- [C++](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/cpp.html)\n- [Embedded C](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/c.html)\n- [Android](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/android.html)\n- [iOS](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-02/ios.html)",
