  "EnhancedContent": "Since we announced the Public Preview of the [Azure MCP Server](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/introducing-the-azure-mcp-server/) last month, the team released more features and integrations. This post covers the recent updates and new features of the Azure MCP Server.\n\n## Microsoft Learn documentation\n\nWe released a new [documentation hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-mcp-server/) on Microsoft Learn that covers getting started scenarios in VS Code and with the .NET and Python MCP libraries. Expect more guides and content in the future as we continue building the Azure MCP Server!\n\n## Service integrations\n\nIn addition, we partnered with many teams across Azure to build MCP functionality for you. Here’s a list!\n\n### Azure AI Search\n\n[Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/) is a powerful search service that uses AI to provide rich, full-text search and indexing on your data. You can use Azure AI Search to perform semantic search, natural language processing, and vector similarity for your intelligent apps.\n\nIn partnership with the Azure AI Search team, we added support for:\n\n- Listing AI Search Services\n- Listing Indexes\n- Describing Indexes\n- Querying and Searching Indexes\n\n### Azure Database for PostgreSQL\n\n[Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/) is a fully managed PostgreSQL database service that offers built-in high availability, automated backups, and enterprise-grade security. It’s optimized for both performance and cost efficiency, and is designed to empower developers to build intelligent, scalable, AI-powered applications.\n\nIn partnership with the Azure Database for PostgreSQL team, we added support for:\n\n- Listing Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible servers in a given resource group\n- Retrieving server configurations, including PostgreSQL version, compute, storage, and backup settings\n- Accessing specific server parameters\n- Listing databases in a server instance\n- Listing tables in a database\n- Accessing schema information for tables in a database\n- Executing read queries to retrieve data from a database\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the Azure Database for PostgreSQL integration with the Azure MCP Server, take a look at this [blog post!](https://aka.ms/azure-mcp-postgresql).\n\n### Azure Key Vault – Keys\n\n[Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/) allows you to securely manage secrets, keys, and certificates in the cloud.\n\nWe implemented an integration for Azure Key Vault Keys, adding support for:\n\n- Listing Keys\n- Getting Keys\n- Creating Keys\n\n### Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)\n\n[Azure Data Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/), also known as Kusto, is a fully managed data analytics service optimized for large-scale analysis of logs and telemetry.\n\nIn partnership with the Azure Data Explorer team, we added support for:\n\n- Listing Kusto clusters in a subscription\n- Accessing details for a Kusto cluster\n- Listing databases within a cluster\n- Listing tables in a Kusto database\n- Retrieving schemas for a particular Kusto table\n- Executing Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries against databases\n- Sampling data from a particular Kusto table\n\n### Azure Service Bus\n\n[Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/) is a fully managed message broker that enables reliable communication between distributed applications and services.\n\nWe’ve implemented an integration for Azure Service Bus, adding support for:\n\n- Peeking messages in a Service Bus Queue\n- Peeking messages in a Service Bus Subscription within a topic\n- Getting runtime details on a Service Bus Queue\n- Getting runtime details on a Service Bus topic\n- Getting runtime details and message counts for a Service Bus subscription\n\n## Other changes\n\nOn top of our feature integrations, we fixed bugs, improved tools, and added an Azure Developer Best Practices Tool via a collaboration with the [GitHub Copilot for Azure](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azure-github-copilot) team. This tool provides guidance to agents for effective code generation.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the past month, we made a lot of progress on updating the Azure MCP Server. Special thanks to all of the individuals and teams we partnered with to ship our improvements! We’re looking forward to the future as we continue to build out the Azure MCP Server.\n\nFor more information, see [Azure MCP Server on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/).",
