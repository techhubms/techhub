  "EnhancedContent": "## A Tool Built for Developers by Developers\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that Kiota now supports Dart, and this milestone is special as it marks the first language added to Kiota that was entirely driven by the community. This new feature is available in public preview, and we could not be more excited to share it with you!\n\n## A Heartfelt Thanks to the Community\n\nWe would like to extend our deepest gratitude to the community members who contributed to adding Dart support to Kiota, [Kees-Schotanus](https://github.com/Kees-Schotanus), [Joanne ter Maat](https://github.com/joanne-ter-maat), [Ricardo Boss](https://github.com/ricardoboss), [Andrea Peruffo](https://github.com/andreaTP) and [Emond Papegaaij](https://github.com/papegaaij). Your dedication and hard work have made this achievement possible, and we are incredibly grateful for your efforts.\n\nWe look forward to more community-driven innovations in the future. Keep them coming!\n\n## What is Kiota?\n\nKiota automates the creation of both API plugins for declarative agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot and API client libraries and revolutionizes the way developers consume APIs. Imagine effortlessly generating robust, type-safe client libraries for multiple programming languages, now including Dart! Kiota transforms complex API interactions into seamless, efficient processes, saving you time and reducing errors. The integration of Dart enables developers to build powerful API clients for their Dart applications with ease and precision.\n\n## Why Kiota?\n\nKiota automates the tedious process of writing API clients, allowing you to focus on building features and solving problems. By generating API clients tailored to your application with strong typing, Kiota improves performance, reduces runtime errors and makes your code more reliable. This customization not only streamlines the development process but also ensures that the generated client library is lean and efficient. The addition of Dart support showcases the power of community collaboration, ensuring that the tool evolves to meet developers’ needs while having Microsoft support to incorporate community contributions to the product.\n\n## Getting Started with Kiota and Dart\n\nTo get started with Kiota and Dart, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Install Kiota\n\nFirst, you need to install Kiota.\n\n![InstallKiota.jpeg](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/openapi/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2025/01/InstallKiota.jpeg)\n\nThere are several ways to install Kiota depending on your preferred setup. You can run Kiota in a Docker container, as a [.NET tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools), and more. For comprehensive installation instructions, how to use Kiota, and additional information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://aka.ms/kiota/docs).\n\n### Step 2: Generate the API Client\n\nOnce Kiota is installed, you can generate an API client by providing your OpenAPI description file.\n\nOpen the Kiota extension by clicking on the Kiota icon in the Active Bar on the side and add an API description.\n\n![AddAPIDescription.png](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/openapi/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2025/01/AddAPIDescription.png)\n\nFollow the steps in the extension to search for a public API in Kiota’s Catalog or provide a path to a local or remote OpenAPI description, select all desired paths and click on Generate.\n\n![Generate.png](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/openapi/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2025/01/Generate.png)\n\nProvide all the following required information and in the end, choose the Dart language.\n\n![LanguageSelection.png](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/openapi/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2025/01/LanguageSelection.png)\n\nFor information on how to use the CLI and more detailed documentation, please refer to the [build API clients for Dart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openapi/kiota/quickstarts/dart).\n\n### Step 3: Using the Generated API Client\n\nAfter generating the API client, you can use it in your Dart application. Here is an example of how to call your API using API Key:\n\n## Next Steps\n\n### Try out the new version today!\n\nWe are excited about the new Dart support in Kiota. Please try it out and [share your feedback with us](https://aka.ms/kiota). Your insights and suggestions are invaluable for improving Kiota Dart support. Happy coding!\n\n### OAuth authentication provider\n\nImplementing OAuth will ensure that one’s application can securely and seamless call APIs that require user authentication. Once this is implemented, gathering feedback, and implementing improvements to ensure it meets users’ needs effectively are crucial.\n\n### Contribute to Kiota\n\nConsider contributing to the Kiota project by reporting bugs, suggesting features, or even submitting pull requests. Contributions from the community will help make Kiota a more robust and inclusive tool for everyone. Encouraging continuous contributions, reviewing feedback, implementing changes, and fostering an active community involvement cycle are essential for the project’s ongoing success and improvement.\n\n### General Availability\n\nAs we move towards the General Availability (GA) release of Dart support in Kiota, continued usage and testing of the new features by the community are encouraged. Your feedback and support are crucial in refining and finalizing the Dart support for Kiota. Even after the GA release, it is important to continue gathering user feedback, making iterative improvements, and ensuring the support remains robust and effective.",
