It works with both cloud endpoints and OSS/local backends so you can prototype and ship from the same editor.\n\n- GPT-5 models available via AI Toolkit for experimentation and integration.\n- Supports GPT OSS and cloud/local development.\n- Announcement / docs: [GPT-5 Family of Models & GPT OSS Are Now Available in AI Toolkit for VS Code](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredevcommunityblog/gpt-5-family-of-models--gpt-oss-are-now-available-in-ai-toolkit-for-vs-code/4441394)\n\n### Azure AI Foundry\n\n**Important**\n\nAccess to gpt-5 in Azure AI Foundry requires registration ([apply here](https://aka.ms/oai/gpt5access)). gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, and gpt-5-chat do not require registration. GPT-5 models are currently available in East US 2 and Sweden Central (Global Standard & Data Zones); see [Azure OpenAI models: GPT-5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-5).\n\n- GPT-5 models available with enterprise-grade security and model routing.\n- Supports long-running agentic tasks with [structured outputs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/structured-outputs) and reasoning capabilities.\n- Regional availability: GPT-5 models are currently available in East US 2 and Sweden Central (Global Standard & Data Zones). See [Azure OpenAI models: GPT-5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-5).\n- Access: [Registration required for gpt-5](https://aka.ms/oai/gpt5access); gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, and gpt-5-chat do not require registration.\n- Full capabilities: [Azure OpenAI reasoning models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/reasoning).\n- Announcement / docs: [Microsoft incorporates OpenAI’s GPT-5 into consumer, developer and enterprise offerings](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/openai-gpt-5/)\n\n### GitHub Models\n\n- Supports gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-chat.\n- Marketplace: [Models · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models)\n\n### Microsoft Copilot Studio\n\n- Makers can select GPT-5 models for agent orchestration.\n- Supports GPT-5 Chat and GPT-5 Reasoning with auto-routing.\n- Announcement / docs: [Available today: GPT-5 in Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-copilot-studio/)\n\n### Microsoft 365 Copilot\n\n- GPT-5 powers Copilot Chat with smarter orchestration, improved reasoning, and multimodal capabilities.\n- Users can opt-in via “Try GPT-5” button.\n- Announcement / docs: [Available today: GPT-5 in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n### OpenAI .NET SDK\n\n- Official .NET library supports GPT-5 via the Responses API, including streaming and reasoning with configurable reasoning effort.\n- Guide: [How to use responses with streaming and reasoning](https://github.com/openai/openai-dotnet#how-to-use-responses-with-streaming-and-reasoning)\n- NuGet: [OpenAI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenAI)\n\n### C# example: streaming with reasoning effort\n\n```cs using OpenAI.Responses;\n\nOpenAIResponseClient client = new( model: \"gpt-5\", apiKey: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") );\n\nawait foreach (var update in client.CreateResponseStreamingAsync( userInputText: \"Explain beta-reduction in lambda calculus.\", new ResponseCreationOptions { ReasoningOptions = new ResponseReasoningOptions { ReasoningEffortLevel = ResponseReasoningEffortLevel.High, }, })) { if (update is StreamingResponseContentPartDeltaUpdate delta) { Console.Write(delta.Text); } } ```\n\n### Python example: reasoning effort and verbosity\n\nThis sample demonstrates GPT-5’s controllable response behavior using the new `reasoning_effort` and `verbosity` parameters, allowing developers to fine-tune how deeply the model thinks and how much it says.\n\n```py import os\n\nimport openai from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider\n\nclient = openai.AzureOpenAI( api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_VERSION\"], azure_endpoint=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"], azure_ad_token_provider=get_bearer_token_provider(DefaultAzureCredential(), \"https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\"), )\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create( model=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT\"], messages=[ {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Explain beta-reduction in lambda calculus.\"}, ], reasoning_effort=\"minimal\", verbosity=\"low\" ) print(response.choices[0].message. Content) ```\n\n### JavaScript example: GPT-5 structured output (JSON schema)\n\nThis JavaScript sample highlights GPT-5’s ability to return structured, schema-conforming JSON using the new `response_format` parameter with a custom JSON Schema—making it easy to extract reasoning steps and final answers with full type safety. It also demonstrates seamless integration with Azure Foundry endpoints for secure, production-grade deployments.\n\n```js import { AzureOpenAI } from \"openai\"; import dotenv from \"dotenv\";\n\ndotenv.config();\n\nconst endpoint = process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT; // Foundry project endpoint const key = process.env.AZURE_INFERENCE_KEY; // API key const deployment = process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT || \"gpt-5\";\n\nconst client = new AzureOpenAI({ endpoint, apiKey: key, apiVersion: \"2025-01-01-preview\", deployment, });\n\nconst schema = { name: \"math_explanation\", schema: { type: \"object\", properties: { steps: { type: \"array\", items: { type: \"string\" } }, answer: { type: \"number\" }, }, required: [\"steps\", \"answer\"], additionalProperties: false, }, strict: true, };\n\nconst result = await client.chat.completions.create({ model: deployment, messages: [ { role: \"system\", content: \"Return JSON only.\" }, { role: \"user\", content: \"What is 23 * 7? Show your steps.\" }, ], response_format: { type: \"json_schema\", json_schema: schema }, });\n\nconst content = result.choices[0].message?.content ?? \"{}\"; const data = JSON.parse(content); console.log(\"Steps:\", data.steps); console.log(\"Answer:\", data.answer); ```\n\nOutput:\n\n```default Example output for \"What is 23 * 7? Show your steps.\":\n\nSteps: [ 'Break 23 into 20 and 3: (20 + 3) * 7', 'Multiply: 20 * 7 = 140', 'Multiply: 3 * 7 = 21', 'Add the results: 140 + 21 = 161' ] Answer: 161 ```\n\n### Python: RAG Chat Sample\n\nLooking for a full sample? Check out the Azure Search + OpenAI RAG chat app in Python: [RAG chat app with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search (Python)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/). It includes a Python backend and React frontend, sample data, and quick start paths (Codespaces, Dev Containers, or azd) so you can deploy and test fast. The docs also cover evaluation and production hardening.\n\nIt’s updated for GPT‑5: switch the chat model and version via environment variables, then redeploy. See “Using different chat completion models” and “Using reasoning models” in the sample’s docs for exact settings.\n\n### Java: OpenAI SDK for Java\n\nThe [OpenAI SDK for Java 3.0.0](https://github.com/openai/openai-java/releases/tag/v3.0.0) release adds support for GPT-5 and new API features.\n\n```java import com.openai.client.OpenAIClient; import com.openai.client.okhttp.OpenAIOkHttpClient; import com.openai.models.ChatModel; import com.openai.models.responses.Response; import com.openai.models.responses.ResponseCreateParams;\n\n// Configures using the `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_ORG_ID` and `OPENAI_PROJECT_ID` environment variables OpenAIClient client = OpenAIOkHttpClient.fromEnv();\n\nResponseCreateParams params = ResponseCreateParams.builder() .input(\"Say this is a test\") .model(ChatModel.GPT_5) .build(); Response response = client.responses().create(params); ```\n\n## Evaluate and compare models\n\nWhen you adopt GPT-5, validate quality and cost for your domain with side-by-side evaluation.\n\n- Azure AI Foundry: Run playground comparisons and batch evaluations with the Azure AI Evaluation SDK. See [Azure OpenAI reasoning models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/reasoning)\nand the evaluation SDK: [azure-ai-evaluation (GitHub)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/evaluation/azure-ai-evaluation).\n- GitHub Models: Quickly try GPT-5 family variants (gpt-5, mini, nano, chat) in the marketplace and your IDE to test latency and output quality. See\n[Models · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models).\n\nFor .NET apps, when you evaluate or switch to GPT-5, keep quality checks consistent across unit tests and CI by using Microsoft.Extensions.AI Evaluation. It provides quality, safety, and NLP evaluators with caching and reporting to help you spot regressions before rollout. See [The Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation libraries (Learn)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/conceptual/evaluation-libraries) and the blog [Exploring Agent Quality and NLP evaluators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/exploring-agent-quality-and-nlp-evaluators/).\n\n**Tip**\n\nPrefer structured outputs for easier, automated checks (schema validation), and evaluate with groundedness and relevance metrics on your own datasets before switching defaults.\n\n## What we’ve been building\n\nWe’ve been experimenting with GPT-5 across Microsoft and the open-source community. Here are two highlights from the past week:\n\n### Pamela Fox — Evaluating GPT-5 for RAG\n\n- Blog: [GPT-5: Will it RAG?](https://blog.pamelafox.org/2025/08/gpt-5-will-it-rag.html)\n- A deep dive into evaluation setup and early takeaways for GPT-5 on retrieval-augmented generation.\n\n### Anthony Shaw — GitHub Models CLI updates\n\n- Repo: [tonybaloney/llm-github-models](https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models)\n- Updated to work with the GPT-5 family via GitHub Models, making it easy to test prompts and workflows from the command line.\n\nTony also wrote up a big blog post on [Using an LLM in GitHub Actions](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/using-llm-in-github-actions.html). He explores how to integrate a large language model directly into GitHub Actions workflows, enabling automated reasoning, code review, and decision-making within CI pipelines. He walks through setting up a custom action that invokes an LLM via API, discusses practical use cases like summarizing PRs or validating commit messages, and highlights the potential for AI-assisted automation in developer tooling. It’s a hands-on look at bringing GPT-powered intelligence into everyday DevOps.\n\n### Burke Holland — Vibe coding with GPT-5 in VS Code\n\nBurke tries some “vibe coding” with GPT-5 in Visual Studio Code—he has GPT-5 build a working website while he goes to eat dinner, and it does a pretty good job. The design looks pretty nice, too. [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqc85X2rpEY)\n\nBurke also tried an experiment where he asked GPT-5 to create an “aesthetically pleasing game” three times, with [three different results](https://polite-sea-05be72110.2.azurestaticapps.net/).\n\n## Quick reference table\n\n| Product / Service | GPT-5 Integration Highlights | Announcement / Documentation | | --- | --- | --- | | 💻 Visual Studio Code | GPT-5 via AI Toolkit; supports GPT OSS and cloud/local development. | [GPT-5 Family of Models & GPT OSS Are Now Available in AI Toolkit for VS Code](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredevcommunityblog/gpt-5-family-of-models--gpt-oss-are-now-available-in-ai-toolkit-for-vs-code/4441394) • [GitHub Copilot in VS Code – July release (v1.103)](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-07-github-copilot-in-vs-code-july-release-v1-103/) • [GPT-5 mini](https://aka.ms/vscode-github-changelog-gpt5-mini) | | 🤖 GitHub Copilot | Enhanced coding with GPT-5 for longer and more complex tasks; integrated into VS Code and GitHub. | [GitHub Copilot in VS Code – July release (v1.103)](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-07-github-copilot-in-vs-code-july-release-v1-103/) • [OpenAI GPT-5 is now available in public preview in Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-12-openai-gpt-5-is-now-available-in-public-preview-in-visual-studio-jetbrains-ides-xcode-and-eclipse) • [GPT-5 mini in Copilot for VS Code](https://aka.ms/vscode-github-changelog-gpt5-mini) | | ☁️ Azure AI Foundry | Enterprise-grade GPT-5 with security, model routing, and structured outputs. | [Azure OpenAI models: GPT-5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-5) • [Registration for gpt-5 access](https://aka.ms/oai/gpt5access) • [Reasoning models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/reasoning) | | 🧬 GitHub Models | gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-chat. | [Models · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models) | | 🛠️ Microsoft Copilot Studio | Makers can select GPT-5 models for agent orchestration; GPT-5 Chat and Reasoning with auto-routing. | [Available today: GPT-5 in Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-copilot-studio/) | | 📄 Microsoft 365 Copilot | GPT-5 powers Copilot Chat with smarter orchestration, improved reasoning, and multimodal capabilities.

Show your steps.\":\n\nSteps: [ 'Break 23 into 20 and 3: (20 + 3) * 7', 'Multiply: 20 * 7 = 140', 'Multiply: 3 * 7 = 21', 'Add the results: 140 + 21 = 161' ] Answer: 161 ```\n\n### More code: RAG Chat with Python\n\nLooking for a full sample? Check out the Azure Search + OpenAI RAG chat app in Python: [RAG chat app with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search (Python)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo/). It includes a Python backend and React frontend, sample data, and quick start paths (Codespaces, Dev Containers, or azd) so you can deploy and test fast. The docs also cover evaluation and production hardening.\n\nIt’s updated for GPT‑5: switch the chat model and version via environment variables, then redeploy. See “Using different chat completion models” and “Using reasoning models” in the sample’s docs for exact settings.\n\n## Evaluate and compare models\n\nWhen you adopt GPT-5, validate quality and cost for your domain with side-by-side evaluation.\n\n- Azure AI Foundry: Run playground comparisons and batch evaluations with the Azure AI Evaluation SDK. See [Azure OpenAI reasoning models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/reasoning)\nand the evaluation SDK: [azure-ai-evaluation (GitHub)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/evaluation/azure-ai-evaluation).\n- GitHub Models: Quickly try GPT-5 family variants (gpt-5, mini, nano, chat) in the marketplace and your IDE to test latency and output quality. See\n[Models · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models).\n\nFor .NET apps, when you evaluate or switch to GPT-5, keep quality checks consistent across unit tests and CI by using Microsoft.Extensions.AI Evaluation. It provides quality, safety, and NLP evaluators with caching and reporting to help you spot regressions before rollout. See [The Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation libraries (Learn)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/conceptual/evaluation-libraries) and the blog [Exploring Agent Quality and NLP evaluators](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/exploring-agent-quality-and-nlp-evaluators/).\n\n**Tip**\n\nPrefer structured outputs for easier, automated checks (schema validation), and evaluate with groundedness and relevance metrics on your own datasets before switching defaults.\n\n## What we’ve been building\n\nWe’ve been experimenting with GPT-5 across Microsoft and the open-source community. Here are two highlights from the past week:\n\n### Pamela Fox — Evaluating GPT-5 for RAG\n\n- Blog: [GPT-5: Will it RAG?](https://blog.pamelafox.org/2025/08/gpt-5-will-it-rag.html)\n- A deep dive into evaluation setup and early takeaways for GPT-5 on retrieval-augmented generation.\n\n### Anthony Shaw — GitHub Models CLI updates\n\n- Repo: [tonybaloney/llm-github-models](https://github.com/tonybaloney/llm-github-models)\n- Updated to work with the GPT-5 family via GitHub Models, making it easy to test prompts and workflows from the command line.\n\nTony also wrote up a big blog post on [Using an LLM in GitHub Actions](https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/using-llm-in-github-actions.html). He explores how to integrate a large language model directly into GitHub Actions workflows, enabling automated reasoning, code review, and decision-making within CI pipelines. He walks through setting up a custom action that invokes an LLM via API, discusses practical use cases like summarizing PRs or validating commit messages, and highlights the potential for AI-assisted automation in developer tooling. It’s a hands-on look at bringing GPT-powered intelligence into everyday DevOps.\n\n### Burke Holland — Vibe coding with GPT-5 in VS Code\n\nBurke tries some “vibe coding” with GPT-5 in Visual Studio Code—he has GPT-5 build a working website while he goes to eat dinner, and it does a pretty good job. The design looks pretty nice, too. [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqc85X2rpEY)\n\nBurke also tried an experiment where he asked GPT-5 to create an “aesthetically pleasing game” three times, with [three different results](https://polite-sea-05be72110.2.azurestaticapps.net/).\n\n## Quick reference table\n\n| Product / Service | GPT-5 Integration Highlights | Announcement / Documentation | | --- | --- | --- | | 💻 Visual Studio Code | GPT-5 via AI Toolkit; supports GPT OSS and cloud/local development. | [GPT-5 Family of Models & GPT OSS Are Now Available in AI Toolkit for VS Code](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredevcommunityblog/gpt-5-family-of-models--gpt-oss-are-now-available-in-ai-toolkit-for-vs-code/4441394) • [GitHub Copilot in VS Code – July release (v1.103)](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-07-github-copilot-in-vs-code-july-release-v1-103/) • [GPT-5 mini](https://aka.ms/vscode-github-changelog-gpt5-mini) | | 🤖 GitHub Copilot | Enhanced coding with GPT-5 for longer and more complex tasks; integrated into VS Code and GitHub. | [GitHub Copilot in VS Code – July release (v1.103)](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-07-github-copilot-in-vs-code-july-release-v1-103/) • [OpenAI GPT-5 is now available in public preview in Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-12-openai-gpt-5-is-now-available-in-public-preview-in-visual-studio-jetbrains-ides-xcode-and-eclipse) • [GPT-5 mini in Copilot for VS Code](https://aka.ms/vscode-github-changelog-gpt5-mini) | | ☁️ Azure AI Foundry | Enterprise-grade GPT-5 with security, model routing, and structured outputs. | [Azure OpenAI models: GPT-5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models#gpt-5) • [Registration for gpt-5 access](https://aka.ms/oai/gpt5access) • [Reasoning models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/reasoning) | | 🧬 GitHub Models | gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-chat. | [Models · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/models) | | 🛠️ Microsoft Copilot Studio | Makers can select GPT-5 models for agent orchestration; GPT-5 Chat and Reasoning with auto-routing. | [Available today: GPT-5 in Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-copilot-studio/) | | 📄 Microsoft 365 Copilot | GPT-5 powers Copilot Chat with smarter orchestration, improved reasoning, and multimodal capabilities.
