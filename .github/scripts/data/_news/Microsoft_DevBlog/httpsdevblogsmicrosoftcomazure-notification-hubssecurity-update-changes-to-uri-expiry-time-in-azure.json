Starting from October 2024, the expiry time of **PnsErrorDetailsUri** will be reduced from 10 days to 5 days. This means that the **PnsErrorDetailsUri** returned will now be valid for only 5 days and will expire thereafter.\n\nThe **PnsErrorDetailsUri** is returned from the Get Notification Message Telemetry API, which provides additional telemetry on the finished states of outgoing push notifications. Learn more about Get Notification Message Telemetry API [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/notificationhubs/get-notification-message-telemetry).\n\nConsumers of this API are requested to take note of this change and make the necessary adjustments for backward compatibility.\n\nPlease note that for the Get Platform Notification Services (PNS) Feedback API, the container URI returned will continue to have an expiry time of 1 day, as before.\n\nThank you for choosing Azure Notification Hubs for your push notification needs.
