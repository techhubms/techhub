We invite you to join [our May release discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/discussions/5160).\n\nThis release has new [azd compose](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-compose) features, a few bug fixes, and a batch of new templates, so let’s get into it. Here’s what’s new with `azd` with the May release:\n\n## New features\n\n- [\\[5073\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5073) **Support for generating CI definition for alpha feature composability mode**. This enhancement allows you to automatically create GitHub Actions workflows for your composed applications. When using `azd`\nin the alpha feature composability mode, you can now generate CI/CD pipelines that understand the relationships between your services and deploy them in the correct order. Try it with `azd pipeline config` in your composed project.\n- [\\[5077\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5077) **`azd add` support for Azure App Service (Node and Python)**. You can now add Node.js and Python applications to your project and deploy them to Azure App Service using the `azd add`\ncommand. This feature complements the existing support for containerized applications and provides more flexibility for your hosting options.\n\n## Other changes\n\n- [\\[4885\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/4885) Pack build to support multi-module projects.
