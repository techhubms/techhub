By default, ChatGPT 4 is selected, but you can easily switch to Claude 3.7 Sonnet to harness its advanced features.\n\nIf you don’t see Claude 3.7 as an option, there could be two reasons:\n\n1. **It’s not available for Copilot Free users.** Only paid Copilot users have access to this model.\n2. **You need to enable the policy for 3.7 Sonnet in your GitHub profile.** Make sure to enable Claude access in your [setting](https://github.com/settings/copilot).\n\n#### Learn More\n\nFor further details, check out the [Using Claude Sonnet in Copilot Chat – GitHub Docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/using-claude-sonnet-in-github-copilot#about-claude-sonnet-in-github-copilot-chat)\n\nWe’re super excited about this enhancement to our development environment and can’t wait to hear your feedback.
