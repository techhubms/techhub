In reality, coding activities are more diverse than writing new code. What if Copilot could better assist your coding not only with code generation, but your code editing activities as well?\n\nWe are excited to announce *next edit suggestions,* or *NES* for short, is now available in **Visual Studio 2022 17.14** to further improve your coding experience. NES leverages the previous edits made and predicts the next edit to come, whether it’s an insertion, deletion, or mix of both. Unlike Copilot completions which are limited to generating suggestions at your caret location, NES can support you anywhere in your file, where the next edit is most likely to occur.\n\n## Example usage scenarios\n\nNext edit suggestions can be helpful in a variety of scenarios, not only making obvious repetitive changes like renaming, but also more logical changes when you are adding/removing variables or changing the intention of a method. Here are some examples:\n\n#### **1. Refactoring a 2D Point class to 3D Point:**\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Point3-26-1.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Point3-26-1.mp4)\n\n#### **2. Update the code syntax to modern C++ using STL:**\n\nNote that NES is not just making repetitive changes to updating all “printf() “ to “std::cout“, but also updating other syntax such as “fgets()“.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Migration3-28-1.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Migration3-28-1.mp4)\n\n#### **3. Make logical changes in response to a newly added variable:**\n\nNES responds quickly to the new variable, which adds the maximum number of guesses a player can make in a game, and Copilot Completions also jumps in to help.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/AddingVariable3-28.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/AddingVariable3-28.mp4)\n\n##\n\n## Getting started with next edit suggestions\n\nEnable NES via **Tools &gt; Options &gt; GitHub &gt; Copilot &gt; Copilot Completions &gt; Enable Next Edit Suggestions.**\n\nLike completions, all you need to do to get NES is to start coding!\n\nWhen there is an available edit suggestion, it could be presented in a diff view where the red diff indicates the original code you had, and the green indicates the new one suggested by Copilot to clearly shows any replacement or deletion of your original code.\n\nIf the edit is on a different line than the one you are on now, it will suggest you **Tab** to Navigate to the corresponding line first. The arrow in the hint bar indicates where the next edit is located. You won’t need to manually search for related edits anymore; NES will lead the way!\n\n![Next edit suggestions pop up with a navigation hint bar that includes Tab and arrow key down, a purple arrow in the gutter space next to the line number, and inline diffs where red indicates the original code and green indicates the new code. The current caret location is on line 1 and the edit is on line 4, thus the navigation hint bar is suggesting the user to hit tab to jump from line 1 to line 4.](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAoEAAAE2AQMAAAAkutqrAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAMElEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQ0PoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAODDAGNMAAHkR73tAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\n\nAfter you are on the same line as the edit, you can **Tab to Accept** the suggestion.\n\n![Next edit suggestions, still with inline diffs where red indicates the original code and green indicates the new code. Now the caret location is on line 4, where is the part of the suggestion area, so the gutter arrow changes from purple to grey, and the navigation hint bar changes to say Tab accept.](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAArgAAAERAQMAAACq9UbXAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAALklEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlT3+AEVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA8Axd2AABwLi9LQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nIn addition to the hint bars, an arrow in the gutter also pops up to indicate that there is an edit suggestion available. You can click on the arrow to explore the edit suggestion menu. This menu allows you to interact with NES using a mouse, when you don’t want to press the Tab key.\n\n![Next edit suggestions, still with inline diffs where red indicates the original code and green indicates the new code. The view where user clicks on the gutter arrow, and a context menu pops up below the gutter arrow with three options: Navigate to, Accept, Dismiss](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAqMAAADIAQMAAADm/XqbAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAKElEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ43oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADgxwBDMAABPf3+DAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nSee next edit suggestions explained step-by-step:\n\nPlease give NES a try today to let it assist you in your logical editing flow!
