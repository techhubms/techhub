This new feature aims to streamline your documentation process and enhance your coding experience.\n\nTo access these updates, you will need a GitHub Copilot subscription. If you don’t already have GitHub Copilot, you can sign up for free [here](https://github.com/settings/copilot).\n\n# AI doc comment generation\n\nIf you have automatic doc comment generation enabled via your settings, you can simply type what would trigger your doc comment format (such as ///) and Copilot suggestions will automatically fill out the function description based on the contents of the function, including a summary and any parameters and return types (if available). You can then accept these suggestions using a single tab, just like regular Copilot code completions.\n\n# ![Gif showcasing copilot generating a summary in the comments](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAwAAAAEnAQMAAAAkebZqAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAMklEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwI0Bb8cAAVAQnJ8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=)\n\n# How to enable doc comments\n\nTo access this feature, you will need to have automatically generating doc comments enabled.\n\nFor C++ projects, you can configure the generated documentation comment styles using the following setting in **Tools &gt; Options.** Both XML and Doxygen style comments are supported by this feature.\n\n![Tools &gt; Option, Coding Style, General to enable for C++](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA2cAAAJJAQMAAAAUVN3UAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAVUlEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQsvoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+Bn7XgABUZXTQAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nFor C#, you would need to enable the following setting in your **Tools &gt; Options**\n\n![Tools &gt; Option, C#, Advanced, Comments for C#](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAzEAAAInAQMAAACSoEXxAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAATklEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlTn+AGVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAN9/YAAFhJtQ3AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nThis feature is available for Visual Studio 17.14 Preview 2 for both C# and C++ project files.
