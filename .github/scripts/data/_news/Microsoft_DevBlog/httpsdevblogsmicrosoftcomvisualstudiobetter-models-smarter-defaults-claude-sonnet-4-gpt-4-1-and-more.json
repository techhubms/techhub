  "EnhancedContent": "Weâ€™re excited to share some major improvements to the Copilot experience in Visual Studio, including smarter default models, more choices, and easier ways to manage your usage.\n\n### **Smarter default model**\n\nCopilot in Visual Studio now uses **GPT-4.1** as the default model (previously 4o). In our testing, it delivers significantly better performanceâ€”faster responses, higher quality suggestions, and greater efficiency overall.\n\n### **More models to choose from**\n\nWant to try something else? You now have access to an ever-broader range of models:\n\n- **Claude Sonnet 4**\n- **Claude Opus 4**\n- **Claude Sonnet 3.5**\n- **Claude 3.7 (non-thinking and thinking)**\n- **OpenAI o3 mini**\n- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**\n- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**\n\nModel selections are now sticky, meaning your chosen model stays selected across threads for a smoother workflow. Not sure which model to use for your task? Check out [this documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/using-github-copilot/ai-models/choosing-the-right-ai-model-for-your-task) to learn about each modelsâ€™ strengths. Give them a try and let us know what you think!\n\nWeâ€™ve also made it easier to enable and switch between models. If a model is available under your plan but not yet enabled, youâ€™ll now see a prompt right in the model pickerâ€”no need to navigate to GitHub settings.\n\n[![inline approval image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABG4AAAKQAQMAAAD0S656AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAcklEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQ0PoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBXA25/AAEwzbHrAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/inline-approval.png)\n\n### **Usage management and billing updates**\n\nWith GitHubâ€™s [new billing model](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-18-update-to-github-copilot-consumptive-billing-experience/), weâ€™ve made a few updates in Visual Studio to help you stay in control.\n\n## Track Your Usage Easily\n\nWeâ€™ve added a new **Copilot Consumptions** panel to help you monitor your usage. Just click the Copilot badge in the top-right corner of Visual Studio, then select **Copilot Consumptions** to see how many premium requests youâ€™ve used across chat, inline suggestions, and more.\n\n[![usage image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAxMAAAHDAQMAAABlNdUVAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAQklEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8GbAsAAEdp1xHAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/usage.png)\n\nFrom there, you can also access **Manage Plan** to update your subscription or adjust settings on GitHub.com. If you run out of your [premium requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/monitoring-usage-and-entitlements/about-premium-requests), youâ€™ll automatically switch to a standard model, GPT-4.1, at no extra cost.\n\n**Note:** Some models may count more heavily toward your quotaâ€”for example, number of requests consumed vary depending on the model used. Youâ€™ll see this clearly indicated in the model picker before you make a selection.\n\nWe hope these updates make Copilot in Visual Studio more powerful and transparent for you. Have a favorite model? Tell us how youâ€™re using itâ€”weâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸ˜Š\n\n## Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place! Visit the [Visual Studio Hub](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/hub/) for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions.\n\n## We appreciate your feedback\n\nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers.
