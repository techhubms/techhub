Visual Studio 2022 introduces the capability to adapt your pasted code with Copilot to reduce the time you spend on making tedious changes.\n\n# Streamline manual code modifications with adaptive paste\n\nWhen you’re copying and pasting code, the process often comes with extra steps. Adjusting parameters, correcting styling, or fixing even the most minor errors can slow down your workflow. These small, repetitive tasks add up and disrupt your focus. Addressing these challenges, Visual Studio introduces a new Copilot-powered capability that adapts pasted code seamlessly, saving you time and effort.\n\nThis feature intelligently adapts pasted code to your solution’s context, incorporating the new code into your existing project by:\n\n- Aligning syntax and styling with the document\n- Inferring parameter adjustments\n- Fixing minor errors\n- Supporting language translation, human and code-based\n- Completing patterns or filling in blanks\n\n## Example: Implementing interface members\n\nImagine you’re working with a `Math` class that implements the `IMath` interface. You copy and paste the implementation for the `Ceiling` method into the same file. Adapting the pasted code will adjust the code to implement the missing `Floor` method, completing the interface for you.\n\n![Adaptive paste example gif](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABh8AAALBAQMAAAByfiJPAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAnUlEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQlPoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4GweowABFlhAKAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\n## How to use it\n\nThe adaptive paste springs into action the moment you perform a regular paste using `Ctrl+V`, assuming the pasted code has at least three lines. When the “Tab to adapt” suggestion action appears, you can press the `TAB` key to request a suggestion. You’ll then see a diff that compares the original pasted code with the adjusted version, so you can preview changes before they’re applied.\n\n# Try adaptive paste in Version 17.14 Preview 3\n\nStarting in [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14 Preview 3](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/) and in the stable 17.14 version release, you can try adaptive paste by turning on the option:\n\n**Tools &gt; Options &gt; GitHub &gt; Copilot &gt; Editor &gt; Enable Adaptive Paste.**\n\nOnce activated, adaptive paste becomes a helpful tool in your workflow. Whether you’re integrating new snippets, fixing small errors, or streamlining patterns, it supports you in coding more efficiently.\n\n# Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!
