  "EnhancedContent": "Thank you for your interest in the new Azure SDKs! We release new features, improvements, and bug fixes every month. Subscribe to our [Azure SDK Blog RSS Feed](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/feed/) to get notified when a new release is available.\n\nYou can find links to packages, code, and docs on our [Azure SDK Releases page](https://aka.ms/azsdk/releases).\n\n## Give feedback\n\nIf youâ€™ve been using the Azure SDK, weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! Take a moment to [complete the survey](https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog-survey)!\n\n## Release highlights\n\n### ðŸš€ Beta Launch: Azure SDK for Rust ðŸ¦€\n\nWeâ€™re thrilled to announce the first beta releases for the official Azure SDK for Rust, which include libraries for Identity, Key Vault secrets & keys, Event Hubs, and Cosmos DB. These libraries are designed to provide a seamless and idiomatic experience for Rust developers working with Azure services. Rust is known for its performance, reliability, and memory safety, making it an excellent choice for systems programming and applications that require high performance and low-level control. By providing an official Azure SDK for Rust, we aim to empower Rust developers to build robust and efficient applications with Azure, using the full potential of the Rust language. Our team is committed to expanding the Azure SDK for Rust by adding more Azure service libraries and refining these announced libraries. Check out our full [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/rust-in-time-announcing-the-azure-sdk-for-rust-beta/) announcing the new beta.\n\nWe value your feedback and would love to hear about your experiences with the Azure SDK for Rust. Head over to our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues) to share your thoughts, report any issues, and contribute to the project. We canâ€™t wait to hear from you and see what amazing things you build with Rust and Azure! ðŸš€\n\n### Node.js 18 end of life\n\nAccording to the official Node.js [release timeline](https://nodejs.org/about/previous-releases), Node.js 18 will reach its official end-of-life on April 30, 2025 and will no longer receive security updates and critical bug fixes. We strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version to ensure continued support.\n\nAs a reminder, the Azure SDK libraries arenâ€™t guaranteed to work on platforms and with other dependencies that are deemed end of life. Dropping support for such dependencies may be done without increasing the major version of the Azure SDK libraries. We strongly recommend migration to supported platforms and other dependencies to be eligible for technical support.\n\n### Conda releases\n\nNew Python (Conda) packages are available in the [Microsoft channel](https://anaconda.org/microsoft).\n\n### Initial stable releases\n\n- **Client Library for Java**\n- OpenTelemetry AutoConfigure\n- Device Registry\n- **Management Library for .NET**\n- Device Registry\n- **Management Library for Go**\n- Device Registry\n- **Management Library for JavaScript**\n- Device Registry\n\n### Initial Beta releases\n\n- **Client Library for .NET**\n- Language Conversation Authoring\n- Language Text Authoring\n- **Client Library for Java**\n- System Events\n- **Client Library for Rust**\n- [Identity](https://crates.io/crates/azure_identity)\n- [Key Vault Secrets](https://crates.io/crates/azure_security_keyvault_secrets)\n- [Key Vault Keys](https://crates.io/crates/azure_security_keyvault_keys)\n- [Event Hubs](https://crates.io/crates/azure_messaging_eventhubs)\n- [Cosmos DB](https://crates.io/crates/azure_data_cosmos)\n- **Management Library for Go**\n- Database Watcher\n- Impact Reporting\n- Migration Assistant\n- **Management Library for Java**\n- Database Watcher\n- Impact Reporting\n- Migration Assistant\n- **Management Library for JavaScript**\n- Database Watcher\n- Impact Reporting\n- **Management Library for Python**\n- Database Watcher\n- Impact Reporting\n- Migration Assessment\n- Timezone\n\n## Release notes\n\n- [All languages](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/index.html)\n- [.NET](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/dotnet.html)\n- [Java](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/java.html)\n- [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/js.html)\n- [Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/python.html)\n- [Go](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/go.html)\n- [Rust](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/rust.html)\n- [C++](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/cpp.html)\n- [Embedded C](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/c.html)\n- [Android](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/android.html)\n- [iOS](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/2025-03/ios.html)",
