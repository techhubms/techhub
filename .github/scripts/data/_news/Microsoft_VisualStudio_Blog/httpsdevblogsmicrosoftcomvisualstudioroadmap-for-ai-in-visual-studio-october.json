With every month, we aim to deliver smarter, faster, and more intuitive tools that enhance your coding experience.\n\n*Disclaimer: The items outlined here represent ongoing work for the month. They are not commitments or guarantees for delivery within the current month. U*pvote the features you or your organization care about most, so we know what to prioritize. With that said, here is what we are working on!\n\n### **Remote agents**\n\nWe are starting to bring remote agents like the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent into the platform as a native experience, and this is just the beginning.\n\n- [Start a GitHub Copilot coding agent session from Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Start-a-GitHub-Copilot-coding-agent-sess/10975250?q=coding+agent+)\n\n### **New Agents**\n\nWeâ€™re streamlining how you find and switch between modes and making sure both built-in and extension-provided modes can handle more complex workflows. New agents are in progress:\n\n- [Debugger agent](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-Debugging--Agent-in-Visual-Studi/10951168?)\n- [Modernize Agent Improvements](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Modernize-Agent-Improvements/10975284)\n\n### **Agent Mode/Chat:** ****\n\nWeâ€™ve been listening to your feedback on Agent Mode and Chat, and weâ€™re making some big improvements.\n\nTool call improvements\n\n- [Dynamic tool calling in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Dynamic-tool-calling-in-Chat/10975291)\n- [Summarize thread history to continue in thread](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Summarize-thread-history-when-limits-are/10975263)\n- [Redirect Agent Mode Mid Response](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Redirect-Agent-Mode-Mid-Response/10956902)\n\nPlanning lead development\n\n- [Planning/To dos in Copilot Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/PlanningTo-dos-in-Copilot-Chat/10951150)\n\n### **Performance**\n\nPerformance and response quality are the biggest themes weâ€™ve heard in feedback. Improving them is our top priority, and hereâ€™s what weâ€™re tackling:\n\n- [Improve startup performance of Copilot Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Improve-startup-performance-of-Copilot-C/10976484)\n- [Token Optimization (Reducing token utilization, prompt caching)](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Token-Optimization-Reducing-token-utili/10976486)\n- [Tune code_search to ensure optimized calling](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Tune-code_search-to-ensure-optimized-cal/10976487)\n\n### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**\n\nWe want you to bring your entire development stack into Visual Studio, backed by the same security, governance, and trust you already expect from our product. This sprint, weâ€™re focused on reaching MCP full spec, improving UX and enhancing your governance controls.\n\n- [MCP Elicitation Support](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/MCP-Elicitation-Support-in-Chat/10975264)\n- [MCP Governance â€“ Group Policy](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-enables-governance-to-supp/10951779)\n- [MCP Unified UX Experience](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/MCP-Unified-UX-Experience/10975289)\n- [Windows MCP registry support](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Windows-MCP-registry-support/10976489)\n\n### **Models**\n\nWeâ€™re committed to giving you access to the latest models, and in Visual Studio we carefully evaluate them to make sure you get the best possible experience. We are continuing to expand even further.\n\n- [Auto model in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Auto-model-for-Copilot-Chat/10975254)\n- [Claude Sonnet 4.5 in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Add-Claude-Sonnet-45-Integration-for-Vi/10974906?dialog=comment)\n- [GPT 5 Codex in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Add-GPT-5-Codex-in-Copilot-Chat/10975261)\n\nTo make Visual Studio a truly AI-integrated IDE, we want to ensure that Copilot is seamlessly available at every step of your development workflowâ€”not just for writing code, but also for searching, fixing errors, writing unit tests, and even committing and pushing your changes.\n\nWeâ€™re excited for you to try these new experiences soon. If you have feedback, post it in the developer community ticket linked above. For other ideas or suggestions, drop a comment below or create a new ticketâ€”our team reviews them all.\n\nThanks ðŸ˜Š",
