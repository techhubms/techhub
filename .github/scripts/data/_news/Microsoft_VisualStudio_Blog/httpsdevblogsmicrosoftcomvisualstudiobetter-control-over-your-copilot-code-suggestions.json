  "EnhancedContent": "Copilot code completions and suggestions in the editor speed you up in your daily programming and coding activities, at every keystroke. They help you finish the line you’re typing or anticipate your next edit, making your workflow smoother and faster. At the same time, editor is where you focus and put in the deep work. Based on your feedback, we understand how important it is to strike the right balance between helpful suggestions and maintaining control over your attention and workspace.\n\nWe’re excited to share features that give you enhanced control over your Copilot experience, so you can decide when suggestions show up and how much you accept, right inside your editor. These features are all available to you now, starting Visual Studio 2022 17.14.13 (August 2025).\n\n## Minimize Distractions When Coding\n\nDo you prefer a quieter editor when actively thinking and coding? We have a few options in Visual Studio to help you stay focused on programming and still have Copilot assistance available for you when you are ready to review them.\n\n### 1. No completions while typing\n\nBy default, completion is requested at every keystroke you type to provide just-in-time support. We learned from you that it could show up too quickly sometimes and interfere with your typing. You can pause code completions when you are quickly typing out the code. Go to **Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; IntelliCode -&gt; Advanced** and turn on **wait for pauses in typing before showing whole line completions*.*** This will add a debounce to request code completions when you are typing, so you will not see the completions quickly showing and disappearing while you are typing fast.\n\n### 2. Only receive code completions when you request it\n\nYou can now disable automatic completions popping on and trigger them manually with keyboard shortcuts. This gives you full control over when suggestions appear, helping you stay focused when you need to and get help when you want it.\n\nConfigure the trigger for code completions in **Tools &gt; Options &gt; IntelliCode &gt; General**. The default experience is **Automatically generate code completions in the Editor** and you can uncheck this setting to only receive suggestions when you explicitly request them by pressing `Alt`\n+ `,`\nor `Alt`\n+ `.`\n. If there are multiple code suggestions available after requesting, you can cycle through them by pressing `Alt`\n+ `,`\nor `Alt`\n+ `.`\nas well.\n\nWhen triggered with the keyboard shortcuts, a thinking hint bar will appear at your cursor position to indicate that Copilot is generating code suggestions. If no suggestions are returned, the hint bar will disappear after a few seconds. If suggestions are available, you can accept them by pressing Tab.\n\n### 3. Hide next edit suggestions and review them when you are ready\n\n[Next edit suggestions](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/next-edit-suggestions-available-in-visual-studio-github-copilot/) predict the next edit you will make based on your previous code edits. Sometimes these suggestions can be a bit distracting when appearing unexpectedly, and now you can hide NES by default and only review them when you want to.\n\nNES will still be triggered based on your edits and when there is an available NES ready for you to review, a **margin indicator** will appear in the gutter space, pointing at the line that it has a suggestion for. To view this suggestion, you can either:\n\n1. Click the margin indicator or\n2. Press `Tab`\n\nand the suggestion will be displayed. Then, after viewing the suggestions, you can press Tab again to accept it or press ESC to dismiss it. After you accept a suggestion, any related suggestions will automatically appear again, as you might find them useful too. Any other new suggestions that are not related to your previously accepted suggestion will be hidden again.\n\nFor example, in the video below, after changing Point to Point3D, a NES is available but not displayed directly. The margin indicator and hint bar show that there is a suggestion on line 4 and then I clicked on the indicator to review it.\n\n[video mp4=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/NEScollapsemode.mp4\"][https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/completions-on-demand.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/completions-on-demand.mp4)\n\n### 3. Hide next edit suggestions and only preview when you are ready\n\n[Next edit suggestions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/copilot-next-edit-suggestions?view=vs-2022) predict the next edit you will make based on your previous code edits. Sometimes these suggestions can be a bit distracting when appearing unexpectedly, and now you can hide NES by default and only review them when you want to.\n\nNES will still be triggered based on your edits and when there is an available NES ready for you to review, a **margin indicator** will appear in the gutter space, pointing at the line that it has a suggestion for.

We are excited to announce that you will now be able to partially accept a code completion word by word or line by line!\n\nWhen having a Copilot code completion in the editor…\n\n- Use the shortcut `Ctrl`\n+ `Right Arrow`\nto accept one **word** at a time,\n- Use the shortcut `Ctrl`\n+ `Down Arrow`\nto accept one **line** at a time.\n\nYou can also use the margin indicator to accept the completion partially. When clicking on the margin indicator, it will have options for partial accepts too.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/partial-accept.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/partial-accept.mp4)\n\nNow you will have more fine-grained control over how much code completions you would like to accept instead of having to accept the entire suggestions and edit afterwards. Please try it out and let us know what you think!\n\nNote: Partial accept overrides the existing functionality that bind to these shortcuts. If you would like to turn it off, please go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; IntelliCode &gt; Advanced &gt; Whole-line completions\n\n## Thanks for sharing your feedback!\n\nWe worked on these improvements because of your valuable feedback shared with us through Developer Community ([Copilot completions are too intrusive – Developer Community,](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-completions-are-too-intrusive/10810929#T-ND10921637) [Ability to partially accept GitHub Copilot suggestions – Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Ability-to-partially-accept-GitHub-Copil/10906088?q=partial+accept)) and product surveys. We truly appreciate your input—it helps us build better experiences. Please try out these ways to fine-tune Copilot suggestions in your editor and let us know how we can keep making it better for you!\n\n### Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!
