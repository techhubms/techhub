This change streamlines the UI development workflow for .NET MAUI applications.\n\n## Design-Time Availability\n\nPreviously, XAML Live Preview was only accessible while debugging. With this release, you can open the XAML Live Preview window directly during design time. This allows you to see changes in your app UI in real-time. You can also use Hot Reload and other live UI tools in this way, ensuring a seamless workflow, improving iteration speed, and reducing context switching.\n\nTo open it, go to **Debug** &gt; **Windows** &gt; **XAML Live Preview**.\n\nThe XAML Live Preview window supports:\n\n- **Element selection** for navigating to source XAML.\n- **Zoom and ruler tools** for layout inspection.\n- **Docking** within the IDE for persistent visibility.\n\n## .NET MAUI Support for Android Targets\n\nIn addition to Windows, XAML Live Preview also supports rendering of **Android devices and emulators**. This allows developers to validate UI changes across platforms, providing a high-fidelity design-time experience that ensures consistency across devices.\n\n## GitHub Copilot and Vision Support\n\nTake your UI design to the next level with XAML Live Preview and **GitHub Copilot**, supporting both manual and AI-assisted XAML authoring. With **Copilot Vision**, you can attach a reference image of a desired UI layout, and Copilot will generate the corresponding XAML. Live Preview reflects these changes in real time, enabling rapid prototyping and refinement.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/25166_MauiAgentVS2026_v2.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/25166_MauiAgentVS2026_v2.mp4)\n\n## Availability and Getting Started\n\nThis feature is available in:\n\n- **Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14**\n- **Visual Studio 2026 Insiders release**\n\nTo begin using XAML Live Preview and explore its capabilities, refer to the official [XAML Live Preview Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/xaml-tools/xaml-live-preview).",
