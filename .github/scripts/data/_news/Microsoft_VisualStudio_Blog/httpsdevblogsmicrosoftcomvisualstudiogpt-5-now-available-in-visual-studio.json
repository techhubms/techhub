This release brings a new level of capability to your development workflow, making it easier to move from idea to implementation.\n\n**Try it now:** Click the Copilot badge in your IDE, open Chat, and select GPT-5 (Preview).\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/gpt5new-3.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/gpt5new-3.mp4)\n\n### Why GPT-5 Matters to you\n\nGPT-5 is OpenAI’s most advanced model to date. It delivers substantial improvements in:\n\n- Reasoning and decision-making for complex coding tasks\n- Code quality and maintainability, even for large implementations with minimal prompting\n- Clarity of explanations, giving you a better understanding of the changes it makes\n\nFrom building end-to-end features to understanding unfamiliar codebases, GPT-5 is designed to help you move faster while staying in control.\n\n### Availability\n\nGPT-5 is rolling out to all paid Copilot plans starting today. You can access it in both Agent Mode and Ask Mode. If you do not yet see GPT-5 in your model picker, check back soon as rollout continues. Note: As GPT‑5 becomes more widely available, GitHub has announced the phased deprecation of several older models, see: [Upcoming deprecation of o1, GPT-4.5, o3-mini, and GPT-4o – GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-20-upcoming-deprecation-of-o1-gpt-4-5-o3-mini-and-gpt-4o/).\n\n**For Copilot Enterprise and Business customers:** Administrators must enable the GPT-5 policy in Copilot settings. Once enabled, users in the organization will be able to select GPT-5 in the model picker in Visual Studio.",
