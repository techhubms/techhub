With every month, we aim to deliver smarter, faster, and more intuitive tools that enhance your coding experience.\n\n*Disclaimer: The items outlined here represent ongoing work for the month. They are not commitments or guarantees for delivery within the current month. U*pvote the features you or your organization care about most, so we know what to prioritize. With that said, here is what we are working on!\n\n### **New Agents**\n\nWe’re streamlining how you find and switch between modes and making sure both built-in and extension-provided agents can handle more complex workflows. New agents are in progress:\n\n- [User Created custom agents](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Custom-modes-for-Copilot-Chat/10950930?q=custom+modes)\n- [Test Agent](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-Test-Agent-in-Visual-Studio/10977071)\n- [Debugger agent](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-Debugging--Agent-in-Visual-Studi/10951168?)\n\nWe are even working on supporting multiple agents at once\n\n- [Investigate being able to run multiple VS Agents concurrently](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Investigate-being-able-to-run-multiple-V/10992995)\n\n### **Agent Mode/Chat:**\n\nWe’ve been listening to your feedback on Agent Mode and Chat, and we’re making some big improvements.\n\n- [Slash Commands – Invoke Prompts and Manage Chats](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Slash-Commands-%E2%80%94-Unified-and-Extensible/10992996)\n- [Memories Improvements in Chat – Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Memories-Improvements-in-Chat/10993002)\n\nTool call improvements\n\n- - [Dynamic tool calling in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Dynamic-tool-calling-in-Chat/10975291)\n- [Summarize thread history to continue in thread](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Summarize-thread-history-when-limits-are/10975263)\n\nPlanning lead development\n\n- [Make Planning in Chat, Read-Only](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Make-Planning-in-Chat-Read-Only/10993007)\n- [Improve Planning UX, Inline Preview in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Improve-Planning-UX-Inline-Preview-in-C/10993009)\n\n### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**\n\nWe want you to bring your entire development stack into Visual Studio, backed by the same security, governance, and trust you already expect from our product. This sprint, we’re focused on reaching MCP full spec, improving UX and enhancing your governance controls.\n\n- [Improve MCP Sampling Window UX](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Move-MCP-Sampling-Window-to-In-chat-expe/10993000)\n- [Performance and token usage optimizations for MCP servers](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Performance-and-token-usage-optimization/10993001)\n- [Visual Studio enables governance for MCP servers](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-enables-governance-to-supp/10951779?sort=relevance&amp;scope=follow)\n- [MCP Unified UX Experience](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/MCP-Unified-UX-Experience/10975289?sort=relevance&amp;scope=follow)\n\n### **Models**\n\nWe’re committed to giving you access to the latest models, and in Visual Studio we carefully evaluate them to make sure you get the best possible experience. We are continuing to expand even further.\n\n- [Auto model in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Auto-model-for-Copilot-Chat/10975254)\n- [GPT 5 Codex in Chat](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Add-GPT-5-Codex-in-Copilot-Chat/10975261)\n- [Improve Model UX for Soon to be Deprecated Models](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Improve-Model-UX-for-Soon-to-be-Deprecat/10992997)\n- [Different System prompts per model](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Different-System-prompts-per-model/10992999)\n\nTo make Visual Studio a truly AI-integrated IDE, we want to ensure that Copilot is seamlessly available at every step of your development workflow—not just for writing code, but also for searching, fixing errors, writing unit tests, and even committing and pushing your changes.\n\nWe’re excited for you to try these new experiences soon. If you have feedback, post it in the developer community ticket linked above. For other ideas or suggestions, drop a comment below or create a new ticket—our team reviews them all.\n\nThanks 😊"
