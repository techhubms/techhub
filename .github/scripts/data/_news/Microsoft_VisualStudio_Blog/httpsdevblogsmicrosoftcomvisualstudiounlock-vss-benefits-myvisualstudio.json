Redmond, right here on the Microsoft campus in Building 33, about to reveal what I call the hidden value of a Visual Studio subscription. I pull up a simple question on the screen:*\n\n[![Picture of My.VisualStudio.com Portal Question](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJAAQMAAAApW4aWAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAXklEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7wYiTwAB/qbe0QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://aka.ms/myvs)\n\nAbout half the hands go up in the packed Kodiak Auditorium. Good start.\n\n“Now, how many have actually logged in and activated your benefits?”\n\nThe room goes quiet. Maybe 160 hands remain raised.\n\n“And how many are using your monthly Azure credits?”\n\nI watch as the forest of hands dwindles to just a couple dozen brave souls. The math is staggering, and I see it everywhere I go. Visual Studio subscribers are essentially leaving money on the table.\n\n**The Moment Everything Clicks**\n\nWhat happens next never gets old. I navigate to [my.visualstudio.com](https://aka.ms/myvs) live on stage, and I watch faces light up across all 400+ seats as we explore together. There’s always that one developer in the third row who suddenly sits up straighter when they realize their Professional subscription includes $50 monthly in Azure credits. Or the enterprise developer in the back who does quick math and realizes she’s been missing out on $1,800 worth of annual Azure credits.\n\n[![MSDN image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAoQAAAHNAQMAAAC9xvg1AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAPElEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQ0PoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAODBAJOqAAG6qc05AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/MSDN.png)\n\nBut the real magic happens when we dive deeper into the Downloads section. This is what used to be called MSDN. The gasps are audible when developers see the treasure trove waiting for them: Windows Server, SQL Server Developer Edition, Office Professional Plus, and dozens of other Microsoft products they could have been using for development and testing all along.\n\n“Wait,” someone always calls out from the 400-person crowd, “I can download all of this? Now?”\n\n*Yes, when you need software for development and testing, this portal will help you find, download and activate it.*\n\n**The Stories That Stick**\n\nAustin, a team lead from Dallas, approached me after a session at our Redmond event. She and her dev team had been eyeing some Pluralsight licenses for months, not realizing their Visual Studio Enterprise subscriptions already included up to 12 months of access for every Visual Studio developer. “We were about to submit a training budget request,” she said, pulling out her phone to message her team. “Turns out we can unlock this right now.”\n\nThen there’s Miguel from Chicago, who discovered the power of [Azure Dev/Test](https://aka.ms/vss-devtest) discounts during our benefits walkthrough. His company was struggling to afford a proper testing environment that mirrored their production setup for integrating a new asset management system with Logic Apps. “I can spin up the exact same environment for 50% less, “He texted his manager right in front of me. ‘Discounted DevTest pricing means we can finally test this integration properly without blowing our budget.'”\n\nThese aren’t isolated stories. At every single [Visual Studio Live!](https://aka.ms/vss-vslive) event (whether it’s our intimate 400-person Microsoft HQ gathering or our larger city events) I hear variations of these revelations. Developers who’ve been subscribers for years, completely unaware of the developer toolkit they’ve been carrying in their back pocket.\n\n**Why This Matters More Than Ever**\n\nIn my focus groups across the country (from our exclusive Microsoft HQ events to cities nationwide) I’ve discovered something interesting: developers who actively use their subscription benefits are 40% more likely to report job satisfaction. They’re learning new skills with Cloud Academy training, building prototypes with Azure credits, and testing enterprise scenarios with software included with the subscription.\n\nOne CTO in Boston told me, “Once our team started actually using their Visual Studio benefits, our innovation velocity doubled. They’re not asking for budget approval to try new technologies. They’re already experimenting and showing me prototypes. We even held our first internal Hackathon.”\n\n**Your Benefits are waiting**\n\n[!\\[vss pro benefits list2 image\\](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJGAQMAAAD/AmWLAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAX0lEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwLsBJVUAAWoYTfAAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/vss-pro-benefits-list2.png)\n\nHere’s the beautiful irony: the portal designed to unlock all these benefits ([my.visualstudio.com](https://aka.ms/myvs)) is itself the best-kept secret. Microsoft created this gateway to developer success, yet most subscribers treat it like a forgotten app on their phone.\n\nThe next time you’re stuck waiting for budget approval to try a new Azure service, remember: you might already have $50 (Professional) or $150 (Enterprise) in monthly Azure credits waiting — every month, with no credit card required. When you need SQL Server for a side project, remember: the Developer Edition is sitting in your Downloads section. When you need to mirror your production environment for testing, remember: DevTest pricing can cut your costs by up to 57%.\n\n**The Five-Minute Challenge**\n\nI’ll leave you with the same challenge I give every audience (all 400+ developers at our Microsoft HQ events and beyond): Set a timer for five minutes right now. Go to [my.visualstudio.com](https://aka.ms/myvs), sign in with your Visual Studio subscription email, and click through every section. Benefits, Downloads, Product Keys. Don’t overthink it, don’t plan what you’ll use. Just see what’s there.\n\nI guarantee you’ll find something that makes you smile. Maybe it’s those Azure credits you forgot about. Maybe it’s a piece of software you were planning to purchase. Maybe it’s access to training from Cloud Academy or Pluralsight that could change your career trajectory.\n\nThe key to your developer toolkit has been in your pocket all along. It’s time to unlock it.\n\n*Ready to unlock what you’ve already paid for? Visit [my.visualstudio.com](https://aka.ms/myvs) today and discover the benefits waiting for you.
