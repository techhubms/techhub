Visual Studio 2026 makes it easier than ever to stay current with the latest productivity features, performance improvements, and security fixes all without disrupting your flow. With the new Visual Studio install experience, you can effortlessly recreate your previous Visual Studio 2022 environment. Your workloads, SDKs, toolsets, extensions and settings are automatically copied and configured, so everything you need to build and continue developing your project is ready the moment you open Visual Studio 2026.\n\nWith support for multiple toolsets and SDK versions, Visual Studio 2026 lets you update the IDE independently from your project dependencies. Keep your environment modern and secure, while maintaining full compatibility with your existing builds.\n\nInstall Visual Studio 2026 from the installer Available tab or download the [bootstrapper.](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)\n\n## The new install experience\n\nThe new Visual Studio Installer is built to make upgrading seamless. It detects your existing Visual Studio 2022 setup and can rebuild it in Visual Studio 2026, including workloads, toolsets, SDKs, extensions, and settings. You’ll spend less time setting up and more time writing code.\n\nIf you’re setting up on a new machine, simply import your **[.vsconfig](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/import-export-installation-configurations?view=visualstudio)**[file](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/import-export-installation-configurations?view=visualstudio) (which captures your favorite workloads, toolsets, SDKs and extensions) and pair it with your [**.vssettings** file](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide?view=visualstudio) to recreate your previous Visual Studio environment exactly the way you like it.\n\n![New install experience, Migration landing page in Installer](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABYIAAAOAAQMAAAC9upVqAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAsUlEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlTX+EAVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAb28eAAG/VW7IAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)\n\n## Setup Assistant (in-IDE dependency acquisition)\n\nWhen you load a project in Visual Studio 2026, the new Setup Assistant automatically detects the dependencies your project targets. With support for multiple toolsets and SDKs, you can quickly **retarget** your project to the latest version, or, if needed, **install** any specific missing dependencies with just a few clicks.\n\n**For C++ developers –** the Setup Assistant identifies MSVC Build Tools and Windows SDKs your project targets. You can **retarget** your project to the latest version or **install** any missing components with a single click directly in the Visual Studio Installer.\n\n![Gif of C++ Setup Assistant experience](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAHCAQMAAAAtrT+LAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAQ0lEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlTX+EAVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAvAaxigABBuORigAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nFor more details check out the C++ blog post: [Blog Post – Upgrading Your Projects.docx](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/DD_VC/ERKhD-q_gY1Mp6SmFTcAmCUBf76Obj56NJaItVF3b_jmzw?CID=479d20fe-f7c5-0de5-d470-c7ef8e2f580f&amp;clickParams=eyJYLUFwcE5hbWUiOiJNaWNyb3NvZnQgT3V0bG9vayBXZWIgQXBwIiwiWC1BcHBWZXJzaW9uIjoiMjAyNTEwMjQwMDYuMDEiLCJPUyI6IldpbmRvd3MgMTEifQ%3D%3D)\n\n**For .NET developers** (based on [your feedback](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Support-Installing-Missing-NET-SDK-Vers/10875301)) – If your project uses a pinned `global.json` , Setup Assistant provides a link matching the pinned .NET SDK, for quick installation in your browser.\n\n![Image of .NET Setup Assistant experience](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABLAAAAF0AQMAAAAJrlKJAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAATUlEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ43oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHg122wAAcTY3lAAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)\n\n### GitHub Copilot app modernization now built into Visual Studio\n\nThe GitHub Copilot app modernization agent is an AI-powered tool in Visual Studio that helps you upgrade your projects to newer versions and migrate them to Azure. It automatically detects outdated dependencies and target frameworks, provides guided recommendations, and makes real-time code changes, so you can modernize your code without interruptions. Migrating to Azure unlocks scalability, security, and operational efficiency for your projects.\n\n**How to get started:**\n\nOpen your project or solution in Visual Studio, then launch the Modernization Agent by right-clicking your project or solution and selecting **Modernize**, or type @modernize in Copilot Chat with your upgrade or migration request.\n\nWhen new SDKs or toolsets become available, you can easily retarget your entire solution or specific projects with the Setup Assistant. Simply reopen this tab via **Project** &gt; **Retarget solution,** or right click your solution/project and select **Retarget solution**. This makes it simple to modernize projects.\n\nSee live examples\n\n- [C++ modernization by Michael Price](https://youtu.be/eCFb_VyNMWU)\n- [.NET modernization video by Brady Gaster and Cathy Sulivan](https://youtu.be/YDhJ953D6-U?t=2308)\n\n## Visual Studio is shipping faster\n\n**Visual Studio 2026 will get updates on the Stable channel every month**, bringing new features, performance improvements, security and bug fixes to you faster than ever.\n\n[Install Visual Studio 2026 Stable](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)\n\nVisual Studio Insiders will get updates even faster, helping us iterate with you in real time.
