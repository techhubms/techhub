  "EnhancedContent": "The September 2025 update for Visual Studio 2022 (v17.14) is now available. In this month, we are bringing you a fully integrated and game-changing agentic AI experience, from code generation to modernization, profiling, and code reviews.\n\n[![Summary photo of all the six updates in September](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJAAQMAAAApW4aWAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAXklEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7wYiTwAB/qbe0QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Slide101-scaled.jpg)\n\n## Profiler Agent\n\nWe’ve heard the feedback loud and clear developers love the Profiler Agent. So, we’re bringing it to **Visual Studio 2022** as well. It’s an AI-powered assistant built into Visual Studio that helps you find and fix performance issues without needing to be a profiling expert.\n\nThe Profiler Agent works with GitHub Copilot to:\n\n- Analyze CPU usage, memory, and runtime behavior\n\n- Highlight performance bottlenecks\n\n- Create or optimize **BenchmarkDotNet** benchmarks\n\n- Suggest fixes and validate improvements in a guided loop\n\nAfter turning on Agent Mode in Copilot chat window, you can interact with Profiler Agent in a few ways:\n\n- Tag it directly in Copilot chat: “@profiler Why is my app slow?”\n\n- Ask a natural question in Agent Mode: “Why is my frame rate dropping?”\n\n- Or simply click the **“Suggest how I can optimize my code”** starter prompt in New Copilot chat when you open any C# project.\n\nProfiler Agent takes the guesswork out of performance tuning. It shows you what’s wrong, suggests what to try, and confirms whether the change really helps. It’s faster, simpler, and approachable for anyone, new or experienced. Currently, it supports high CPU usage analysis and .NET object allocations, with more scenarios coming soon.\n\n[![Using profiler agent to run benchmark and optimize code](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAH3AQMAAAB5GqmVAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAR0lEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANwYxnMAAUs5LMgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/profiler-agent-1-1.gif)\n\n## .NET Application Modernization\n\nThe [GitHub Copilot app modernization agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/github-copilot-app-modernization-overview) is an AI-powered tool in Visual Studio that helps you upgrade .NET applications to newer versions and migrate them to Azure.\n\nTo try out the app modernization agent, you should:\n\n1. Open your .NET project or solution in Visual Studio.\n2. Launch the modernization agent using one of the following methods:\n1. Right-click the solution or project in Solution Explorer and select Modernize.\n– or –\n2. Open the Copilot Chat window and type @modernize followed by your upgrade request.\n3. Let the @modernize agent know what you’d like to upgrade or migrate.\n\nWith the app modernization agent, it’s easier than ever to keep your .NET apps up to date and take advantage of the latest Azure features. Give it a try and see how much time you can save!\n\n## Copilot Agent Mode Improvement\n\nOver the past few months, we’ve made significant updates to Agent Mode to improve reliability, responsiveness, and overall usability. Here are some of the improvements we’ve shipped:\n\n**Performance & Reliability**\n\n- Agent Mode now shows clearer progress indicators, so you always know what’s happening behind the scenes.\n\n- Improved prompt caching to speed up response times.\n\n**Working Set & File Management**\n\n- The working set now stays hidden when empty, and only shows a file count when relevant.\n\n- Rejected files are automatically deleted from disk and removed from the working set.\n\n- Items marked with **no changes** are now sorted to the bottom to reduce clutter.\n\n**Prompting & Planning**\n\n- Updated prompt formatting improves Agent Mode performance with GPT-5 models.\n\n- We’re testing a new planning tool that lets the model break down complex requests into smaller, trackable steps using a live-updating markdown file. Early benchmarks (including SWE-bench) show significant gains on multi-step tasks.\n\n**Build & Tool Control**\n\n- You can now disable automatic builds in Agent Mode. Open the tools menu next to the chat prompt and deselect `run_build `\nto take manual control.\n\n**Fixes & General Improvements**\n\n- Cancelling an Agent Mode request now works more reliably.\n\n- Resolved several issues where Agent Mode could stall or hang during tool execution.\n\nWe’re shipping updates every sprint. If you haven’t used Agent Mode in a while, now’s a great time to try it again. The experience is faster, smoother, and more stable – and we’re just getting started.\n\n## MCP Prompts, Resources, and Sampling\n\nThe **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables a powerful and standardized way for servers to expose structured prompts, contextual resources, and agentic behaviors to clients, enhancing how large language models operate within development environments.\n\n**Prompts and Prompt Templates**\n\nMCP prompts provide structured instructions tailored to specific tasks and server contexts, ensuring optimal responses from models. In Visual Studio, you can discover and insert these prompts via the **+ Reference** button in chat. Some prompts support **arguments**, allowing for customization, which are known as **prompt templates**.\n\n**Resources and Resource Templates**\n\nMCP Resources offer contextual data such as files, schemas, or app-specific information, referenced using a **#URI** in chat. Like prompts, resources can be customized using **resource templates**, which are configured through the same **+ Reference** dialog. Once added, these resources become referenceable in chat, enriching model interactions with relevant context.\n\n**Sampling**\n\nMCP Sampling introduces agentic capabilities by allowing servers to initiate LLM calls internally. This reverses the typical flow and enables servers to request model actions. Visual Studio supports this feature natively. When sampling is beneficial, you’ll be prompted with a confirmation dialog detailing the request before execution.\n\nTo learn more about these new functionalities with examples, see: [Getting the most out of MCP in Visual Studio with Prompts, Resources, and Sampling – Visual Studio Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/mcp-prompts-resources-sampling/)\n\n## Generate and view Mermaid diagrams with Copilot\n\nWe are excited to announce that Visual Studio now supports rendering [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) diagrams in the Markdown editor, where you can provide your own Mermaid syntax or have Copilot generate it for you! This new feature lets you visualize complex data structures and workflows directly within your editor, which would previously require an extension.\n\nYou can prompt Copilot to generate architectural, flowchart, sequence, class, Gantt diagrams, pie charts or [any other kind of mermaid diagram](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/#diagram-types) to visualize abstract concepts.\n\nIf you don’t have any ideas yet, try out the following prompts:\n\n- Create a sequence diagram for the API call flow\n\n- Visualize the relationships between entities in this schema\n\n- Create a Mermaid state diagram for the lifecycle of a task\n\n- I’m new to this project, visualize major components and their relationships to help me onboard\n\nCopilot will read any attached references or related files in your codebase to grab necessary contexts and then return the Mermaid syntax in an embedded chat window. Simply click the **Preview** button, a new markdown file will open, and the Mermaid diagram will be displayed in preview.\n\n[![Copilot Chat Window with a wrapped response of mermaid syntax, and the preview button is circled out](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAggAAAIPAQMAAAAsN7SYAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAOElEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALwZh94AAaYbEC4AAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Mermaid1-1.png)\n\n[![A markdown editor where the left side is the mermaid syntax and the right side is the rendered mermaid chart](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAB8kAAAQVAQMAAAALgGmCAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAABFUlEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ43oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALgwA0wAB/SYf6wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Mermaid2.png)\n\n## Smarter code reviews\n\nWe’ve made a major update to our [local code review](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/catch-issues-before-you-commit-to-git/) process, now powered by [GitHub Copilot’s latest advancements for code review](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-copilot-code-review-now-generally-available/). This integration elevates the quality of code reviews, making them smarter and more efficient. Now you can expect similar quality of code reviews to github.com and receive the reviews one step earlier right inside Visual Studio.\n\n[![screenshot of the version control tab and the mouse cursor is pointing at the local code review icon ](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAlgAAAFQAQMAAABZE5JvAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAL0lEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAwK8BY8AAAYdotDQAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/17.14_local_code_review_icon.png)\n\nExperience smarter code reviews in Visual Studio with comments that are more insightful and precise, thanks to advanced reasoning models and improved prompting. Enjoy faster and more thorough reviews with optimized comment generation that covers your entire change set.\n\nTo give you more control over the responses, custom instructions are now supported for local code review. Like how you would [enable custom instructions for Copilot Chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/copilot-chat-context?view=vs-2022#enable-custom-instructions), you can [create/add](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot) a custom instructions file `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the root of your repository.\n\nTo use this feature, ensure your GitHub Copilot subscription is active and enabled within Visual Studio. If you don’t already have GitHub Copilot, you can sign up for free [here](https://github.com/settings/copilot).\n\nYou’ll need to enable the necessary feature flags:\n\n- Tools &gt; Options &gt; Preview Features &gt; Pull Request Comments\n\n- Tools &gt; Options &gt; GitHub &gt; Copilot &gt; Source Control Integration &gt; Enable Git preview features.\n\nThen, you’ll see a new sparkle comment button in the Git Changes window. Clicking on this button allows GitHub Copilot to review your local code changes and provide inline suggestions.\n\n### Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!
