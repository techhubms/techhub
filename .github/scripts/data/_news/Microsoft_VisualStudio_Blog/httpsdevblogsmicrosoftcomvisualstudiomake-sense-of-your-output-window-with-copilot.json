For years, developers have relied on the Output Window for critical build and debug information. But making sense of it—and translating it into action—has been a challenge. What if you could instantly ask questions about your logs and take action without leaving your workflow? Now you can, thanks to Copilot’s new Output Window context!\n\n### [![Output window in the attachment context window](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARsAAAEsAQMAAADJnIV3AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAIUlEQVRoge3BAQ0AAADCoPdP7ewBFAAAAAAAAAAAAABwAytcAAFPJdEKAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/image001.png)\n\n### Say hello to smarter output window assistance\n\nIn Visual Studio 17.14, Copilot can now read your Output Window, making it possible to interact with your build and debug logs like never before. Instead of wading through log files and searching for answers, simply ask Copilot questions about the output—whether you’re facing build errors, warnings, or just want to understand what’s happening behind the scenes.\n\n### How does the Output Window context work?\n\nIf you’re looking at the output window, you can highlight the logs you want Copilot to help you understand, right click and invoke Copilot Chat. This works in the Build, Debug, Tests, Source Control, Package Manager, or whatever is your active output window. Additionally, if you’re facing an issue, Copilot may opt to take a look on your behalf, especially if you mention the output window with natural language in your prompts. Copilot analyzes the contents of the Output Window, provides helpful explanations, and even suggests next steps.\n\n### Why this feature matters for developers\n\nThe Output Window is a goldmine of information, but its sheer volume and complexity can slow you down. By bridging the gap between raw logs and actionable solutions, Copilot empowers you to debug faster, learn more, and focus on what matters—building great software. This integration is designed to boost productivity, reduce frustration, and help every developer, from beginner to expert, unlock the full power of Visual Studio.\n\n### Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!
