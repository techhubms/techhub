Maybe you want guidance on the latest web framework, documentation, or project-specific resources—but Copilot’s responses just aren’t specific enough. For developers who rely on up-to-date or esoteric answers, this gap can be a real frustration.\n\n## URL Context: Bringing the web into Copilot Chat\n\nWith the new URL context feature, Copilot Chat can now access and use information directly from web pages you specify. By pasting a URL into your Copilot Chat prompt, you empower Copilot to pull real-time, relevant information from the source. This means more tailored responses.

When you need Copilot to answer using a specific web resource, simply paste the desired URL into your chat prompt. Copilot will then process the contents of that page, giving you context-aware answers that go beyond its original training. This opens the door to more personalized support.\n\n### Limitations to keep in mind\n\nWhile the URL context feature is powerful, there are a few things to remember. Copilot’s ability to extract and understand content depends on the accessibility of the web page and the clarity of its information. Some sites might have authentication restrictions or have dynamic content that limit Copilot’s ability to read the web page’s content. Always review responses for accuracy and completeness, especially when referencing complex or highly technical sources.\n\n## Check out the new Visual Studio Hub\n\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!
