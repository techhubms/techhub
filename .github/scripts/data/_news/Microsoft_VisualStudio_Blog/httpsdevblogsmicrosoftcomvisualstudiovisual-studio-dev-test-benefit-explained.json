  "EnhancedContent": "Before joining Microsoft, I served as VP of Application Development at one of the largest temporary staffing companies in the United States. I‚Äôll never forget the look on our CFO‚Äôs face when I told him we needed two to three additional cloud environments to support a large-scale modernization project. His expression went from curious to cautious as he started calculating what that might mean for compute, storage, and database costs.\n\n‚ÄúYou want three more cloud environments? Do you have any idea what that‚Äôs going to cost us each month?‚Äù\n\nHe wasn‚Äôt wrong to ask. Expanding our cloud footprint could easily double our monthly spend. What he didn‚Äôt realize was that we already had a built-in advantage‚Äî**a Visual Studio Subscription benefit that provides discounted Dev/Test rates for non-production workloads in Azure.**\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nLike many enterprises, we were expanding our cloud footprint to support a modernization effort that touched multiple systems across accounting, ticketing, and field operations. Running in parallel across so many integration streams required more than just production and staging. We needed additional cloud environments for accounting integration, API modernization, mobile development, and quality assurance ‚Äî each one mirroring production as closely as possible.\n\nThe challenge wasn‚Äôt technical, it was financial. Every new environment meant more compute, more storage, and higher monthly costs. Our CFO was right to ask where that money would come from.\n\nThat‚Äôs when I discovered something already included in our Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise subscriptions ‚Äî the [Azure Dev/Test benefit](https://aka.ms/vss-devtest).\n\n[![Azure DevTest Savings Examples image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABQAAAALQAQMAAAD1s08VAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAh0lEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQlPoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4GsTfAAEHwLKaAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/dev-test#discounts)\n\nThis benefit allows Visual Studio subscribers to run Windows and SQL Server VMs in Azure at the same base rates as Linux VMs of equivalent size. The Microsoft licensing costs are waived for development and testing, so you only pay for compute while it‚Äôs running. It‚Äôs a simple change with major impact: production-level environments for non-production costs.\n\n## The Pilot That Changed Everything\n\nWith cautious approval, I launched a pilot to test the Dev/Test benefit in action. Within a week, our team replicated the entire production environment in Azure using discounted Dev/Test rates. There were no procurement delays, no licensing complexities, and no approval bottlenecks‚Äîjust straightforward cloud provisioning with real cost transparency.\n\nThat one-week turnaround shattered our assumptions about how quickly we could scale and test new workloads in the cloud.\n\n## Why Developers Love Dev/Test\n\nWhen I lead focus groups at [Visual Studio Live!](https://aka.ms/vss-vslive) events, I often ask developers which subscription benefits stand out beyond the IDE itself. The Azure Dev/Test benefit consistently ranks near the top. Developers tell me the same two things every time:\n\n- **Prototyping freedom:** they can spin up environments on demand to test ideas without waiting for budget approvals.\n- **Production-grade testing:** they can validate integrations and updates in environments that mirror production, without the production-level price tag.\n\nIt‚Äôs one of the most valuable capabilities hidden in plain sight. Every Professional and Enterprise annual subscription includes access to these discounted Dev/Test rates for non-production workloads.\n\n## Scaling the Solution\n\nOnce we proved the model worked, we expanded quickly. Using the Visual Studio Dev/Test benefit, our cloud environment evolved from a handful of shared test spaces into a scalable system that supported every stream of work:\n\n- **Dedicated environments for each integration area**\n- **Parallel development that removed team bottlenecks**\n- **On-demand provisioning that could be started or stopped as needed**\n- **Minimal oversight required from IT operations**\n\nBecause the benefit handled the licensing automatically, our IT pros no longer had to manage or approve environment requests. They stayed focused on higher-value initiatives while developers created the test environments they needed in minutes.\n\nThe result was faster releases, greater agility, and significantly lower operational costs.\n\n## Hidden Advantages\n\nBeyond the speed and savings, several additional benefits became clear:\n\n- **Parallel velocity:** multiple teams could work independently without stepping on each other‚Äôs code.\n- **Risk-free innovation:** the reduced cost of experimentation encouraged creative problem-solving.\n- **Realistic validation:** production-like conditions made deployments smoother and more predictable.\n- **Operational simplicity:** no hardware maintenance, no software installs, and fewer administrative blockers.\n\nWhat started as a cost-saving pilot ended up transforming how we delivered software across the organization.\n\n## How You Can Get Started\n\nVisual Studio subscribers can access Azure Dev/Test pricing through one of three paths:\n\n- [**Enterprise Dev/Test**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0148p/): available to organizations with an **Enterprise Agreement (EA)**. This option provides centralized billing and the broadest management capabilities for teams running multiple non-production environments.\n- [**Pay-As-You-Go Dev/Test**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0023p/): ideal for **individual developers or small teams** with **Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscriptions** who are **not covered under an Enterprise Agreement**.\n- [**Azure Plan for Dev/Test**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0148g/): designed for customers with **Microsoft Customer Agreements (MCA)**, offering simplified modern billing and flexibility as organizations transition away from legacy agreements.\n\nEach path unlocks the same Dev/Test discounts already included with your Visual Studio subscription, helping you run Windows and SQL Server workloads in Azure at significantly reduced rates for development and testing.\n\n## The Takeaway\n\nMost IT leaders still think of Visual Studio subscriptions as just IDE licenses. In reality, the [**Azure Dev/Test benefit**](https://aka.ms/vss-devtest) is one of the fastest ways to reduce cloud spend while accelerating development.\n\nSeveral customers have told me this single benefit can easily justify the full cost of a Visual Studio subscription through cloud-computing savings alone.\n\nThe real question isn‚Äôt whether you can afford to modernize. The real question is whether you can afford **not** to take advantage of the benefits you already own.\n\nüëâ **Sign in to [my.visualstudio.com](https://aka.ms/myvs)** today to explore Azure Dev/Test pricing and see how it can accelerate your next project.",
