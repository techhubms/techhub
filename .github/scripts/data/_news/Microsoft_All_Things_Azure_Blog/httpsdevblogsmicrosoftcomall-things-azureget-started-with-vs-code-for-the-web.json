This browser-based environment removes setup time, reduces friction, and gives you immediate access to pre-configured runtimes, GitHub tools, and Azure integrations. As a result, you can start building, editing, and deploying the moment inspiration strikes. For more info, view our [VS Code Docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/vscodeforweb).\n\n[![azurescreenshot image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAADOAQMAAAC+SK0LAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAH0lEQVRYhe3BgQAAAADDoPlTH+ECVQEAAAAAAAAA3wAfYgABtwaApQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/11/azurescreenshot.webp)\n\n## Build in the Browser with a Ready-to-Use Azure Environment\n\n[VS Code for the Web – Azure](https://vscode.dev/azure) opens directly in your browser, and it loads a workspace that includes Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Git support, and the Azure Developer CLI (azd). Because everything is ready on day one, you can focus on writing code instead of configuring environments.\n\nIn addition, you can open any GitHub repository, make changes, and commit them without leaving the browser. This workflow helps you iterate quickly and avoid context switching. When you want to continue working locally, you can simply choose “Continue on Desktop” to transition smoothly to the full VS Code app.\n\n## Start Even Faster with New Entry Points\n\nTo help developers ramp up even quicker, we introduced two new ways to launch VS Code for the Web – Azure. These entry points create a fast and intuitive path from AI-generated code to a fully editable workspace.\n\n### **Start from Microsoft Foundry**\n\nYou can now open Foundry-generated agents directly in VS Code for the Web – Azure. Here’s how:\n\n1. Visit the **Microsoft Foundry home page** at [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com).\n2. Review the code snippet Foundry suggests for your scenario.\n3. Select **Open in VS Code** to launch the snippet instantly in the VS Code for the Web – Azure workspace.\n\nBecause this workflow removes unnecessary steps, you can refine, test, and deploy your agent right away.\n\n### **Start from Azure Copilot in the Azure Portal**\n\nWe also added an integration with Azure Copilot in the Azure Portal. This flow helps you go from AI-generated code to a development-ready workspace with a single click.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Sign in to the **Azure Portal** at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).\n2. Open **Azure Copilot** and create the scenario you want to build.\n3. After Copilot generates your code, select the file and choose **Open in VS Code**.\n4. Edit and extend the code in VS Code for the Web – Azure.\n5. Use **GitHub Copilot** inside the editor to refine your implementation.\n\nThis connection bridges AI guidance and hands-on development, allowing you to iterate smoothly.\n\n## Move from AI to Code to Cloud with Less Friction\n\nWith these integrations, you can move quickly at every stage of the development process. You start with AI-suggested code, transition immediately to a ready-to-use workspace, and deploy through built-in Azure tools. Because everything works together, you spend more time building features and less time wiring up environments.\n\n## Try VS Code for the Web – Azure Today\n\nVS Code for the Web – Azure offers a fast, intuitive way to develop cloud applications. With new entry points from Foundry and Azure Copilot, you can open, edit, and deploy code in seconds. As we continue improving the experience, these integrations will play an even bigger role in helping you ship more efficiently.\n\nIf you want, I can also create: ✅ a shorter SEO-optimized version, ✅ a more formal enterprise version, or ✅ a developer-focused deep-dive version.\n\n**AI-assisted content.** This article was partially created with the help of AI.
