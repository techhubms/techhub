  "EnhancedContent": "While the promise of AI continues to generate momentum, many organizations face a familiar challenge: getting AI projects beyond the prototype phase. According to Gartner, only 30% of AI initiatives make it into production, and RAND reports that up to 80% fail to deliver expected outcomes.\n\nThe problem isn’t model quality — it’s platform readiness. To deliver AI successfully, you need more than cloud infrastructure. You need a repeatable, secure, and governed platform built for modern, data-intensive workloads.\n\n## The Shift: From Running AI in the Cloud to Building the Cloud for AI\n\nDeploying AI workloads in the cloud introduces operational complexity:\n\n- Infrastructure must be provisioned across teams and environments.\n\n- Models and pipelines need secure access to sensitive data.\n\n- Agent-based systems require controlled permissions and execution boundaries.\n\n- Environments must meet enterprise security, compliance, and audit requirements.\n\nAI workloads aren’t traditional apps — they span services, APIs, users, and machine-to-machine communication. And the attack surface grows with each agent or integration introduced.\n\nRather than solving these problems after the fact, platform teams are adopting an infrastructure-as-code approach to AI environments, treating security and scalability as part of the delivery pipeline.\n\n## HashiCorp + Azure: Automate the AI Infrastructure Lifecycle\n\nUsing HashiCorp and Azure, platform teams can build an automated foundation for secure and scalable AI deployments.\n\n1. Provision repeatable environments with Terraform and Azure Verified Modules\n\nDefine infrastructure as code using Terraform and deploy Azure resources — including compute, networking, and storage — using Azure Verified Modules that follow Microsoft’s standards. This enables repeatable, production-grade environments with built-in compliance and best practices.\n\n2. Secure access with Vault\n\nUse Vault to centrally manage access to credentials, secrets, and sensitive data. Vault supports dynamic secrets, identity-based access, and control groups for human-in-the-loop approval — critical for managing access to LLMs, data pipelines, and prompt injection risks.\n\n[![HashiCorp blog visual
