Tools to help capture cognitive indicators can help us change how we think, feel and act in high stress situations for the better.\n\n## **🤖 Meet Your Cognitive Copilot**\n\nImagine an AI agent that quietly observes your indicators relating to cognitive activity, learns your patterns, and supports you in real-time. With breakthrough technologies like fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy), this isn’t science fiction – it’s happening now. The market has shifted to the new frontier especially those looking for an edge!\n\nThese agents don’t replace human judgment; **they supercharge it.** 💪\n\n## **🎯 Game-Changing Applications**\n\n**🏆 Sports & Performance:**\n\n- ⛳ Golfers receive real-time emotional regulation insights for shot accuracy\n[![Golfer](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAADJAQMAAACjTZ2zAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHklEQVRYhe3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQo/oAAAAAAAAADgbh6fAAHuhf4jAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/20250614_golfer_003-min.png)\n- 🏈 High impact sports to understand impact and relative blood flow response\n[![Football](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAACZAQMAAACvw5VEAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHUlEQVRYhe3BgQAAAADDoPlTH+ECVQEAAAAAAMcAF08AAW8JAr4AAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/20250526_football_example.png)\n- 🏎️ Formula 1 & motorsport drivers get cognitive load monitoring for optimal race communications, feedback during training, and cues for when to take a deep breathe\n[20250605_motorsports_SF_003](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/20250605_motorsports_SF_003.mov) [![20250526 motorsports INX0896 min image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAADIAQMAAABoEU4WAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHklEQVRYhe3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQdvoAAAAAAAAADgNx54AAHw+DPXAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/20250526_motorsports_INX0896-min-scaled.jpg) *Credit: @[Ivan Novotny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-novotny-5a82461/), @[Sam Fellows](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-fellows-b84b42232/), @[Jim Bowie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimbowielinked/)/Motovitesse*\n\n**See it in action**\n\nVisit [motorsports.blueberryx.com](https://motorsports.blueberryx.com) to see this in action (hosted on azure)\n\n**⚕️ High-Stakes Professions:**\n\n- ✈️ Pilots optimizing communication timing and focus cues\n- 🔬 Surgeons get stress alerts before fine motor control deteriorates\n- ⛏️ Mining operators prevent accidents through cognitive overload detection\n\n[![20250527 pilot 001 min image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAADHAQMAAACZR/zDAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHklEQVRYhe3BgQAAAADDoPlTX+AIVQEAAAAAAADAMR5RAAFMlbn1AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/20250527_pilot_001-min.png)\n\n**💼 Workplace Innovation:**\n\n- 👩‍⚕️ Doctors managing emotional regulation during traumatic cases\n- 💻 Developers tracking mental fatigue to boost productivity\n- 👥 Leaders understanding how cognitive load impacts their teams\n- 📈 Stockbrokers receive fatigue warnings before poor decision patterns emerge\n\n## **Beyond Basic Wearables**\n\nUnlike simple fitness trackers, these agents use contextualized intelligence. 🧠 Azure’s TypeAgent BCI Sample combines: • 🌊 Cognitive indicator data • 👁️ Audio and visual inputs • 📍 Location and calendar context • ❤️ Biometric signals\n\nThe result? Personalized, situationally aware assistants that understand how your cognitive state shifts across different environments, tasks, and social contexts. 🎯\n\nBio-sensing technology such as fNIRS is modular and small. This means it can fit into a variety of form factors such as eyeglass, hats, headphones and headbands.\n\nThe adaptability of this technology while providing indicators including ❤️ pulse rate, 😊 muscle movements (face and eye) and 🩸 deep tissue blood flow response. fNIRS bio-sensing is a great tool for any wearable that needs to include indicators for cognition.\n\n[![202505 blueberry eyeglass min image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAAB9AQMAAAAiFszQAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAG0lEQVRYhe3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAMCFARMLAAFNoM13AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/202505-blueberry-eyeglass-min-scaled.png) *Credit: Blueberry X’s bio-sensor fNIRS module with an eyeglass[![202505 sales deck icons image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAACDAQMAAAANjrS5AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAG0lEQVRYhe3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAABwZRP1AAGqhvVAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/202505-sales-deck-icons.png)*\n\n## **🪞Your Digital Cognitive Mirror**\n\nOver time, these agents create a living model of your mental patterns – a cognitive heuristic that gets smarter with every interaction. Think of it as a mirror that reflects not just how you look, but how you think, feel, and perform.\n\nThis becomes your ultimate tool for: • 🔍 Self-awareness • 🚀 Performance optimization • 🎯 Strategic decision-making *[![20250526 dashboard snapshot image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAAC7AQMAAADlpzF5AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHklEQVRYhe3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQlPoAAAAAAAAAAOBhx9AAFEchpGAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/all-things-azure/wp-content/uploads/sites/83/2025/06/20250526_dashboard_snapshot.png)*\n\n## **🛠️ The Builder’s Opportunity**\n\nFor developers, product managers, and innovation teams, this represents a massive market opportunity – the foundation for adaptive, insight-driven workplace tools that are deeply personal.\n\n**🔥 Critical applications include:** • 🚨 Emergency responders maintaining clarity under pressure • 📊 Financial analysts optimizing decision-making during market volatility • 🏭 Factory operators ensuring safety through cognitive monitoring • 🏢 Corporate teams maximizing performance and well-being\n\n## **🔧 How it could work**\n\n![End-to-end architecture for the TypeAgent BCI sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/typeagent-bci-sample/blob/main/public/blog_architecture.png?raw=true)\n\n**Input streams.** Neuro-signals from the BlueberryX headset (fNIRS) plus heart-rate, Teams messages, email, voice, and other sensor data is fused into *Event Grid* or *Event Hubs*. This normalizes everything into a single, time-stamped event feed.\n\n**Meta agent orchestration.** A *Meta Agent* (built with *TypeAgent* or other orchestrators) sits in Azure Container Apps and delegates tasks to specialized sub agents – email replies, guided meditation, deep-breath prompts, design generation, and even golf-stroke analysis.\n\n**Reasoning & content generation.** Each agent taps *Azure AI Foundry* models (gpt-4o, o3, dall-e etc.) through the new *AI Agents Service*, gaining tools for Bing search, function calls, and knowledge retrieval.\n\n**State & search.** Long-term context and time-series data land in *Cosmos DB*, while text and multi-modal embeddings are indexed with *Azure AI Search* for fast RAG-style look-ups.\n\n**Actionable outputs.** The agent swarm produces real-time dashboards, research reports, adaptive meditation scripts, and even AI-generated diagrams – each tailored to the user’s current cognitive state.\n\n## **⏰ The Time is Now**\n\nIf you’re building solutions that make humans more aware, capable, and in control of their inner state, **we want to connect with you.** 🤝\n\n**🚀 Ready to explore?** • 🔬 Dive into the [Azure’s TypeAgent BCI Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/typeagent-bci-sample) • 🌟 Join our community of builders and pioneers • 💙 Discover fNIRS bio-sensing at [blueberryx.com](https://www.blueberryx.com/)\n\nThe future of emotionally intelligent tools starts with you.
