Shree here. Iâ€™m sure many of you have had a similar chat with someone you know. We often hesitate to celebrate our achievements because of social perceptions around self-promotion. I believe itâ€™s time to challenge that mindset. Building a personal site is about owning your narrative and showcasing your work with pride. In this post, Iâ€™ll show you how to launch your very first personal site (or, a portfolio piece) using GitHub Pages, a simple way to host a static website directly from GitHub. Youâ€™ll learn how to create a remote repository, store your siteâ€™s code, and deploy it to the web. Plus, Iâ€™ll share tips on using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and [GitHub Copilot agent mode](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/agent-mode-101-all-about-github-copilots-powerful-mode/) to speed up your workflow and get things done faster. By the end, youâ€™ll gain confidence to have a live site and the confidence to share your story with the world.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nGitHub account with a Free or Pro plans. If you donâ€™t have one, refer [Creating an account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account#1-creating-an-account) to sign up for an account.\n\n### From Code to Live: The Codespaces and Copilot agent mode workflow for launching a website\n\nI created a public remote repository, `shchinnasamy.github.io` . I chose to add a `README` and appropriate license type. You must set the repository to Public to publish your site. Unless you have GitHub Pro, you can only publish a GitHub page if the repository is public. Keep this in mind if you donâ€™t want to share your siteâ€™s source code publicly. Refer [Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) to learn more about creating a new repository.\n\nIn my case, I liked the style of [Jon Barron](https://jonbarron.info/)â€˜s public academic website. So, I cloned the [source code](https://github.com/jonbarron/jonbarron.github.io) of Jon Barronâ€™s website and customized them. Thanks much, Jon! I cloned Jonâ€™s website source code repository to a GitHub Codespaces and not to my local computer. This eliminated the tedious setup of a local development environment and got me to a working state faster. Refer [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository) to learn how to clone a repository from [GitHub.com](http://github.com/) to a Codespaces.\n\nI used GitHub Copilot Chat in GitHub to understand the structure of the cloned repository. Refer [Submitting a question to Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-chat/use-chat-in-github#submitting-a-question-to-copilot-chat) to learn more.\n\nNow that Iâ€™ve a grip on how Jonâ€™s website is structured, Iâ€™ll walk you through how I customized it for my website. I used Copilot agent mode and handed a high-level natural language prompt. I recorded a clip of how Copilot autonomously planned the steps, selected the right files, runs command, and iterated on code edits until the task is complete. In other words, Copilot made changes to files such as `index.html` and CNAME, files/directories to be deleted etc. Should you need to learn more about other Copilot chat modes, refer our colleague, Ashleyâ€™s [Copilot ask, edit, and agent modes: What they do and when to use them](https://www.notion.so/Your-6-Step-Guide-to-Deploying-a-Website-with-GitHub-Codespaces-and-Copilot-agent-mode-2678f46d7aed80a49bdff27c45ef2eec?pvs=21) blog post.\n\nAs a final touch, I finished by updating my `index.html, README` and uploaded a headshot and logos to the `/images` directory.\n\nNow that my remote repository is ready with my websiteâ€™s code and files, I proceed to deploy to the web with GitHub. I configured GitHub Pages site to publish when changes are pushed to a specific branch (in my case, `/main` branch). GitHub Pages are one of the best features of GitHub. It is a service that allows you to host a static website directly from a GitHub repository. This means you can use your repository to store your websiteâ€™s code and files, and GitHub will automatically publish them as a website you can access online. On that note, I now have a personal (and secure) GitHub Pages site at `https://shchinnasamy.github.io `\n\n(Optional) While I ignored, you can change the root of the siteâ€™s URL from the default, like `shchinnasamy.github.io` , to any domain you own. Refer [About custom domains and GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages) to learn more.\n\nBy following these six steps, I was able to quickly deploy my personal website using GitHub Pages, Codespaces, and Copilot agent mode. The combination of these powerful tools made the process straightforward and enjoyable, even for a beginner. From setting up the repository to customizing the template and configuring my domain, each step was manageable with the right guidance. Now I have a professional-looking website that I can continue to develop and improve over time.\n\n### Onward\n\nReady to create your own website? Sign up for a GitHub account today and follow these steps to get your personal site up and running in no time. Remember, you donâ€™t need advanced coding skills or expensive hosting services to establish your online presence. With GitHubâ€™s suite of tools, you can focus on creating content while the platform handles the technical aspects of deployment.
