Today, we're excited to announce Private Marketplace for VS Code—a dedicated, enterprise-ready hub that puts you in full control of how extensions are sourced, reviewed, and distributed to your dev teams. 🔐✨\n\n## With the Private Marketplace, you can:\n\n- Curate exactly which extensions appear for your organization, whether they're internal tools or trusted public plugins.\n- Lock down sensitive IP by privately hosting your own extensions—no more sharing proprietary code outside your firewall.\n- Easily rehost vetted public extensions after your own checks, so your teams can use familiar tools in secure or air-gapped environments.\n- Roll out everything centrally—new users get a consistent, up-to-date catalog from day one.\n\n## Same great VS Code experience\n\nFully integrated into the VS Code experience, your developers will find, install, and update extensions as easily as ever—without leaving the safety of your managed ecosystem. No more ticket-based installs, zip file confusion, or security compromises.\n\n![VS Code Private Marketplace](/assets/blogs/2025/11/18/vscpmga.png)\n\nNote\n\nPrivate Marketplace is available to GitHub Enterprise customers. VS Code users must sign in with a GitHub Enterprise or Copilot Business or Enterprise account to access.\n\n## Getting started\n\nReady to streamline, secure, and scale your extension management? Start with our deployment guide now and bring peace of mind to both your developers and your IT team.\n\n👉 See [deployment and feature guide](https://aka.ms/private-marketplace/readme) for instructions, scripts, and environment setup.\n\n💬 Need help?
