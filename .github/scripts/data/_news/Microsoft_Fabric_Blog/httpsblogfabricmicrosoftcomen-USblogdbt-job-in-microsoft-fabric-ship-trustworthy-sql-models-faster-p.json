  "EnhancedContent": "We’re excited to introduce dbt Jobs in Microsoft Fabric—a capability that lets existing dbt users seamlessly integrate their trusted workflows into Fabric’s Data Factory experience. With this integration, data engineers and analysts can author, orchestrate, and operationalize dbt-based transformations natively within Fabric, combining the modular, version-controlled, and testable approach you already know with enterprise-grade governance, CI/CD, and monitoring. By unifying code-first flexibility with low-code options, Fabric empowers analytics and engineering teams to collaborate effortlessly and scale transformations across the organization—all within a secure, governed, and familiar environment.\n\nWe’re also thrilled to announce a **close collaboration between dbt Labs and Microsoft Fabric**. As part of this collaboration, we’re working to bring **dbt Fusion** into Microsoft Fabric, delivering next-generation performance and advanced developer capabilities. This will become available in calendar year 2026.\n\n## Why dbt and Why It Matters\n\ndbt has become the industry standard for SQL-based data transformation, trusted by thousands of organizations worldwide. Here’s why:\n\n- **SQL-Native Approach**: dbt empowers analytics engineers to transform data using SQL—the language they already know—without needing complex ETL tools or proprietary scripting.\n\n- **Version Control & Testing**: Built-in testing and documentation ensure data quality and transparency, reducing risk and improving trust in analytics.\n\n- **Scalable Collaboration**: dbt promotes modular, reusable models, enabling teams to collaborate effectively across large-scale projects.\n\n![dbt momentum sldie](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-103-1024x571.png)dbt momentum\n\nBy bringing dbt natively into Microsoft Fabric, we eliminate friction:\n\n- **No CLI Setup or Local Dependencies**: Everything runs in a serverless, managed runtime—no jump-outs, no extra tooling.\n\n- **Unified Experience**: Author, schedule, and monitor dbt jobs alongside other Fabric activities in one place.\n\n- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Leverage Entra ID authentication, workspace roles, and SQL RLS/CLS/OLS policies so transformations inherit governance by default.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\n- **Native Authoring**: Create and manage dbt projects directly in Fabric Data Factory.\n\n- **Integrated Testing & Documentation**: Validate models and maintain documentation without leaving Fabric.\n\n- **Operationalization**: Automate runs with built-in scheduling and monitoring.\n\n- **Performance & Reliability**: Powered by Fabric’s distributed architecture for robust execution.\n\n- **Governance by Design**: Enterprise security controls applied automatically to every transformation.\n\n[![dbt demo gif](https://azureblobshare.blob.core.windows.net/gif/dbt%20job%20getting%20started.gif)](https://azureblobshare.blob.core.windows.net/gif/dbt%20job%20getting%20started.gif)Getting started with the Jaffle Shop dbt project\n\n## Getting Started\n\n*The tenant admin dbt job preview enablement UI will roll out to all regions in the coming weeks (December 2025).*\n\nFabric Tenant Admins can enable dbt Jobs via the Fabric Tenant Admin Portal:\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings → Admin Portal**.\n2. Under **Tenant Settings**, expand **Users can create dbt job items**.\n3. Toggle to **Enabled** and apply to your organization.\n\n![Admin portal view for enabling dbt job preview](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-55.png)Admin portal for enabling dbt job preview\n\nAfter enabling the dbt job preview, you can create dbt jobs in your workspaces.\n\n![Create new dbt job UI in fabric](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dbt-job-blog-demo1-1-1024x576.gif)Create a new dbt job\n\n## Resources\n\n- [dbt job overview](https://aka.ms/dbt-job-intro)",
