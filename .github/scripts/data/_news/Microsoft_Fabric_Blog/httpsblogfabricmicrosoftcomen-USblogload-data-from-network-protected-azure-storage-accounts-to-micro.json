AzCopy now supports copying data from firewall-enabled Azure Storage accounts into OneLake using trusted workspace access. Now you can use AzCopy to load data from even network-protected storage accounts, letting you effortlessly load data into OneLake without compromising on security or performance.\n\n## What is trusted workspace access\n\nTrusted workspace access in Microsoft Fabric allows you to securely access firewall-enabled Storage accounts from OneLake shortcuts, pipelines, DW copy, and semantic models. To set up trusted workspace access, you first create a workspace managed identity and then grant that identity access to the Azure Storage firewall using a resource instance rule. After set-up, your shortcuts, pipelines, DW copies, semantic models, and now AzCopy jobs in that workspace can automatically access that storage account, no additional work required!\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started copying data from your firewall-enabled storage accounts, you’ll need to complete the following steps.\n\n1. Create a workspace managed identity (if you don’t already have one).\n\nFor more details on creating and deploying a workspace identity, refer to the [creating a workspace managed identity](/fabric/onelake/onelake-azcopy) documentation.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/create-workspace-managed-identity-1024x577.png)Create a workspace managed identity in the workspace settings\n\n2. Configure the resource instance rule for your Azure Storage account.\n\nFor more details, including a sample ARM template, check out the guidelines for[resource instance rules](http://fabric/security/security-trusted-workspace-access#resource-instance-rule).\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/view-resource-instance-rule-1024x570.png)\n\n3. Copy your data with AzCopy. For more information about using AzCopy with OneLake, including sample copy operations, refer to [Moving data with OneLake and AzCopy](/fabric/onelake/onelake-azcopy).\n\n> >\n> azcopy copy\n> “https://contosostorage.dfs.core.windows.net/sales/customers.csv”\n> “http://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/contosoWorkspace/contosoLakehouse.Lakehouse/Files/sales/customers.csv”\n> –trusted-microsoft-suffixes “fabric.microsoft.com”\n> >\n\n## Learn more\n\n- [Get started with AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?tabs=dnf)\n- [Copy data with OneLake and AzCopy](/fabric/onelake/onelake-azcopy)\n- [Use trusted workspace access](/fabric/security/security-trusted-workspace-access#create-a-onelake-shortcut-to-storage-account-with-trusted-workspace-access%29)",
