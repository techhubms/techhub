  "EnhancedContent": "In today’s data-driven landscape, operational agility depends on the ability to respond to insights as they happen. Microsoft Fabric’s Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) is transforming the way organizations ingest, transform, and analyze their data, introducing new possibilities for immediate action and decision-making.\n\nFor organizations using Microsoft Fabric, integrating monitoring data from Azure resources is very relevant to their day-to-day operations. This capability enables real-time monitoring and diagnostics, allowing teams to gain actionable insights at the moment they are needed. By combining monitoring data with existing business data across all verticals, stored within Fabric, organizations can achieve a unified view that supports proactive management and rapid response across their entire operation.\n\nToday we are introducing the integration of Azure Monitor Diagnostic Logs directly into Fabric via Eventstream, enabling seamless ingestion of Azure resource logs into Fabric-native analytics workflows.\n\n## Why This Integration Matters\n\nFabric users with Azure resources had faced fragmented monitoring experience – routing diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to analytics platforms required multiple configuration steps, including setting up Event Hubs and managing authentication complexities. This new integration streamlines the process by allowing direct ingestion of Azure Monitor logs into Fabric Eventstream, reducing setup friction and improving operational inefficiency to gain holistic insights.\n\n### Capabilities\n\n- Efficiently route logs and metrics of Azure resources from Azure into Fabric.\n- Transform data logs for immediate use without a single line of code.\n- Combine diagnostic logs with other data sources for enriched, cross-vertical operational insights.\n- Ingest, visualize and act on data in real time, all within a unified platform.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe integration utilizes Fabric’s Eventstream to provide a streamlined workflow for ingesting Azure Monitor logs. Users begin by navigating to the Real-Time Hub within Fabric and selecting the Azure Diagnostics data source card. This interface allows users to efficiently search for specific Azure resources and apply filters based on source type, subscription, resource group, or region, making it simple to locate and view detailed resource attributes.\n\nOnce the desired resources are identified, users can initiate the end-to-end ingestion flow directly from the selected Azure resource. Within the workflow, users are able to select which logs and metrics to import into Fabric and may also configure the Eventhouse destination for the processed logs. This process enables the direct routing of Azure Monitor logs into Eventstream, where the logs can be transformed as needed. Subsequently, the transformed data can be sent to Fabric’s native destinations, including Eventhouse, Activator, and custom endpoints, supporting a seamless analytics workflow within the Fabric platform.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Azure Monitor Logs to Fabric Eventstream integration is more than a technical enhancement—it’s a strategic enabler for real-time operational intelligence. By simplifying ingestion and empowering analysis with access to data beyond Azure Monitor, it helps organizations make faster, smarter decisions.\n\n### Ready to experience it yourself?\n\nFollow the steps in the [Stream Azure Diagnostics to Fabric](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-hub/add-source-azure-diagnostic-logs-metrics?branch=release-fabcon-real-time-intelligence) documentation and start unlocking real-time operational intelligence in Fabric today!",
