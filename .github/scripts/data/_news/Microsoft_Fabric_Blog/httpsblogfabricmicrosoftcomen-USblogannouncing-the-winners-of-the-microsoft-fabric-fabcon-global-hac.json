By leveraging Microsoft Fabric’s unified architecture, participants demonstrated how organizations can:\n\n- **Modernize data estates** for agility and scalability.\n- **Harness Real-Time Intelligence** for faster decision-making.\n- **Integrate AI seamlessly** into mission-critical workflows.\n\nFrom **September 16 to November 3, 2025**, participants explored cutting-edge capabilities through weekly livestream learning sessions led by Microsoft experts. Following the momentum from the **Microsoft Fabric Community Conference in Vienna**, this hackathon showcased how Fabric accelerates innovation across **real-time analytics**, **AI-driven applications**, and **data modernization**.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nParticipants completed the [Microsoft Fabric Hackathon Skilling Plan](https://aka.ms/FabConHack-SkillingPlan) and built solutions across five distinct categories:\n\n- **Best AI application built with Microsoft Fabric**\n- **Best use of AI features**\n- **Analytics solutions with Azure Databases or databases in Fabric**\n- **Best use of Real-Time Intelligence**\n- **Best use of Open Mirroring**\n\n## The Winners\n\nOur judges selected standout solutions based on **innovation, impact, reproducibility, and demo quality. Congratulations to our winners!**\n\n| Winner | Location | Prize Category | Winning Project | Prize | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Giacomo C.** | Italy | **Grand Prize** | **HERO — Hybrid Emergency Route Optimizer** | **$2500** | | **Sammy C.

It solves a critical gap: emergency vehicles need routes optimized for their capabilities—not civilian traffic patterns.\n\nIn Lombardy, Italy, ambulances currently use consumer apps like Google Maps, which ignore siren privileges.HERO listens to dispatch events from Mirrored Azure SQL Database and when a dispatch arrives, the Activator triggers a Python notebook that calls Google Routes API for traffic-aware and no-traffic paths. An ML model predicts how much faster a siren-equipped vehicle can drive and selects the best route.\n\nReal-time data streams to Eventstream/KQL, simulates telemetry, and updates a Power BI map for control rooms. HERO can also send SMS alerts with static maps via Fabric Python User Data Functions.\n\n**Impact:** HERO enables predictive dispatching, fleet optimization, emergency analytics, and cross-agency coordination helping improve emergency response efficiency.\n\n**Technologies used:** Microsoft Fabric (Eventstream, KQL DB/Eventhouse, Activator, Notebooks, Lakehouse, UDFs, ML Model), Power BI, Azure Key Vault, Azure SQL Database, Google Routes API, and Twilio.\n\n[**View Project on GitHub**](https://github.com/Data4all-AI/hero)\n\nOur judges were truly impressed by the breadth, depth, and overall quality of the submissions.
