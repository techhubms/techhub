With native support for multiple delivery styles, including bulk copy, incremental copy, and change data capture (CDC) replication, Copy job offers the flexibility to handle a wide range of data movement scenarios—all through an intuitive, easy-to-use experience.\n\nThis update introduces several enhancements related to CDC capabilities, including more supported data source stores, destination stores and enhanced monitoring experience with more detailed statistics for watermark values, load type, and row counts for inserts, updates, and deletions.\n\n## **More CDC source store**\n\nCopy job now supports CDC (Change Data Capture) for even more sources, including SAP via Datasphere, Snowflake, and Google BigQuery.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1-1024x573.png)\n\nWith this enhancement, you can automatically capture inserts, updates, and deletions from these sources and replicate them to supported destinations—no watermark columns required, no manual refreshes, and no extra effort. This makes your data ingestion faster, more efficient, and reliable.\n\nIf you have interest to try Oracle CDC and more CDC source under Private Preview in Copy job, please feel free to submit your request [Copy Job Sign Up Form.](http://aka.ms/CopyJobCDCSignUp)\n\n## **Fabric Lakehouse table as CDC destination store**\n\nIn addition, Copy job now supports merging CDC data into more destinations, including Fabric Lakehouse.\n\nYou can seamlessly merge inserts, updates, and deletions from supported sources into Fabric Lakehouse tables, ensuring your data is always up to date.\n\n## **Observability enhancements for watermark info, load type, and detailed CDC statistics**\n\nWhat’s more, the monitoring experience of Copy job has been enhanced: you can now access more detailed statistics for each run, including watermark values, load type, and row counts for inserts, updates, and deletions, giving you full visibility over your Copy job.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-11-1024x367.png)\n\n## **Additional Resources**\n\nTo learn more, explore the [Microsoft Fabric Copy Job](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/what-is-copy-job) documentation.\n\nSubmit your feedback on [Fabric Ideas](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-Ideas/idb-p/fbc_ideas/label-name/data%20factory%20%7C%20copy%20job) and join the conversation in [the Fabric Community](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Copy-job/bd-p/db_copyjob).\n\nIf you have a question or want to share your feedback, please leave us a comment.",
