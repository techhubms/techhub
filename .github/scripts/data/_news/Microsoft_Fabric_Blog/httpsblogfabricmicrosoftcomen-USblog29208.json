In this blog I will share how you can deploy security configurations to semantic models and assign users to these roles using Fabric Notebooks with Semantic Link.\n\n## Data Engineering\n\n### Inturi Suparna Babu, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inturi-suparna-babu-312b59270/)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog: [DP-600 vs DP-700: Which Microsoft Certification Fits You Best?](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-platform-Community-Blog/DP-600-vs-DP-700-Which-Microsoft-Certification-Fits-You-Best/ba-p/4845762)\n\nIn this blog post, I’ll walk you through the key differences between Microsoft’s DP-600 and DP-700 certifications — helping you decide which path suits your skills, background, and career goals best.\n\n### Ignacio Barrau, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ignacio-barrau-b794b082/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [\\[Fabric\\] Entornos y librerías de código para tus notebooks](https://blog.ladataweb.com.ar/post/796774242908766208/fabric-entornos-y-librerías-de-código-para-tus)\n\nDesde sus inicios, Fabric, ha contado con capacidades varias para su código. Entre ellas, la instalación o delimitación de librerías o paquetes personalizados. Podían configurarse desde notebooks o por código. Sin embargo, todo eso fue cambiando hasta llegar a la versión definitiva que conocemos hoy.\n\nEn este artículo hablaremos de entornos o environments para conocer como trabajar en notebooks con librerías propias y que otras configuraciones contiene.\n\nComencemos como nos gusta hacer en LaDataWeb. Veamos la definición de libro, es decir, la que Microsoft dice de su componente:\n\n## Data Science\n\n### Jennifer Ratten, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-ratten-4759064/)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog: [Get Fabric Data Agents Running in Minutes – Fast, Easy, and For Everyone](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Science-Community-Blog/Get-Fabric-Data-Agents-Running-in-Minutes-Fast-Easy-and-For/ba-p/4848345)\n\nData Agents + Fast & Simple – No code, no drama, just pure BI magic. This user-friendly, step-by-step guide demonstrates how to get a Fabric data agent up and running quickly using a semantic model as the data source and having Copilot in Power BI do the heavy lifting.
