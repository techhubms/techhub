  "EnhancedContent": "Data silos slow innovation. Mirroring in Microsoft Fabric eliminates those barriers by bringing operational data into OneLake without complex ETL pipelines. The result, near real-time AI and BI insights, unified governance, and a single source of truth across your organization – all at no cost!\n\n## What’s Generally Available and why it matters:\n\n### SQL Server 2016-2022 & SQL Server 2025 (Generally Available)\n\nNative mirroring for SQL Server (Generally Available), including versions 2016–2022 and SQL Server 2025. This capability securely replicates operational data into OneLake in an analytics-ready format, converting it to Delta tables for downstream scenarios like BI, data science, and engineering.\n\nEach mirrored database automatically provides a SQL analytics endpoint, enabling familiar T-SQL queries on read-only copies without ETL overhead. Supported environments include on-premises, Azure VMs, and non-Azure clouds, with secure connectivity via on-premises data gateway.\n\nTo learn more about [Mirroring SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/sql-server), refer to the documentation our [check out the in-depth blog post](https://aka.ms/sqlmirroringblog).\n\n> >\n> “With Fabric Mirroring in SQL Server 2025, ExponentHR can effortlessly mirror numerous datasets to fabric, enabling near real-time analytics. This technology has alleviated the need for expensive and complex ETL operations and enables more productivity for our customers. Thanks to SQL Server 2025’s built-in cloud connectivity, we can directly process large amounts of data efficiently and overcome traditional bottlenecks.”\n> >\n> Brent Carlson, IT Manager, ExponentHR\n\n### Snowflake Mirroring for Iceberg Tables (Generally Available)\n\nSnowflake Mirroring now supports for Apache Iceberg tables in addition to managed tables****enabling organizations to bring external Iceberg datasets into****OneLake without heavy overhead.  This enhancement to Snowflake Mirroring uses **s**hortcut-based mirroring to provide read-through access to Iceberg tables hosted across diverse storage systems such as ADLS Gen2, AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and S3-compatible services. You can now view your mirrored managed tables and Iceberg tables in one place and unlock high-performance and AI-ready analytics, open format interoperability, and **cost** efficiency**.**\n\nTo learn more, and a free trial, refer to the [Tutorial: Configure Microsoft Fabric mirrored databases from Snowflake](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/snowflake-tutorial) documentation.\n\n### Azure PostgreSQL (Generally Available)\n\nMirroring for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (Generally Available), enables continuous replication of transactional data into OneLake without manual ETL. Mirrored PostgreSQL databases are converted into Delta table**s**, making them analytics-ready for BI, machine learning, and data engineering workloads.\n\nThis feature ensures near real-time synchronization, supports schema evolution, and provides a SQL analytics endpoint for querying mirrored data using familiar T-SQL syntax. It’s ideal for scenarios like customer analytics, inventory optimization, and real-time reporting.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Mirroring Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/azure-database-postgresql) documentation.\n\nAzure Cosmos DB (Generally Available)\n\nCosmos DB Mirroring (Generally Available) brings globally distributed NoSQL data into OneLake for unified analytics. This GA release supports continuous change capture, converting mirrored containers into Delta tables for downstream analytics while maintaining Cosmos DB’s multi-model flexibility.\n\nKey enterprise features include automatic schema inference and support for nested JSON. Use cases span real-time personalization, fraud detection, and IoT telemetry analysis at scale.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Mirroring Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/azure-cosmos-db) documentation or [check out our in-depth blog post](https://aka.ms/cosmos-fabric-ga-blog).\n\n### Qlik joins the Mirroring Partner Ecosystem\n\n[Qlik’s Open Mirroring integration](https://www.qlik.com/blog/qlik-microsoft-fabric-open-mirroring-the-fast-track-to-real-time-data) covers over 40 different sources including SAP and DB2 just to name a few. This integration automates and simplifies the extraction and streaming of operational data directly into OneLake. The result is a unified data estate and near real-time data freshness that eliminates complex ETL pipelines, minimizes source system impact, and delivers instant, reliable insights for analytics, data science, and AI use cases, all while reducing manual configuration and maintenance overhead. Eastman has already seen significant efficiencies with mirroring from their SAP Application DB on Oracle systems.\n\n> >\n> “*Qlik Replicate’s Open Mirroring integration has* dramatically reduced end-to-end latency f*rom over 10 minutes to under one minute and moved us from daily operational interventions to sustained, long-term stability. This combination has transformed our ability to deliver real-time insights to Microsoft Fabric targets with the reliability and performance our teams require*.”\n> >\n> Ben Hobbs, Senior Data Architecture Administrator at Eastman\n\n## Why this changes the game\n\n- **Accelerated insights** with zero ETL.\n- **Simplified governance** under OneLake.\n- **Reduced cost and complexity** across hybrid and multi-cloud environments\n\n## What’s Next\n\nExpect more connectors, performance optimizations, and deeper integrations in the months ahead.
