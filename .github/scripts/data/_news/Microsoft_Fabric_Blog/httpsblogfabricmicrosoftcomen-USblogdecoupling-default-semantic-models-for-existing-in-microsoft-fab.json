  "EnhancedContent": "In our earlier announcement, we shared that newly created data warehouses, lakehouses and other items in Microsoft Fabric would no longer automatically generate default semantic models. This change allows customers to have more control over their modeling experience and to explicitly choose when and how to create semantic models.\n\nAs a follow-up, we’re now decoupling existing default semantic models that were previously auto-generated for items created before this change. These default models have been migrated to standalone semantic models, giving you full ownership and flexibility to manage them independently.\n\n## What’s Changing\n\n- Default semantic models that were automatically associated with existing warehouses and lakehouses are now decoupled.\n- These models continue to exist in your workspace as independent semantic model items.\n- This means you can retain them if you still use them for reports or dashboards or delete them safely if they are no longer needed.\n\n## Identify and Delete decoupled Semantic Models\n\nThe script below demonstrates how to use the Fabric API to retrieve all decoupled default semantic models in a workspace and delete the ones that are empty.\n\nYou’ll need:\n\nA valid Fabric access token\n\nThe workspace ID\n\n``` import requests\n\nworkspace_id = \"\" migratedsemanticmodels_url = f\"https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{workspace_id}/datawarehouses/migratedSemanticModels\"\n\npayload = \"\" headers = { \"User-Agent\": \"delete-default-semantic-models-script/1.0\", \"Authorization\": \"Bearer {token}\" }\n\nresponse = requests.request(\"GET\", migratedsemanticmodels_url, headers=headers) response.raise_for_status()\n\nmodels = response.json().get(\"value\", []) print(f\"Found {len(models)} semantic models.\")\n\nfor model in models: model_id = model.get(\"modelObjectId\") is_empty = model.get(\"isEmpty\") delete_url = f\"https://dailyapi.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/semanticModels/{model_id}\" if is_empty: print(f\"Would delete (empty): ({model_id}) - URL: {delete_url}\") delete_response = requests.delete(delete_url, headers=headers) if delete_response.status_code == 200: print(f\"Deleted: ({model_id})\") elif delete_response.status_code == 404: print(f\"Not found or already deleted: ({model_id})\") else: print(f\"Failed to delete ({model_id}): {delete_response.status_code}\") else: print(f\"Skipping non-empty model: ({model_id})\") ```\n\n## How it Works\n\n- Retrieves decoupled default semantic models for a given workspace.\n- Checks whether each model is empty.\n- Deletes empty models while skipping those that contain objects.\n\nAPI References – [Items – Delete Semantic Model – REST API (Semantic Model)](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/semanticmodel/items/delete-semantic-model?tabs=HTTP)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe decoupling of default semantic models marks another step toward a more modular and transparent data modeling experience in Microsoft Fabric. By providing explicit control over semantic model lifecycle, you can now better manage, optimize, or remove unused models — keeping your workspace clean, consistent, and efficient.",
