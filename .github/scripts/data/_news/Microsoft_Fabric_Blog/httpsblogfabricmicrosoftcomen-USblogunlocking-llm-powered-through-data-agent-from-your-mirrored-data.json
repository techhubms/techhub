This is where mirroring in Fabric comes in. With open mirroring, you can bring data from Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) directly into Fabric’s Delta Parquet format, ensuring it stays automatically in sync with the source. Now, with mirrored database artifacts connected directly to data agents in Fabric, you can unlock the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to query, reason over, and generate insights from your operational data–accelerating time-to-insight across your entire data estate.\n\n## **What Are Mirrored Database Artifacts?**\n\nMirrored database artifacts are representations of your external databases—such as Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, Oracle, Snowflake, Databricks—mirrored into Microsoft Fabric. This enables you to leverage Fabric’s AI-driven analytics and LLM capabilities over data that previously lived outside the Fabric ecosystem.\n\n### **Supported Mirrored Artifacts in Data Agent include:**\n\n- Mirrored Azure Cosmos DB\n- Mirrored Azure Database for PostgreSQL\n- Mirrored Azure Databricks catalog\n- Mirrored Azure SQL Database\n- Mirrored Azure SQL Managed Instance\n- Mirrored Oracle\n- Mirrored Snowflake\n- Mirrored SQL Server Database\n\nWith the latest release, users can add mirrored artifacts directly to Fabric Data Agent. Users no longer need to create an intermediary Lakehouse to bridge this gap. Once connected, the data agent leverages its NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL) capability to generate and execute SQL queries against the SQL Analytics Endpoint built into the mirrored artifact. This means users can ask natural language questions and get instant, actionable insights—powered by LLMs—across all your mirrored data sources.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AddMirroredDBBlog-1024x576.gif)Figure 1: The user has a data agent loaded with a mirrored databricks catalog and a mirrored oracle database. The user hits on add datasource and filters by mirrored items in Fabric. The user then selects a mirrored cosmos db and adds it to the data agent.\n\n### **Key Features and Benefits**\n\nBy connecting mirrored artifacts directly–without extra steps–you can unlock instant insights, streamline workflows, and power smarter applications across your data estate.\n\n- Direct Integration: Add mirrored artifacts as data sources in Fabric data agents without the need for intermediate Lakehouses or shortcuts.\n- AI-Driven Analytics: Use data agent’s built-in NL2SQL to query your data in plain English and receive insights instantly.\n- Broad Compatibility: Integrate data from Azure, Oracle, Snowflake, Databricks, and more.\n- Customizable Knowledge: Curate the data agent with instructions, data source instructions, and few-shot queries for all mirrored data sources.\n- Scoped Context: Select relevant tables to focus the data agent’s knowledge and responses.\n- Seamless AI Application: Bridge the gap between your external data and AI applications in Microsoft Fabric.\n\n### **Getting Started**\n\n1. Mirror Your Database: Use mirroring for Azure databases, or open mirroring to bring external databases into Microsoft Fabric as a mirrored artifact.\n2. Add to Data Agent: In the data agent interface, add the mirrored artifact as a data source.\n3. Curate and Query: Customize your data agent with instructions and examples, then start asking questions in natural language to generate LLM-powered insights.\n\n### **What’s Next?**\n\nMicrosoft Fabric is continuing to expand support for additional data sources. Coming soon, you’ll be able to connect SQL Database artifacts.\n\nTo learn more about data agent, check out the [Fabric data agent concepts (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/concept-data-agent) documentation.\n\nFor more details on how to mirror your databases into Fabric, review the [Open Mirroring](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/database/mirrored-database/open-mirroring) documentation.\n\n### **Summary**\n\nBy connecting mirrored database artifacts directly to Fabric Data Agent, you can unlock the full power of LLM-driven analytics across all your data—no matter where it lives. This new capability makes it easier than ever to bridge the gap between your data and AI, empowering you to make smarter, faster decisions.",
