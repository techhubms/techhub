  "EnhancedContent": "Copy Job has become the go-to solution in Microsoft Fabric Data Factory for simplified data movement, whether you’re moving data across clouds, from on-premises systems, or between services. With native support for multiple delivery styles, including bulk copy, incremental copy, and change data capture (CDC) replication, Copy Job offers the flexibility to handle a wide range of scenarios—all through an intuitive, easy-to-use experience.\n\nAnd we’re not stopping there! Based on your feedback, we’ve continued to refine Copy Job to make it smarter, faster, and even more powerful. In this update, we’re thrilled to introduce several exciting enhancements that will simplify your workflows and supercharge your efficiency.\n\n**Reset Incremental Copy**\n\nIncremental copy is one of the most loved features in Copy job. It dramatically boosts efficiency by transferring only new or updated data, saving you time, resources and manual effort. The process is simple: the first run performs a full data load, and every run after that moves just the changes.\n\nNow you have greater flexibility in managing incremental copy, including the ability to reset it back to a full copy on the next run. This is incredibly useful when there’s a data discrepancy between your source and destination—you can simply let Copy Job perform a full copy in the next run to resolve the issue, then continue with incremental updates afterward.\n\nEven better, you can reset incremental copy per table, giving you fine-grained control. For example, you can re-copy smaller tables without impacting larger ones. This means smarter troubleshooting, less disruption, and more efficient data movement.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-63-1024x415.png)\n\n**Auto Table Creation on Destination**\n\nWe’re on a mission to eliminate every friction point and make your data movement experience as smooth and intuitive as possible. Auto Table Creation is one of the steps in that direction. If the specified table doesn’t exist at your destination, Copy Job will automatically create the table and its schema for you. No manual setup, no interruptions, just effortless data movement from start to finish.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-11-1024x606.png)\n\nCopy Job can now automatically create tables on the following destination stores:\n\n- SQL Server\n\n- Azure SQL database\n\n- Fabric Lakehouse table\n\n- Snowflake\n\n- Azure SQL Managed Instance\n\n- Fabric SQL database\n\n**JSON format support**\n\nCopy job is the tool for you to move data from any source to any destination in any format. You can always perform high-throughput binary copy between storage locations for any file format. You can also copy files like CSV or Parquet to and from tables—and now, the same capability is available for JSON file formats.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-68-1024x606.png)\n\n**A Final Touch of Delight: Quick Access to Connection Details**\n\nAt last, we want to share another improvement inspired by your feedback! You can now easily view your connection details—such as service name and workspace name—right from the Copy Job panel. Simply hover over your connection on either the source or destination store, and the details appear instantly.\n\nIt’s a small change, but a big time-saver that makes your Copy Job experience even smoother and more intuitive.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-67-1024x138.png)\n\n## **Additional Resources**\n\nTo learn more, explore our [Microsoft Fabric Copy Job Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/what-is-copy-job).\n\nSubmit your feedback on [Fabric Ideas](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-Ideas/idb-p/fbc_ideas/label-name/data%20factory%20%7C%20copy%20job) and join the conversation on [the Fabric Community](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Copy-job/bd-p/db_copyjob).\n\nTo get into the technical details, head over to the [Fabric documentation](https://aka.ms/FabricBlog/docs).\n\n**Have any questions or feedback?
