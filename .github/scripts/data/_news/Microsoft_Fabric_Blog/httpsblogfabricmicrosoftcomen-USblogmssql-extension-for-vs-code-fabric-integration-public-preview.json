  "EnhancedContent": "The [MSSQL Extension for VS Code](http://aka.ms/vscode-mssql) continues to evolve, delivering features that make SQL development more integrated, more consistent, and more developer friendly. In version v1.36.0, Fabric Connectivity (Browse) and SQL Database in Fabric Provisioning — two capabilities that bring Microsoft Fabric directly into your local development workflow inside Visual Studio Code.\n\n## Fabric Connectivity (Preview)\n\nThe MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code now includes Fabric connectivity, making it easier than ever to browse and connect to your Fabric workspaces directly from your development environment. This new integration eliminates the friction of connection strings and brings Fabric resources into the familiar VS Code experience.\n\nWith this update, you can authenticate once, browse all your workspaces in an intuitive tree view, and establish connections to your Fabric resources in just a few clicks—all without leaving VS Code.\n\n### **Key highlights**\n\n- Dedicated Fabric Experience: A new Fabric connection type joins the existing Parameters and Azure options in the connection dialog, providing a purpose-built interface for Fabric users.\n- Seamless Authentication: Leverage Microsoft Entra ID for secure, one-click authentication with persistent sign-in that remembers your credentials across sessions.\n- Intelligent Workspace Browsing: Explore all your Fabric workspaces in an intuitive view that loads all your resources on-demand for optimal performance.\n- Smart Search & Discovery: Find workspaces quickly with real-time search that brings the most relevant results to the top.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fabric-connectivity-1024x649.png)Fabric browse experience in the MSSQL extension for VS Code\n\n## SQL database in Fabric Provisioning (Preview**)**\n\nWith Fabric Provisioning, you can now create SQL databases in Fabric without leaving VS Code. The new provisioning flow allows you to authenticate, select or create a workspace, name your database, and connect instantly—all in under three minutes.\n\nBy bringing provisioning directly into the Deployments page, this experience eliminates the need to use the Fabric Portal or Azure Portal, reducing context switching and making early prototyping significantly faster.\n\n### Key highlights\n\n- Simple Provisioning Flow: Authenticate, select or create a workspace, name your database, and create.\n- Immediate Connection: The new database is automatically added to your connections for instant querying.\n- Consistent Experience: Provisioning flow aligns with other backend options, like local SQL Server containers.\n- Capacity Awareness: Disabled workspaces are clearly shown with guidance if capacity isn’t available.\n\n![Fabric provisioning animated demo](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fabric-provisioning.gif)SQL database in Fabric provisioning experience in the MSSQL extension for VS Code\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy making it simple to connect to Fabric resources and provision databases directly from VS Code, the MSSQL extension continues to simplify the way developers build and manage modern applications. Combined with ongoing performance, usability, and reliability improvements, this update further positions the extension as the easiest way to get started with SQL Server, Azure SQL, and now Fabric, all without leaving your editor.\n\nIf there’s something you’d love to see in a future update, here’s how you can contribute:\n\n- [GitHub discussions](https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-discussions) – Share your ideas and suggestions to improve the extension.\n- [New feature requests](https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-feature-request) – Request missing capabilities and help shape future updates.\n- [Report bugs](https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-bug) – Help us track down and fix issues to make the extension more reliable.\n\n- [Fabric Connectivity (Browse) demo](https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-fabric-browse-demo)\n- [SQL database in Fabric provisioning demo](https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-fabric-db-demo)\n- [Full playlist of demos](https://aka.ms/vscode-mssql-demos)\n\nThanks for being part of the journey—happy coding!",
