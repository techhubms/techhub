  "EnhancedContent": "SQL Pool Insights is a powerful new monitoring capability in Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse designed to give you actionable insights into SQL pool performance and resource utilization. This feature is part of the Query Insights (QI) schema, extending the monitoring experience customers already know and love.\n\nSQL Pool Insights addresses a long-standing customer need: understanding whether your pools are under pressure and how configuration changes impact workloads. With SQL Pool Insights, you can now track resource allocation, monitor pressure events, and correlate performance trends — all within the Query Insights framework.\n\n## Why SQL Pool Insights Matters\n\nModern analytics workloads demand transparency and control. Until now, customers had limited visibility into how their out-of-the-box pools (SELECT and NON SELECT) behaved under varying conditions. **Query Insights** already provides historical query execution data and performance metrics.\n\n### **SQL Pool Insights complements this by adding pool-level telemetry**\n\n- **Real-time monitoring** of pool health and pressure states.\n- **Historical data** for configuration changes and capacity adjustments.\n- **Event-based logging** for pressure periods lasting more than one minute.\n- **Resource isolation validation** between SELECT and NON SELECT pools.\n\nMeaning faster troubleshooting, better capacity planning, and improved performance for your most critical queries.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\n- **OOTB Pool Coverage (Coming Soon):** Monitor SELECT and NON SELECT pools today, with support for custom pools.\n- **Schema Details:** Access fields like `sql_pool_name`\n, `timestamp` , `max_resource_percentage` , and `is_pool_under_pressure` for granular analysis.\n- **Correlate Performance Issues:** Combine insights from SQL Pool Insights with other Query Insights views (e.g., `exec_requests_history`\n, `long_running_queries` ) for a complete picture of query execution and resource usage.\n\n## How it Works\n\nSQL Pool Insights introduces a new system view in [Query Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/query-insights):\n\n``` SELECT * FROM queryinsights.sql_pool_insights; ```\n\nThis view logs events whenever:\n\n- Pool configuration changes.\n- Workspace capacity SKU changes.\n- Pressure state changes persist for at least one minute.\n\n## Example Scenarios\n\n### Identify Pressure Periods:\n\n``` SELECT sql_pool_name, timestamp, is_pool_under_pressure FROM queryinsights.sql_pool_insights WHERE sql_pool_name = 'SELECT' AND timestamp >= DATEADD(hour, -24, GETDATE()) AND is_pool_under_pressure = 1 ORDER BY timestamp DESC; ```\n\n### Visualize Pressure Trends:\n\n``` SELECT sql_pool_name, timestamp, is_pool_under_pressure, LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY sql_pool_name ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_event, DATEDIFF(minute, LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY sql_pool_name ORDER BY timestamp), timestamp) AS minutes_since_last_event FROM queryinsights.sql_pool_insights WHERE sql_pool_name = 'SELECT' ORDER BY timestamp; ```\n\n### Correlate Pressure Window with Queries using *queryinsights.exec\\_requests\\_history*\n\n``` WITH Pool_Pressure_Events AS ( SELECT DISTINCT timestamp FROM queryinsights.sql_pool_insights WHERE is_pool_under_pressure = 1 ) SELECT * FROM queryinsights.exec_requests_history AS erh JOIN Pool_Pressure_Events AS ppe ON ppe.timestamp BETWEEN erh.start_time AND erh.end_time ```\n\n## When to Use SQL Pool Insights\n\n- Investigate performance bottlenecks.\n- Validate resource isolation between workloads.\n- Plan capacity changes based on historical trends.\n- Troubleshoot slow-running queries by correlating pressure events with `queryinsights.exec_requests_history`\n.\n\n## Learn More\n\nExplore the full documentation and start using SQL Pool Insights.
