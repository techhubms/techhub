Organizations now need to sense what is happening across their business the moment it occurs, understand its significance, and respond with confidence. Real-time data has become the foundation for how resilient, competitive organizations run. Enterprises also realize that fragmented data stacks cannot support modern AI or operational agility.\n\nMicrosoft anticipated this shift early on. We invested heavily in real-time services in Azure, including Event Hubs, Stream Analytics, and Data Explorer, powering mission-critical real-time workloads for years for both Microsoft and our customers and delivering proven reliability, performance, and planet scale.\n\nBut the decisive step was building Real-Time Intelligence into Microsoft Fabric on top of that mature foundation in Azure. Real-Time Intelligence unifies streaming, analytics, and action in one governed platform, bringing batch and streaming together in OneLake and Fabric.\n\nMicrosoft has been recognized as a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: Streaming Data Platforms, Q4 2025, which we view as a strong validation of our strategy and execution. This position as a leader is the result of our long-term conviction rather than short-term reaction. Microsoft invested early so organizations would have a mature, scalable real-time foundation exactly when the need became urgent, and that foresight is now paying off for customers.\n\n![A blue and white diagram AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a-blue-and-white-diagram-ai-generated-content-may.png)Forrester Wave Streaming Data Platforms, Q4 2025\n\n## A Leader for the Real-Time Enterprise\n\nForrester’s 2025 evaluation confirms a clear market shift: enterprises are moving away from fragmented real-time architectures and toward unified platforms that can support AI-driven decisions at digital speed. As Forrester notes, “AI agents rely on seamless data flow across ingestion, transformation, and real-time insights to avoid bottlenecks and cascading errors. A robust platform unifies these workloads (messaging, processing, analytics), eliminating silos and latency that degrade decision quality.” In this environment, a fully integrated streaming platform has become essential rather than optional.\n\nThis is exactly where Real-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric stands out. Forrester notes that Microsoft’s strategy is to bring dozens of services together under a single umbrella, making real-time development and event-driven analytics “second nature” within Fabric. Real-time data becomes a first-class citizen in Fabric’s unified data estate. Streaming signals land directly into OneLake, the same foundation that powers the lakehouse, warehouse, semantic models, governance, Power BI, and AI agents.\n\nForrester’s assessment is clear: “Microsoft excels at messaging, analytics, governance, developer experience, business user experience, and more, enabling robust performance for real-time analytics and event-driven applications. It provides seamless integration within the Fabric ecosystem to support enterprise use cases like predictive analytics and operational dashboards. It offers strong tooling for both technical and business users as well as deep integration with Azure services, empowering enterprises to build real-time solutions.”\n\nThis recognition reflects a platform designed from the start to work as one coherent system, not a set of loosely assembled services. It is an end-to-end real-time platform that strengthens the entire data estate and positions organizations to run AI-driven operations with clarity, speed, and confidence.\n\n### Why Enterprises Are Standardizing on Fabric Real-Time Intelligence\n\nReal-Time Intelligence delivers a complete end-to-end platform for understanding and acting on what is happening across the enterprise in the moment. It unifies signals across time, space, and relationships to provide a connected operational picture rather than isolated dashboards or fragmented telemetry. Every stage of the real-time lifecycle (streaming, analyzing, modeling, visualizing, and acting) is integrated into one governed, AI-ready system. This coherence is what enables teams and AI agents to work from one live, trusted view of the business and make high-quality decisions at digital speed.\n\nThe **Real-Time Hub** is the unified experience that makes every enterprise signal visible, governed, and ready for use. It brings all the capabilities of Real-Time Intelligence together into a coherent operational fabric, the live nervous system of the modern enterprise.\n\n## Across five major areas, these capabilities form a complete real-time platform:\n\n- **Stream:** **Eventstream** ingests, shapes, filters, and enriches data in motion, while **Connectors** pulls data from dozens of streaming sources, including Kafka, MQTT, IoT systems, SaaS apps, and CDC feeds. **Event Schema Set** standardizes events to keep signals consistent, interoperable, and easy to govern.\n- **Analyze:** Real-time and historical insights converge in **Eventhouse**, a high-performance engine for interactive analytics over petabyte-scale data. **Anomaly Detector** highlights deviations and emerging risks the moment they appear.\n- **Model:** Fabric’s modeling layer enables unified operational awareness. **Graph** links signals to entities and relationships, **Fabric Map** situates them in physical space, and **Digital Twin Builder** models assets and environments over time.\n- **Visualize:** **KQL Querysets** enable fast, interactive analytics for exploring data and diagnosing problems, **Graph Querysets** for relational and causal patterns across the business, and **Real-Time Dashboards** for intuitive, no-code views of live conditions and trends.\n- **Act:** **Activator** detects patterns over time on a per-instance basis and triggers alerts or workflows through visual no-code business rules. **Operations Agent** monitors your operations, reasons about your business, and takes automated actions based on natural language instructions.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/word-image-31926-2.gif)Fabric Real-Time Intelligence Components across Stream | Analyze | Model | Visualize | Act\n\n### How Fabric IQ Completes the Intelligence Layer\n\nWe recently introduced Fabric IQ (see [blog post](https://aka.ms/fabric-iq-blogs)), the intelligence layer that transforms unified data into unified understanding for every team and every AI agent. IQ brings a semantic, reasoning-ready foundation to the entire Fabric platform, including Real-Time Intelligence, so organizations can interpret what is happening across their business, not just observe it. It augments human and AI workflows with natural language understanding, contextual reasoning, and a unified live view drawn from both streaming and historical data.\n\nIQ enables natural-language exploration across all your data in Fabric, allowing users to ask questions, investigate anomalies, and understand relationships without writing code. It synthesizes patterns across time, space, and relationships, surfaces anomalies, explains correlations, and identifies root causes. This shift is what elevates Fabric from a data platform to an enterprise intelligence platform, one where insights are generated, connected, and immediately actionable.\n\nIQ amplifies the power of Real-Time Intelligence. Streaming events stop being isolated signals and become part of a live coherent semantic picture: operators can ask why something happened, analysts can explore emerging risks and opportunities, and AI agents can reason over business meaning before taking action. Because IQ relies on the same governance, semantics, and security as the rest of Fabric, the insights it produces are consistent, trustworthy, and grounded in the organization’s shared data estate.\n\nTogether, Real-Time Intelligence and IQ create a unified real-time decision system. Real-Time Intelligence senses what is happening in the moment; IQ interprets it and drives the next action. This seamless integration enables enterprises and their AI agents to operate with precision even as conditions change second by second.\n\n## Strategic Takeaways for Enterprise Leaders\n\nReal-time intelligence is becoming core to modern enterprise operations, no longer a specialist capability or an add-on component. AI requires up-to-date, contextualized data. Decision systems must unify batch and streaming data. And governance and semantics must extend across the entire data estate, from historical tables to real-time streams, to ensure trust, lineage, compliance, and safe AI behavior.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric, with Real-Time Intelligence and IQ, offers a decisive foundation for this new era. It brings together data, meaning, and action in one governed platform. It unifies time, space, and relationships to give enterprises a complete operational picture. And it supports AI-driven decisions at digital speed while strengthening governance, reliability, and trust.\n\nAs organizations modernize their data platforms and adopt AI at scale, Fabric provides the clarity, coherence, and confidence they need to run their business in real time and to thrive in the decade ahead.\n\n## Statement from Forrester\n\nForrester does not endorse any company, product, brand, or service included in its research publications and does not advise any person to select the products or services of any company or brand based on the ratings included in such publications.
