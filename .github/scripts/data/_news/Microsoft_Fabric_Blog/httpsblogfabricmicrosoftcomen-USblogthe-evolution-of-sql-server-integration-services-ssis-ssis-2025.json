  "EnhancedContent": "**SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)** has been a cornerstone of enterprise data integration since its introduction, enabling organizations to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data across diverse systems. Over many years, SSIS has evolved to meet the growing demands of hybrid and cloud-first architecture. The release of **SSIS 2025**, announced as generally available at Microsoft Ignite, marks a significant milestone in this journey. This version not only modernizes the platform but also aligns it with the latest SQL Server 2025 engine, bringing enhanced security and integration capabilities.\n\n## Enterprise Security in SSIS 2025\n\nSecurity is a top priority for SSIS 2025, reflecting the broader enterprise’s focus on data protection and compliance. **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient** provides a modern, secure data access layer. This new provider supports advanced security protocols, including **TLS 1.3** for encrypted connections, and integrates seamlessly with **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory) for robust authentication.\n\nAdditionally, SQL Server’s **Strict Encryption**—introduced with TDS 8.0 and further enhanced in 2025—enforces default encryption for all network traffic, including SSIS operations. These enhancements ensure that sensitive data is protected both in transit and at rest, meeting the stringent requirements of modern enterprises. Check out [What’s New in Integration Services in SQL Server 2025](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/integration-services/what-s-new-in-integration-services-in-sql-server-2025?view=sql-server-2017) to learn more.\n\n## Integration with Microsoft Fabric\n\nMicrosoft Fabric represents the next generation of analytics platforms, offering a unified SaaS solution for data warehousing, Lakehouse, and real-time analytics. While SSIS remains a powerful on-premises and Azure Data Factory (ADF) ETL tool, its integration with Fabric is evolving. SSIS packages can now target **Fabric Data Warehouse**, but require key modifications:\n\n- **Authentication:** SSIS must use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, as Fabric does not support SQL or Windows authentication. This ensures centralized, identity-based security.\n- **Data Ingestion:** The recommended approach for loading data into Fabric Data Warehouse is to use the native T-SQL COPY INTO command, replacing older fast-insert or BCP scripts. This aligns SSIS workflows with Fabric’s open, scalable architecture.\n\nRefer to [Tutorial: Integrating SSIS with Fabric Data Warehouse | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/integration-services/fabric-integration/integrate-fabric-data-warehouse?view=sql-server-ver17) for detailed instructions.\n\n## SSIS lift & shift into Fabric Data Factory\n\nSSIS lift-and-shift capabilities in Microsoft Fabric Data Factory are designed for customers who currently run SSIS packages on-premises or in Azure Data Factory and want a seamless migration path to Fabric without rewriting their ETL logic. This enables you to reuse existing SSIS investments while modernizing your data integration strategy with Fabric’s unified analytics platform. Now you can use your existing SSIS packages inside of your Fabric workspace and enjoy the benefits of data consolidation with OneLake, Copilot with Data Factory, and many other new modern benefits of Fabric.\n\nTo join the early access and help shape the future of SSIS in Fabric, submit your [Sign Up Form](https://aka.ms/FabricSSIS) to join our private preview today.\n\n![Screenshot of SSIS in Fabric Data Factory (Private Preview)](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/screenshot-of-ssis-in-fabric-data-factory-private-1.png)\n\nFigure SSIS in Fabric Private Preview Form\n\n## Modernization to Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric\n\n**Microsoft Connector for Oracle** and **Change Data Capture (CDC) components** are moved out of SQL Server 2025 Integration Services. While this presents an opportunity to explore new solutions for modern data integration with Oracle.\n\n### Exploring best-in-class connectivity to Oracle with Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric\n\n[Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/data-factory-overview) offers modern data integration experience with Oracle databases, allowing reading from Oracle databases on-premises or behind a virtual network, and writing to any data destination.\n\nOne of the powerful features of Data Factory is its ability to configure and manage Oracle database connections in a copy activity or a Copy job. This functionality allows organizations to seamlessly integrate their Oracle databases into their data pipelines, ensuring efficient data movement and transformation. [Configure Oracle database](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-oracle-database-copy-activity) in a copy activity provides comprehensive instructions on how to perform this configuration.\n\nYou can leverage the on-premises data gateway to securely connect to your on-premises Oracle database. This gateway acts as a bridge, enabling seamless data movement between on-premises data sources and cloud services. For detailed instructions, please refer to [move data from Oracle to Fabric Lakehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/tutorial-move-data-from-oracle-to-lakehouse-pipeline) via pipeline and on-premises data gateway.\n\n### Native Change Data Capture with Fabric Copy Job\n\n**Change data capture (CDC) in Copy job** is a powerful capability in Fabric Data Factory that enables efficient and automated replication of changed data including inserted, updated, and deleted records from a source to a destination. This ensures your destination data stays up to date without manual effort, improving efficiency in data integration while reducing the load on your source system.\n\nFabric Copy job CDC enables efficient, automated replication of changed data—including inserts, updates, and deletes—from Oracle and other sources to destinations like Fabric Lakehouse or Data Warehouse. Key benefits include:\n\n- **Zero manual intervention:** Incremental changes are captured and replicated automatically.\n- **Optimized performance:** Only changed data is processed, reducing load and latency.\n- **Flexible integration:** Supports both CDC-enabled and non-CDC sources, with options for watermark-based incremental copy.\n\nIf you have interest to try Oracle CDC under Private Preview in Copy job, please feel free to submit your request [Copy Job Sign Up Form.](http://aka.ms/CopyJobCDCSignUp)\n\n## Learn more\n\n- [SQL Server Integration Services 2025 General Availability | Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/ssis/sql-server-integration-services-2025-general-availability/4471157)\n- [Tutorial: Integrating SSIS with Fabric Data Warehouse | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/integration-services/fabric-integration/integrate-fabric-data-warehouse?view=sql-server-ver17)\n- [Oracle database connector overview – Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-oracle-database-overview)\n- [Move data from Oracle to Fabric Lakehouse via pipeline and on-premises data gateway – Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/tutorial-move-data-from-oracle-to-lakehouse-pipeline)\n- [Expanded CDC Support for More Sources & Destinations – Simplifying Data Ingestion with Copy job | Microsoft Fabric Blog | Microsoft Fabric](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/simplifying-data-ingestion-with-copy-job-expanded-cdc-support-for-more-sources-destinations?ft=Data-factory:category)",
