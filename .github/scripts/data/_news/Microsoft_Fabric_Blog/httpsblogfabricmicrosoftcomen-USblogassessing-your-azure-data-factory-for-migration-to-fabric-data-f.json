  "EnhancedContent": "As organizations modernize their data integration workflows, moving from Azure Data Factory (ADF) to Fabric Data Factory is an important milestone. Before starting the migration, it’s crucial to determine which pipelines and activities are ready to move, which require modifications, and which are not yet supported in Fabric. The built-in migration assessment tool in ADF streamlines this evaluation.\n\n## Why perform a migration Assessment?\n\nMigration involves more than transferring resources. It ensures compatibility and minimizes disruption. Use the assessment tool to:\n\n- Identify pipelines and activities ready for migration.\n- Flag items that need changes or aren’t currently supported.\n- Export a comprehensive report for planning and tracking.\n\n## How to Run the Assessment\n\n- Open your Azure Data Factory instance in the Azure portal.\n- Select the Start assessment (preview) in the authoring canvas toolbar.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/word-image-31991-1.png)Figure 1: Start assessment\n\nReview the side pane listing of your pipelines and the activities within. Expand each pipeline for more details.\n\n![Screenshot showing assessment summary on the side panel](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/screenshot-showing-assessment-summary-on-the-side-1.png)Figure 2: View assessment summary\n\n- Select Export to download a CSV report with pipeline and activity statuses. ![Screenshot showing the drilldownn of assessment along with export option](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/screenshot-showing-the-drilldownn-of-assessment-al-1.png)\n\nFigure: View assessment summary drill-down\n\n## Understanding Assessment Results\n\nEach pipeline and activity will be tagged with one of four statuses:\n\n- Ready: For migration.\n- Needs review: Requires changes before migration (e.g., parameters).\n- Coming soon: Support in progress; migrate later (e.g., dataflows).\n- Not compatible: No equivalent in Fabric; refactor required.\n\nNote: The overall pipeline status will reflect the most restrictive status among its activities—if there are activities tagged as “Needs review,” “Coming soon,” or “Not compatible,” the pipeline will inherit “Not compatible” as the pipeline status to ensure migration readiness is accurately represented.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWhile we are building a native UX based migration experience you may:\n\n- Use [PowerShell upgrade tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/migrate-pipelines-powershell-upgrade-module-for-azure-data-factory-to-fabric) for early migration.\n- Plan remediation for items flagged as “Needs review” or “Not compatible.”\n- Refer to [Migration planning guides](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/migrate-from-azure-data-factory) and [migration best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/migration-best-practices).\n- Stay tuned for updates as Fabric Data Factory expands its supported features.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [How to assess your Azure Data Factory to Fabric Data Factory Migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/how-to-assess-your-azure-data-factory-to-fabric-data-factory-migration)\n- [Data Factory documentation in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/)\n- [Connector capability comparison between Azure Data Factory and Data Factory in Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-parity)",
