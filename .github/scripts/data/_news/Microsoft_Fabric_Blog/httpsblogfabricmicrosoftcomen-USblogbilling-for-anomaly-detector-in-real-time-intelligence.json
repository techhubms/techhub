  "EnhancedContent": "We have an important update for customers using Anomaly Detector in Microsoft Fabric’s Real-Time Intelligence (RTI). This feature, currently in Preview, helps you spot unusual patterns in streaming data from Eventhouse tables—without the need for complex data science tools. It’s designed to make anomaly detection simple, fast, and accessible.\n\n## What does billing entail?\n\nStarting in December, Anomaly Detector usage will begin accruing charges. To make billing clear and straightforward, we’ve introduced a single dedicated meter:\n\n- **Meter Name:** *Anomaly Detector Queries Capacity Usage CU*\n- **Operation Name:** *Anomaly Detection Run Queries*\n\nThis meter captures all Capacity Unit (CU) consumption for anomaly detection, whether you’re running interactive analyses or monitoring data continuously in the background.\n\n## What Does This Mean for You?\n\nEvery time you run anomaly detection—whether analyzing historical data or keeping an eye on live streams—queries are executed behind the scenes. These queries are what drive CU consumption, and now you’ll see that usage reported under one unified meter. Billing is based on query execution, not the size of your data, so you can predict costs more easily.\n\nUsage details will appear in the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics app and in your Azure, billing reports, giving you full visibility into how anomaly detection impacts your capacity.\n\nLearn more about [Anomaly Detector billing](https://aka.ms/ADBillingDoc).",
