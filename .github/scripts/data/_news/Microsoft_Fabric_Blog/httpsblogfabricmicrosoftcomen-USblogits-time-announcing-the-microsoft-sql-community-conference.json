From on-premises data centers to Azure Cloud Services to Microsoft Fabric, SQL has evolved into something far more powerful than many realize and it deserves the focused attention of a big stage.\n\nThat’s why I’m thrilled to announce **SQLCon**, a dedicated conference for database developers, database administrators, and database engineers. Co-located with FabCon for an unprecedented week of deep technical content and the kind of practical knowledge-sharing that only happens when experts gather in one place.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Email-Headers-38-1024x341.png)\n\n## **Why SQLCon, Why Now?**\n\nThe SQL landscape has transformed dramatically. SQL Server 2025 represents a fundamental shift. It’s SQL reimagined for the AI era, where vector search, AI model management, and RAG patterns are built directly into the database engine. But, across the entire SQL stack, from SQL Server to Azure SQL to SQL Database in Fabric, innovation is accelerating:\n\n**AI-Ready Databases:** SQL Server 2025 and Azure SQL now offer enterprise-ready vector database capabilities with native vector storage and DiskANN-powered indexing for semantic search. Extensible model management gives you flexibility to choose the right AI model, whether Azure OpenAI, Ollama, or anywhere in between, and use it securely with support for Microsoft Entra managed identities.\n\n**AI-Powered Development:** Copilot integration transforms how we work with SQL at every layer. In Azure SQL Database, use natural language to generate T-SQL queries and troubleshoot performance. In SQL Server Management Studio 22 preview, GitHub Copilot provides real-time suggestions and best practices as you code. This is AI assistance that understands your database context.\n\n**Modern Developer Features:** Both SQL Server 2025 and Azure SQL Database deliver capabilities developers have been requesting such as native JSON data type support, regular expression functionality, REST API support, and Change Event Streaming. These essential building blocks bring SQL into parity with contemporary platforms.\n\n**SQL in Fabric’s Revolutionary Integration:** SQL Database in Fabric lets you deploy a database in seconds with GraphQL APIs (now GA) and CI/CD built in. With database mirroring, including support for Azure SQL Database and Managed Instance, and SQL Server versions 2016 through 2025 in Fabric, your data seamlessly flows into analytics and AI workflows in near real-time.\n\n**Hybrid Excellence:** SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc transforms hybrid data management by bringing Azure innovation to on-premises instances such as unified monitoring, automated updates, secure backups, and advanced high availability disaster recovery, all without leaving your datacenter.\n\nThe breadth and depth of these capabilities demand more than a few breakout sessions. Database professionals need dedicated time to go deep to master vector indexing strategies, architect hybrid solutions, troubleshoot complex scenarios, and learn directly from the people building these technologies.\n\n## **Two Conferences, One Powerful Week**\n\nCo-location with FabCon creates an opportunity to design your perfect learning path. Master SQL Server 2025’s vector indexing and AI model management, then pivot to building scalable solutions with Fabric’s Real-Time Intelligence. Attend keynotes covering the roadmap and innovations in SQL Server, Azure SQL Database and SQL database in Fabric.\n\n**You get access to both conferences with one pass.** 50 deep-dive SQL sessions, 4 full-day workshops, inspiring keynotes, plus the entire FabCon catalog. This is where database professionals troubleshoot production challenges with peers, learn cutting-edge security features, and see the complete SQL and Fabric roadmap from ground to cloud to Fabric.\n\n## **Join Us**\n\nThe SQL community has always been about practitioners helping practitioners. SQLCon embodies that spirit while giving us the space to go as deep as we need to go.\n\n[**Call for content**](https://aka.ms/sqlcon-cfc)**closes November 20** **th**, so get your submissions in now.\n\nThis is where the SQL community comes together to push the boundaries of what’s possible. I can’t wait to see you there.\n\n**Early access registration extended through November 14th.** Use code **SQLCMTY200** for $200 off. This is your best opportunity to lock in full access to both SQLCon and FabCon.\n\n[**Register Now**](https://aka.ms/sqlcon)",
