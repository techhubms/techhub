These events are smoothed and emitted every 30 seconds.\n- **Capacity State:** These focus on the current state of the capacity (e.g., is it paused or is it overloaded due to throttling) and are emitted as events occur.\n\nAs part of this, there has been a community effort to build an accelerator that has out of the box templates, configurations, and other goodness to reduce time-to-value and maximize the impact of these features.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the following [GitHub repo](https://aka.ms/fabric-capacity-events-accelerator).\n\n![A screenshot from a real-time dashboard from the accelerator showing the current and future consumption of the capacity](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-39.png)A real-time dashboard using the accelerator and capacity overview events\n\n## Example scenarios\n\nWith access to real-time capacity information through capacity overview events in Real-Time Hub, customers can monitor capacities and respond appropriately to events. This can be accomplished by utilizing Activator to take action or by leveraging Eventstream and Eventhouse to consume and process the data.\n\n![Architecture diagram illustrating options on how to consume Capacity Events](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-52.png)Architecture options on how to consume Capacity Event\n\nFor instance, consider the following scenario:\n\n*‘As a Capacity Administrator, I would like to receive a notification in Teams if the interactive delay capacity percentage approaches 95%*‘.\n\nTo implement this, users can simply navigate to the Real-Time Hub and configure an Activator to listen for events where the property ‘interactiveDelayThresholdPercentage’ exceeds 95. When this threshold is reached, the system will automatically send a message to the designated team.\n\n![Screenshot of the add rule panel for Activator to add an event-based rule](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-54.png)Adding a rule with Activator\n\nLet’s consider another scenario:\n\n*‘As a Capacity Administrator, I want to extract, perform complex operations on, and store all events occurring within my capacity, while maintaining a comprehensive history of these events*‘.\n\nIn this case, an Eventstream would be configured to receive data from one or more capacities, subsequently storing the information in an Eventhouse for advanced analysis or long-term retention.\n\n![Flow chart style visual of consuming capacity events with Eventstream, with Eventhouse and custom endpoint as destinations](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-42.png)Consuming events with Eventstream, with Eventhouse and custom endpoint as destinations\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFollow this [Introduction to Azure and Fabric events](https://aka.ms/tutorial-capacity-overview-events) tutorial to get started. For complete details on the schema and event details, refer to [Explore Fabric capacity overview events in Fabric Real-Time Hub](https://aka.ms/explore-capacity-overview-events) documentation.\n\n## What’s Next\n\nStay tuned for further improvements we are working on to provide you with more granular, transactional-level visibility into your capacity usage. We encourage you to share your suggestions and feedback at [Fabric Ideas](https://ideas.fabric.microsoft.com/) for the Real-Time Hub category and join the conversation on [the Fabric Community](https://aka.ms/FabricBlog/Community).",
