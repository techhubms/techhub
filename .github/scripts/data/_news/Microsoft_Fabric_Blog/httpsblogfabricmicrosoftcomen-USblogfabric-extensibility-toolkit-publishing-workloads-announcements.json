The Toolkit is designed to foster creativity and enable seamless integration of new solutions into the Fabric ecosystem.\n\nToday, we are taking the next step and provide three significant updates for organizations that want to offer their workload to the Fabric community. These updates are aimed at making it easier than ever for partners to create, validate, and publish their workloads, thereby accelerating the delivery of new capabilities and improving the overall experience for all users.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FET-Blog-HelloWorld-1024x576.gif)Fabric Extensibility Toolkit: Hello World Sample\n\n## Partner Workloads Now Available in the Workload Hub\n\nWith the introduction of the Fabric Extensibility Toolkit (FET), many partners expressed interest in providing their workloads to customers. We are excited to announce that partners now have the ability to [publish their FET workloads](https://aka.ms/fabric-extensibility-toolkit-publishing-how-to)directly to the Fabric Workload Hub. This advancement allows customers to discover, install, and use partner-developed workloads in the same streamlined way as any native Fabric workload. As a result, integration is seamless, providing customers with a unified and consistent experience across the platform.\n\n## Comprehensive Validation Documentation for Partners\n\nTo support partners in delivering high-quality workloads on Microsoft Fabric, we have [published thorough validation guidelines](https://aka.ms/fabric-extensibility-toolkit-publishing-criteria) outlining all the test cases used to assess workload compliance. This documentation serves as a cornerstone for ensuring consistency and reliability across the ecosystem.\n\n- Detailed Test Cases: The guidelines contain an exhaustive list of validation test cases, allowing partners to understand and prepare for the criteria their workloads will be evaluated against.\n- Resource Links and Best Practices: Partners will find convenient links to supplementary resources and recommended best practices, helping them optimize their solutions for Microsoft Fabric.\n- Styling and Components Guidance: Based on partner feedback, the documentation provides valuable information on styling and component standards, promoting a unified and native experience for users.\n- Attestation Template: Included is a template for the attestation document, which partners must publish and link from their workload. This attestation ensures transparency and helps customers verify the quality of the solutions they adopt.\n\nBy leveraging these resources, partners can more easily meet Fabric’s standards and deliver workloads that are both native in feel and consistent in execution, all within a shorter timeframe.\n\n## Validation Tool for Workload Testing (Preview)\n\nThe Validation Tool is designed specifically for partners to test their workloads against established validation criteria. This tool utilizes the same comprehensive set of test cases detailed in our published documentation, ensuring a unified and transparent validation process.\n\nPartners can clone the [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-extensibility-toolkit-validator) to get access to the validation too. The combination of this tool and the provided resources is aimed at making the publishing process more efficient, while also fostering customer confidence in the workloads they choose to adopt.\n\nThe alignment between our validation documentation and the new Validation Tool, both built on a unified test framework, streamlines preparation for partners and clarifies requirements for customers. This consistency drives higher quality and faster innovation throughout the Fabric ecosystem.\n\nWe encourage partners to explore the documentation and sign up for the private preview of the Validation Tool today to ensure your workloads meet the highest standards and earn customer trust. Start now to accelerate your publishing process and contribute to a more robust Fabric experience for everyone.",
