  "EnhancedContent": "Fabric Activator is a powerful no-code solution designed for rapid event detection and response. It continuously monitors data sources for patterns or conditions and instantly triggers the right actions—keeping workflows fast and seamless. With[Fabric Activator,](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-introduction) you can automatically execute actions or send alerts whenever specific data conditions are met, ensuring timely and efficient operations.\n\n## What’s New?\n\n1. You can now automate business logic by running [User data functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-overview) (Preview\\*) and [Spark job definition](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/spark-job-definition) as an action when your data changes.\n2. Access advanced actions for automation in [Real-time hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-hub/set-alerts-data-streams?context=%2Ffabric%2Fcontext%2Fcontext-rti&amp;pivots=fabric) (coming soon in [Real-time dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-get-data-real-time-dashboard), Eventhouse, and [KQL Queryset](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-alert-queryset?tabs=visualization)), including:\n- Pass [parameter values](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-trigger-fabric-items#pass-parameter-values-to-fabric-items-preview) to Functions, Spark job definitions, Pipeline, and Notebook.\n- Create [custom action](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-trigger-power-automate-flows) (Power Automate workflow) that you can reuse across Activator rules.\n- Send Teams message to [group chats and channels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-limitations#allowed-chats-and-channel-for-teams-notifications).\n- Customize email and Teams recipients and messages.\n\n\\*Lifecycle management for Activator/User data function integration will be available soon by mid-December.\n\n## How it Works\n\nYou can access this feature by creating an Activator item or access it in embedded experience like in [Real-Time hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-hub/set-alerts-data-streams?context=%2Ffabric%2Fcontext%2Fcontext-rti&amp;pivots=fabric) (coming soon in [Real-Time dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-get-data-real-time-dashboard), Eventhouse, and [KQL Queryset)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-alert-queryset?tabs=visualization).\n\nFor example, in Real-Time Hub, the ‘Set alert’ button is visible when browsing data sources like [Azure events](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-hub/set-alerts-azure-blob-storage-events?context=%2Ffabric%2Fcontext%2Fcontext-rti&amp;pivots=fabric), [Fabric events](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-hub/set-alerts-fabric-workspace-item-events?context=%2Ffabric%2Fcontext%2Fcontext-rti&amp;pivots=fabric), or [Eventstream](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-hub/set-alerts-data-streams?context=%2Ffabric%2Fcontext%2Fcontext-rti&amp;pivots=fabric).\n\nSelecting ‘Set alert’ will open a side pane where you can set up conditions and actions, including notifications, [Fabric activities](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-trigger-fabric-items), and [custom action](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-trigger-power-automate-flows). By creating the rule, you can automate your business process leveraging Activator.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9.png)Actions available for automations in Fabric Activator\n\n## Share your feedback!\n\nTo try this feature now, head over to [Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/).
