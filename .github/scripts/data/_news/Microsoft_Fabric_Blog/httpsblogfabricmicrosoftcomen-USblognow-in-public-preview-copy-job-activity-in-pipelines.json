You can track execution outcomes, monitor performance, and quickly identify issues.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-18.png)Navigating to monitor your Copy job activity brings you to the Copy Job monitoring page.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-19.png)The monitoring experience for Copy Job.\n\n## What is the Copy job Activity\n\nThe Copy job Activity orchestrates the Copy job item, which is designed to make data ingestion easier and more powerful, within Microsoft Fabric Data Factory pipelines:\n\n- **No-code simplicity**: Select an existing Copy job or create a new one right from your pipeline canvas.\n\n- **Flexible orchestration**: Chain Copy jobs with other activities like notebooks, dataflows, conditional logic, and even Power BI refresh – ideal for building medallion architecture or orchestrating downstream processing.\n\n- **Email support:** With the Copy job activity + Outlook activity, you can trigger Copy jobs and send notifications or status updates via email directly to your pipeline.\n\n- **Comprehensive Copy job capabilities:** Incorporates all Copy job features, including both batch and incremental copy with CDC, along with intuitive monitoring for built-in telemetry.\n\nWhether you’re building a quick prototype or orchestrating complex data workflows, the Copy job Activity helps you do more with less.\n\n## Copy activity vs. Copy job activity\n\nYou might have used the Copy activity in pipelines before. The Copy job activity introduces a bunch of new and exciting features that makes copying data easier than before. Both the Copy activity and the Copy job activity move data but Copy job makes the process of getting your data movement process started much faster and simpler.\n\nThe Copy job activity builds on the Copy job item, which was created in response to customer feedback asking for a simpler way to ingest data, with native support for multiple delivery styles, including bulk copy, incremental copy, and change data capture (CDC) replication. Now, with Copy job activity, you can reuse that logic inside pipelines; adding conditional execution, retries, and chaining with other activities.\n\nCheck out our blog post on what Copy job has to offer [Simplifying Data Ingestion with Copy job.](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/simplifying-data-ingestion-with-copy-job-incremental-copy-ga-lakehouse-upserts-and-new-connectors)\n\n## Learn more with our documentation\n\n- [Copy job Activity in Data Factory pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/copy-job-activity)\n\n- [What is Copy job in Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/what-is-copy-job)"
