Whether you’re tuning example queries, refining instructions, or validating performance, these updates make it faster to iterate and deliver high-quality experiences to your users.\n\n## New Debugging Tools\n\n### View referenced example queries\n\nYou can now inspect which example queries were retrieved and applied when a user asks a question. The **Run Steps view** shows you exactly which examples influenced the final query — making it easy to confirm that the right examples were used or diagnose when unexpected results occur.\n\n![Screenshot of the referenced example queries in the run steps.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-of-the-referenced-example-queries-in-th-1.png)\n\nIf you notice the wrong examples being referenced, try refining your few-shot questions or adding more targeted examples for improved accuracy.\n\n### View diagnostic details\n\nA new **Diagnostic Summary** lets you download a detailed trace of the agent’s reasoning steps — beyond what’s visible in the run step view. Use it to analyze internal logic, clean up data for review, or share with the Fabric support team when reporting issues.\n\n![View diagnostics](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/diagnostics-download.png)\n\n## Higher Limits for Example Queries and Instructions\n\nWe’ve expanded the limits for both **data source instructions** and **example queries**, giving you more room to express complex logic and richer context for your data sources.\n\n| Config | Previous Limit | New Limit | | --- | --- | --- | | Data source instructions for eventhouse | 5,000 characters | 15,000 characters | | SQL Example Queries | 1,000 characters | 5,000 characters | | KQL Example Queries | 1,000 characters | 5,000 characters |\n\nThese higher limits help creators provide more context, handle multi-step logic, and improve model grounding.\n\n## SDK Enhancements for Example Query Validation\n\nThe **Fabric Data Agent SDK** now includes tools to evaluate and improve the quality of your few-shot examples. Using the new evaluate\\_few\\_shot\\_examples() function, you can validate each natural language/SQL pair and receive a detailed summary of which examples passed or failed.\n\n| ```<br><br>result = evaluate_few_shot_examples( examples, <br> llm_client=llm_client, <br> model_name=model_name, <br> batch_size=20, <br> use_fabric_llm=True)<br>``` | | --- |\n\nAfter running validation:\n\n- **Success Cases –** strong examples where the SQL matched the expected result.\n- **Failure Cases –** examples that didn’t align with the schema or question intent.\n\nYou can easily convert these into DataFrames for review:\n\n| ```<br>success_df = cases_to_dataframe(result.success_cases)<br><br>failure_df = cases_to_dataframe(result.failure_cases)<br><br>display(success_df)<br>display(failure_df)<br><br>``` | | --- |\n\nIteratively improving weaker examples helps your Data Agent generate more accurate SQL and deliver better results for new questions.\n\n![Screenshot of example query validator results.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-of-example-query-validator-results-1-1.png)\n\nTo explore a full working example, you can check out the [Data Agent Example Queries.](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/data-agent-example-queries)\n\n## Markdown Editor for Instructions\n\nAgent and data source instructions can now be authored using **Markdown**, making them easier to read, structure, and maintain. This helps both creators and users clearly understand the context and intent behind your Data Agent’s behavior.\n\n![Screenshot of adding data agent level instructions to the data agent](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/screenshot-of-adding-data-agent-level-instructions-1.png)\n\nUse Markdown to:\n\n- Define priorities for data sources.\n- Add structured lists, headings, or tables.\n- Clarify query logic or special handling rules.\n- Provide context on tables, columns, and relationships.\n\nThis improvement encourages better documentation practices and clearer communication between creators, users, and the Data Agent itself.\n\nFor templates and best practices, refer to the [Data Agent Configurations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/data-agent-configurations) documentation.\n\n## Multi-Tasking Flow for Easier Creation\n\nWe’ve introduced a new **multi-tasking flow** that allows creators to seamlessly switch between **chatting with the Data Agent** and **configuring its settings** — without losing context or progress.\n\nThis workflow was built to address key creator pain points:\n\n- **Context switching made simple** — Move fluidly between testing questions in chat and editing instructions or examples.\n- **Faster iteration** — Instantly test configuration changes in chat without reopening or reloading the workspace or losing context about the data source schema.\n\nThe result is a smoother, more efficient authoring experience that keeps you focused on improving your agent’s intelligence — not managing tabs or reloading configurations.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nTogether, these updates make it easier than ever to **create, debug, and iterate** on Data Agents. You’ll spend less time switching contexts or troubleshooting, and more time building intelligent, reliable agents that deliver accurate insights from your data.\n\nTo learn more about configuring your Data Agent, visit the documentation: [Configure a Data Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/data-agent-configurations).",
