The best part is, [OneLake speaks the same language your applications already do](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/onelake-access-api).\n\nWith support for the ubiquitous [Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/data-lake-storage-gen2) or [Blob Storage APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api), OneLake makes it easy to bring your existing applications and tools into the Fabric ecosystem without rewriting a single line of code. If your apps already work with Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage – like [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/storage/storage-explorer/) – they’ll feel right at home in OneLake. All you have to do is use the OneLake endpoints:\n\n``` https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/<workspace>/<item>.<itemtype>/<path>/<fileName>\n\nhttps://onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com/<workspace>/<item>.<itemtype>/<path>/<fileName> ```\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nOrganizations have invested heavily in applications, scripts, and workflows built on Blob and ADLS APIs. Migrating to a new platform often means costly rewrites and long timelines—but not with OneLake. By supporting these familiar APIs, OneLake ensures:\n\n- **Seamless migration**: Move your workloads to OneLake without changing your existing code.\n- **Immediate compatibility**: Your tools, SDKs, and scripts that use Blob or DFS APIs just work.\n- **Faster innovation**: Focus on building new capabilities instead of re-engineering old ones.\n\nThis compatibility means you can start leveraging the power of Microsoft Fabric and OneLake today, without disruption.\n\n### See it in Action\n\nThe [OneLake APIs in Action guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/onelake-apis-in-action) shows you exactly how this works. You’ll find an end-to-end C# example using the [Azu](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-dotnet-get-started)[re Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-dotnet-get-started) and [Distributed File System (DFS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-directory-file-acl-dotnet) libraries with OneLake, plus tips for getting good performance and best practices when working with a cloud file system. The guide uses open[mirroring](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/database/mirrored-database/open-mirroring-landing-zone-format) to replicate data from an on-premises system to OneLake Delta tables. It’s the perfect starting point for developers and data engineers who want to make the most of OneLake’s capabilities.",
