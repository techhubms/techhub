These authentication methods are our recommended approach for production environments, ensuring:\n\n- **Operational reliability**: Avoid issues tied to user credentials, such as password changes or account deactivation.\n- **Enterprise-grade security**: Service-based authentication reduces risk and simplifies compliance.\n- **Consistent automation**: Keep your pipelines running smoothly without manual intervention.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-23-1024x492.png)SJD supports connection property now\n\n## Why it Matters\n\nPreviously, many customers relied on user authentication for pipeline runs, which can lead to broken workflows when users leave the organization or tokens expire. By enabling SPN and WI through the connection property, you gain:\n\n- **Scalable orchestration** for notebooks in complex workflows.\n- **Better governance** with centralized identity management.\n- **Future-proof automation** for production workloads.\n\n## How to Get Started\n\n1. In your pipeline, add a **Spark job definition activity**.\n2. Under **Connection**, you can configure a new connection or use an existing one.\n3. Provide the required credentials or identity configuration (you can use SPN and WI now).\n4. Run your pipeline and enjoy a secure, automated experience.\n\nTo learn more, check out our documentation on the [Spark Job Definition activity](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/spark-job-definition-activity).",
