With Copy Job Activity, users can now enjoy the simplicity and speed of Copy Job while leveraging the orchestration power and flexibility of Data Factory pipelines.\n\n## **What is the Copy job Activity**\n\n**Copy Job Activity** allows you to run **Copy jobs as native activities inside Data Factory pipelines**.\n\nCopy jobs are created and managed independently in Data Factory for quick data movement between supported sources and destinations. With Copy job Activity, that same fast, lightweight experience is now embedded within pipelines, making it easier to automate, schedule, and chain Copy jobs as part of broader data workflows.\n\n![Copy job activity in pipeline](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/copyjobactivity.png)Copy job activity in pipeline\n\nThe Copy job Activity orchestrates the Copy job item, which is designed to make data ingestion easier and more powerful, within Microsoft Fabric Data Factory pipelines:\n\n- **No-code simplicity**: Select an existing Copy job or create a new one right from your pipeline canvas.\n\n- **Flexible orchestration**: Chain Copy jobs with other activities like notebooks, dataflows, conditional logic, and even Power BI refresh – ideal for building medallion architecture or orchestrating downstream processing.\n\n- **Email support:**With the Copy job activity + Outlook activity, you can trigger Copy jobs and send notifications or status updates via email directly to your pipeline.\n\n- **Comprehensive Copy job capabilities:**Incorporates all Copy job features, including both batch and incremental copy with CDC, along with intuitive monitoring for built-in telemetry.\n\nWhether you’re building a quick prototype or orchestrating complex data workflows, the Copy job Activity helps you do more with less.\n\nThe Copy job activity builds on the Copy job item, which was created in response to customer feedback asking for a simpler way to ingest data, with native support for multiple delivery styles, including bulk copy, incremental copy, and change data capture (CDC) replication. Now, with Copy job activity, you can reuse that logic inside pipelines; adding conditional execution, retries, and chaining with other activities.\n\nCheck out our blog post on what Copy job has to offer [Simplifying Data Ingestion with Copy job.](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/simplifying-data-ingestion-with-copy-job-incremental-copy-ga-lakehouse-upserts-and-new-connectors)\n\n## Learn more with our documentation\n\n- [Copy job Activity in Data Factory pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/copy-job-activity)\n\n- [What is Copy job in Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/what-is-copy-job)",
