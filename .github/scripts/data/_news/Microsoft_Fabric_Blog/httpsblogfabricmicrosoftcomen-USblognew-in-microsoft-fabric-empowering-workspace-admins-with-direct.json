  "EnhancedContent": "Big news for Fabric users, managing workloads just got a lot easier! With the new Workspace-level assignment feature, workspace admins can now add additional workloads directly to their own workspaces—no more waiting on tenant or capacity-level setup.\n\nThis update makes using additional workloads more accessible than ever. Once a workload is added, you can immediately create custom Fabric items in that workspace, giving teams the flexibility to build exactly what they need, where they need it.\n\nThe result? A more agile, scalable, and responsive Fabric experience—while still preserving governance and security.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Recording-2025-09-11-aadasdasdas.gif)Assigning additional workload to workspace from the workload hub\n\nAdd workloads from the [Workloads Hub](https://app.powerbi.com/workloadhub/) and assign workloads directly to the workspace where the data and team is working.\n\n## Why This Matters Whether you’re a developer, analyst, or admin\n\n- Faster onboarding: Teams can start using workloads without waiting for capacity-level setup and minimize the impact on the rest of the tenant.\n- More autonomy: Workspace admins control which workloads are added to their workspaces.\n- Better governance: Workload assignment can be fully customized to meet the organization’s policy requirements. This helps organizations adopt workloads more quickly while keeping control where it’s needed.\n\nWith workspace-level assignment, you can now enable multiple workloads in a specific workspace without affecting the rest of the tenant. This allows teams to experiment, innovate, and deploy solutions tailored to their needs.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screencapture-msit-powerbi-workloadhub-my-2025-09-11-22_10_43.png)Additional public workloads in the workload hub\n\n## Additional workloads that can be assigned to a workspace:\n\n- Osmos: Helps ingest messy, fragmented data from multiple sources. Its AI Agents meet data ‘where it is’, whether in OneLake, spreadsheets, or external systems, and unify schemas using Osmos Data Wrangler, no code, no pipelines. By assigning Osmos to a workspace, teams can quickly bring together data from different formats and sources, making it ready for downstream processing.\n- Profisee: Once data is ingested, Profisee helps clean and enrich it. It deduplicates records across sources, builds Golden Records, and applies data quality rules. Business users are guided to resolve missing values, ensuring the data is complete and reliable. Assigning Profisee to a workspace enables teams to transform raw data into governed insights ready for reporting, analytics, or AI.\n\n## Governance and Consent\n\nFabric admins retain complete control on the availability of workloads in the tenant by configuring the newly added ‘Allow workspace admins to add workloads’ [Tenant Settings](https://app.powerbi.com/admin-portal/tenantSettings) under the Additional Workloads settings It’s enabled by default, and Fabric admins can turn it off at any time\n\nEven with this new flexibility, Entra ID consent continues to apply as before. Users and/or tenant admins must still provide consent according to tenant policies before workloads can be used.\n\n## Learn More\n\n- To learn more, please refer to the [Add a workload in the workload hub](http://aka.ms/addworkload) and [Authentication overview](https://aka.ms/EntraIDConsent) documentation.",
