  "EnhancedContent": "We’re launching a new community contest inviting you to build innovative workload concepts that showcase what’s possible with the [Fabric Extensibility Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/extensibility-toolkit/overview-story).\n\nThe Toolkit gives you full creative range: new UX components, API interactions, Notebook-driven experiences, shortcuts, and even early explorations of new item types. Getting started often takes under an hour, and great concepts can take shape over a weekend.\n\n**Contest Timeline**\n\n- **Opens:** December 16, 2025\n- **Closes:** February 13, 2026\n- **Winners Announced:** February 20, 2026\n\nThis contest is about ideas—not production-ready workloads. Show the concept clearly, however you prefer: a lightweight prototype, mocked UX flow, short demo video, or simple GitHub scaffolding.\n\nTop entries will be showcased on the Fabric Community Blog and promoted across social channels—and the winning creator earns a free pass to [FabCon Atlanta](https://fabriccon.com/)!\n\n**Find full details, judging criteria, and submission requirements on the** [**Fabric Community Site.**](https://aka.ms/exttoolkit/contest)",
