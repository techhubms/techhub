  "EnhancedContent": "In healthcare, data security is not just a technical priority—it’s an ethical and legal imperative. From **electronic health records (EHRs)** to population health analytics and research data, healthcare organizations working with platforms like **Microsoft Fabric** must protect sensitive health information while navigating a complex web of regulatory requirements, most notably **HIPAA** and regional health privacy laws.\n\nYet, as healthcare teams embrace cloud-native analytics and real-time collaboration, the risk of unintended exposure of protected health information (**PHI**) rises. Fortunately, **Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies** are purpose-built to help healthcare organizations maintain compliance and keep sensitive patient data secure across the Microsoft Fabric environment.\n\n## The Compliance Challenge in Healthcare\n\nHealthcare organizations are entrusted with massive volumes of highly sensitive information—patient names, diagnoses, treatments, insurance details, and more. Compliance frameworks like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (**HIPAA**) in the U.S., as well as similar healthcare privacy laws worldwide, impose strict obligations on:\n\n- **Data discovery and protection** of PHI\n- **Monitoring of access and sharing**\n- **Preventing unauthorized disclosure**\n- **Incident reporting and auditability**\n\nStandard security tools often fall short when applied to the dynamic, collaborative world delivered by Microsoft Fabric; this is where **Purview DLP policies** come in.\n\n## How Purview DLP Safeguards Healthcare Data in Microsoft Fabric\n\nMicrosoft Purview DLP delivers comprehensive and automated protection tailored for the unique needs of healthcare organizations**:**\n\n**1.

This makes it easier to pinpoint exactly where PHI resides within Fabric, from Lakehouses to clinical models, fueling reports in Power BI.\n\n**2. Real-Time User Guidance and Education**\n\nWhen a clinician, researcher, or analyst attempts an action that could put PHI at risk—such as downloading a sensitive dataset or sharing reports with an external partner—DLP provides real-time policy tips during the user interaction, reinforcing the organization’s privacy culture in-context.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-26.png)DLP indication in Fabric, opens a side panel with a policy tip that contains all the information\n\n**3. Audit Trails and Incident Reporting**\n\nPurview provides detailed logs and reports, offering a clear audit trail of who accessed PHI, when, and how it was used.
