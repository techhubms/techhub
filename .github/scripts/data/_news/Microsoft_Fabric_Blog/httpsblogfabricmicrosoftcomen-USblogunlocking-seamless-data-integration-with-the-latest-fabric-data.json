The Lakehouse connector now helps users handle this complexity more gracefully through delta column mapping and deletion vector support. With column mapping, you can align source and destination fields even when schema changes occur, reducing the risk of pipeline failures and minimizing the need for manual adjustments. Deletion vector support ensures that records marked as deleted are handled cleanly during reads, so your downstream analytics always reflect the most accurate view of the data. Together, these capabilities empower teams to adapt to evolving data models without disruption, keeping data pipelines resilient and analytics trustworthy.\n- Learn more details about this feature from the [Lakehouse connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-lakehouse-copy-activity) documentation.\n\n**Handle large text data in Fabric Data Warehouse Connector**\n\n- Modern enterprises often deal with unstructured or semi-structured data—think customer feedback, product descriptions, or logs—that don’t fit neatly into small, fixed-length fields. With support for the **varchar(max)** data type in the Fabric Data Warehouse connector, you can now ingest and store extremely large text values without hitting size limitations. This unlocks new integration scenarios such as bringing in detailed customer notes from CRM systems, storing machine-generated text, or capturing long-form content from applications. By supporting varchar(max), Fabric Data Factory ensures your data movement tasks can accommodate today’s data diversity, while keeping performance and compatibility optimized for enterprise-scale workloads. Support for varchar(max) means you can now handle large and complex text data with ease, opening doors for more advanced analytics scenarios.\n- Learn more details about this feature from [Data warehouse connector documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/connector-data-warehouse-copy-activity#mapping).\n\n![data type settings in DW connector](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dwvarcharmax.png)\n\n**Stronger data integrity with temporal data in MongoDB & MongoDB Atlas Connector**\n\n- Time is at the heart of many business processes whether it’s tracking user activity, monitoring IoT signals, or recording transaction histories. With new support for Timestamp and Date data types in the MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas connectors, Fabric Data Factory ensures that temporal data is preserved with full fidelity during ingestion. Instead of being flattened into strings or approximated, these values maintain their precision and semantics across your pipelines. This not only improves data integrity but also enables richer downstream analytics such as time-series analysis, trend reporting, or real-time monitoring while ensuring consistency with the way your applications natively store and interpret time-based data.\n- Learn more details about this feature from [Data type mapping section from MongoDB connector documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/connector-mongodb-copy-activity#mapping) and [MongoDB Atlas connector documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/connector-mongodb-atlas-copy-activity#mapping).\n\n**Strengthen Governance in Azure Databricks Connector**\n\n- Enterprises often organize their data across multiple catalogs in Azure Databricks Unity Catalog, separating workloads by department, project, or compliance requirements. The Azure Databricks connector in Fabric Data Factory now lets users configure which Unity Catalog to read data from, giving teams precise control over their integration pipelines. Instead of being limited to a default catalog, you can now target the exact catalog that holds the data you need—whether it’s a governed production dataset, a sandbox environment for experimentation, or a catalog reserved for sensitive, compliance-regulated data. This ensures that data movement projects stay aligned with organizational data policies, minimize cross-catalog confusion, and accelerate integration by reducing manual adjustments. By supporting catalog-level configuration, Fabric Data Factory makes it easier for enterprises to keep their data movement both flexible and secure while scaling across diverse data domains.\n- Learn more details about this feature from the [settings from Azure Databricks connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-azure-databricks-copy-activity) documentation.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-26.png)\n\n### **Greater alignment with DB2 environments**\n\n- The DB2 connector now supports specifying a package collection directly within the pipeline, giving enterprises finer control over how queries are compiled and executed. In DB2, package collections are often used to organize and manage access to precompiled SQL packages across different applications or environments. By allowing this configuration as an advanced setting in copy activity, Fabric Data Factory makes it easier for data engineers to align pipelines with existing DB2 database setups—whether that means adhering to departmental standards, optimizing performance, or meeting governance requirements. This enhancement not only streamlines integration with DB2 systems but also ensures smoother collaboration between database administrators and integration teams, reducing friction and increasing reliability in enterprise-scale workloads.\n- Learn more details about this feature from the [DB2 connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-ibm-db2-database-copy-activity#source)documentation.\n\n![connection property settings in DB2 connector](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-56.png)\n\n### **Run with the right access via Snowflake Connector**\n\n- The Snowflake connector now allows users to specify a role directly within the pipeline, providing precise control over the privileges used during data movement. In Snowflake, roles define what objects a user can access and what actions they can perform, which is critical for enforcing security and compliance policies. By exposing this as an advanced setting in copy activity, Fabric Data Factory pipelines automatically run with the correct permissions. For instance, an enterprise may have separate roles for data analysts, finance teams, and operations teams, each with different access levels. With role-based configuration, pipelines can safely ingest data according to the appropriate access rules, reducing the risk of unauthorized access while maintaining full alignment with organizational governance. This feature empowers teams to operate securely at scale, without slowing down development or requiring manual intervention.\n- Learn more details about this feature from the [Snowflake connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-snowflake-copy-activity#source) documentation.\n\n![Connection property settings in Snowflake connector](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-57.png)\n\n### **Accelerate Azure PostgreSQL Scenarios**\n\n- Upsert on write for incremental data loads: The Azure Database for PostgreSQL version 2.0 connector now supports upsert operations, allowing you to efficiently merge new and updated records into your target tables. This is especially valuable for enterprise scenarios where data changes frequently, such as transactional systems, CRM updates, or IoT data streams. Instead of performing full table overwrites or building complex merge logic, it can now intelligently insert, or update records as needed. This reduces pipeline complexity, improves performance, and ensures that your PostgreSQL tables always reflect the most accurate and up-to-date data.\n- Learn more details about this feature from the [Azure Database for PostgreSQL connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-azure-database-for-postgresql-copy-activity).\n\n![Table operation for upsert in Azure PostgreSQL connector](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-59.png)\n- Script activity support for flexible database logic: In addition to standard copy operations, the connector now supports script activity, enabling users to execute custom SQL scripts directly within the pipeline. This provides flexibility for pre-processing, data transformations, or executing database-side logic without leaving the Fabric Data Factory environment. For example, you can run maintenance tasks, create temporary staging tables, or implement conditional logic—all as part of your automated workflow. By integrating script activity, enterprises can streamline complex data processes while keeping governance, auditing, and pipeline orchestration centralized.\n- Learn more details about this feature from the [Azure Database for PostgreSQL connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/connector-azure-database-for-postgresql-overview) documentation.\n\n## 4.
