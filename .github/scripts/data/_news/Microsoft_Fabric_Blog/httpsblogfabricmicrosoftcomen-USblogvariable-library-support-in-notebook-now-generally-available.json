With Variable Library support in notebooks, you can:\n\n- **Centralize configuration management** for notebooks without hardcoding values.\n- **Enable dynamic parameterization** for Spark settings, lakehouse bindings, and compute configurations.\n- **Simplify CI/CD pipelines** by using variables across environments and stages.\n\n## **Key Highlights**\n\n- **NotebookUtils Integration** – Access variables programmatically in your notebook code using the NotebookUtils Variable library utilities APIs, run the notebookutils.variableLibrary.help() to get more detailed usage.\n- **Service Principal (SPN) support –** SPN authentication is now available for Variable Library, enabling secure, automated processes in enterprise CI/CD pipelines and notebook activity pipelines.\n- **Use %%configure to dynamically assign runtime settings** – Combine Variable Library with %%configure to bind environment-specific runtime settings in the notebook, such as the default lakehouse, without manual edits.\n\nThe following is an example of how to use Variable Library in notebook.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/variable-library-1-1024x324.png)Define variables in Variable library ![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/UseVL-1-1024x568.png)Use Variable library in notebook\n\n## Resources\n\n- [NotebookUtils (former MSSparkUtils) for Fabric – Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#variable-library-utilities)\n- Use %%configure dynamically customize your notebook session with Variable library: [Develop, execute, and manage notebooks – Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/author-execute-notebook#spark-session-configuration-magic-command)\n- Spark Development best practice – How to replace parameters in notebook CI/CD flow: [Development and Monitoring – Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/spark-best-practices-development-monitoring#cicd-flow)",
