In our view, this recognition reflects our commitment to help organizations unify their data estate and unlock the full potential of AI.\n\nTo us, Microsoft’s recognition as **a Leader** in Gartner Magic Quadrant for Data Integration Tools 2025 is a clear signal of trust and innovation. Gartner evaluates vendors on two critical dimensions: **Completeness of Vision** and **Ability to Execute**. Microsoft’s approach to unify data integration, analytics, governance, and AI through **Microsoft Fabric**, gives organizations confidence that they are investing in a solution built for the future.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpg)\n\n*Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.

Fabric delivers an all-in-one, **software-as-a-service (SaaS)** experience that spans data ingestion, engineering, science, real-time intelligence, and visualization—all built on **Microsoft** **OneLake**, a single, unified data lake for your entire organization. With **28,000 customers and 60% year-over-year growth**, Fabric helps organizations accelerate insights and unlock new possibilities.\n\nWith OneLake, you can access your entire multi-cloud data estate from a single data lake that spans the entire organization. By unifying data in one place and breaking down silos, it can become the single point for all your users to discover and explore your organization’s data. With OneLake, you load your data once and use that single copy across every Fabric workload and engine, eliminating duplication and reducing complexity. Recent enhancements make OneLake even more powerful: the **OneLake catalog** now provides a central hub for data discovery, governance, and collaboration, enabling teams to browse and manage all data items from a single intuitive interface. OneLake also supports **cross-format flexibility**, allowing Delta Lake tables to be accessed as Apache Iceberg automatically—without data movement or conversion. Combined with external data sharing enhancements and integration with tools like Excel and Snowflake, OneLake acts as the central hub for seamless connectivity, accessibility, and collaboration, empowering organizations to unify their data estate and unlock AI-driven insights at scale.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric offers innovative approaches to unify data into OneLake, tailored to meet your specific needs:\n\n- **Fabric Data Factory** integrates seamlessly with OneLake, offering powerful cloud-scale services for data movement, orchestration, transformation, deployment, and monitoring. These capabilities enable organizations to tackle even the most complex ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) scenarios, unifying data estates, streamlining operations, and unlocking the full potential of their data.\n- **Shortcuts and mirroring** offer a zero-copy, zero-ETL approach to bring data into OneLake. Shortcuts virtualize data from multiple clouds directly into OneLake, eliminating duplication and enabling instant analysis through live connections to the source. Complementing this, mirroring introduces a zero-ETL approach to replicate operational databases into the lake, ensuring synchronized, up-to-date data for analytics and reporting. Together, these capabilities simplify integration, maintain consistency, and keep data ready for immediate insights across all environments.\n- **Fabric Real-Time Intelligence** empowers organizations to ingest and process streaming and high granularity data instantaneously, driving real-time insights and automating decision-making. This solution is ideal for applications requiring immediate data updates, such as IoT analytics, fraud detection, and operational dashboards. Leveraging cutting-edge data processing frameworks, Real-Time Intelligence enables scalability, reliability, and low-latency performance, making it suitable for high-volume streaming scenarios.\n\nFabric empowers organizations to break down data silos, streamline workflows, and unlock the full potential of their data. Whether it’s through seamless data integration, real-time insights, or multi-cloud collaboration, Fabric is designed to address modern data needs. Customers can use Fabric for batch processing, incremental updates, and real-time streaming, making it an essential tool for secure, scalable data management.\n\n**Customer Success**\n\nReal [customer experiences](https://aka.ms/Fabricfeaturedcustomers) show how Microsoft Fabric is making a measurable difference.
