Esri empowers businesses, governments, and communities to tackle the world’s most pressing challenges through spatial analysis.\n\nMicrosoft and Esri have partnered together to bring spatial analytics into Microsoft Fabric which is now Generally Available for production scenarios. Our collaboration with Esri introduces cutting-edge spatial analytics integrated within Microsoft Fabric Spark notebooks and Spark job definitions (across both Data Engineering and Data Science experiences).\n\nThis integrated product experience empowers Spark developers and data scientists to natively use Esri capabilities and run GeoAnalytics functions and tools within Fabric Spark for transformation, enrichment, and pattern / trend analysis of data across different use cases without any need for separate installation and configuration.\n\n## ArcGIS GeoAnalytics capabilities\n\nArcGIS GeoAnalytics offers a comprehensive suite of geospatial capabilities that cater to a wide range of applications. Esri is integrating components of the ArcGIS suite of products into Microsoft Fabric. Specifically, ArcGIS GeoAnalytics for Microsoft Fabric product brings a set of geospatial functions and tools functions and tools directly into the Fabric Spark environment to facilitate analysis of events, visualize relationships between places, and derive valuable insights from your data.\n\n- Data engineering and transformations – within Data Science and Data Engineering notebooks, or as part of Data Factory Pipelines:\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-29400-1.png)\n\n- Hotspot and clustering analysis – identify statistically significant spatial clusters of high values (hot spots) and low values (cold spots), spatial outliers, or groupings of similar features:\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-29400-2.jpeg)\n\n- Spatial pattern identification and analysis – gain insight into overall patterns of features and their associated values for different distributions or across different time periods:\n\n![Inserting image...](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/inserting-image-.png)\n\n- Spatial joins for data enrichment and location analytics – add location-based context based on spatial proximity or proximity across both space and time:\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-29400-4.png)\n\n- Track and movement analysis – analyze patterns in GPS or other types of track data to detect incidents, calculate motion statistics, and understand change in location over time:\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-29400-5.png)\n\n- Aggregation and enrichment for use in Power BI dashboards – write results back into OneLake for use in Power BI, or schedule your workflows to drive automated updates:\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-29400-6.png)\n\nBeyond the ArcGIS GeoAnalytics capabilities, you can also do more with your spatial data inside Fabric using [ArcGIS for Power BI](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/microsoft-365/latest/power-bi/get-started-with-arcgis-for-power-bi.htm). This enables greater flexibility for custom data visualization in Microsoft Power BI that you can use to bring spatial insight to your reports and dashboards.\n\nThese capabilities and much more enable organizations to leverage geographic context for better decision-making and operational efficiency.\n\nYou can learn more about Esri’s ArcGIS product suite from the [ArcGIS Architecture Center](https://architecture.arcgis.com/en/overview/introduction-to-arcgis/arcgis-capabilities.html), and more about the [ArcGIS and Fabric integrations](https://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/arcgis-for-microsoft/arcgis-for-microsoft-fabric?rsource=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esri.com%2Fen-us%2Fc%2Fproduct%2Fspatial-analytics-in-microsoft-fabric).\n\n## Get started today\n\nTo learn more about ArcGIS integration within Microsoft Fabric Spark, please refer to the documentation: [ArcGIS GeoAnalytics for Microsoft Fabric (Generally Available).](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/spark-arcgis-geoanalytics?tabs=python)",
