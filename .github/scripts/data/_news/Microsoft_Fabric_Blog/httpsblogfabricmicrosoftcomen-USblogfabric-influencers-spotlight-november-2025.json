  "EnhancedContent": "Welcome to the November edition of the Fabric Influencers Spotlight, a recurring monthly post here to shine a bright light on the places on the internet where Microsoft MVPs & Fabric Super Users are doing some amazing work on all aspects of Microsoft Fabric.\n\nThe Microsoft Fabric Community team has created the Fabric Influencers Spotlight to highlight and amplify blog posts, videos, presentations, and other content related to Microsoft Fabric. We’ve cultivated submissions from members of Microsoft MVPs & Fabric Super Users from the Fabric community that cover the Fabric Platform, Data Engineering & Data Science in Fabric, Data Warehousing, Power BI, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Integration, Fabric Administration & Governance and Databases.\n\nMicrosoft Most Valuable Professionals, or MVPs, are technology experts who utilize their deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services to bring together diverse platforms, products, and solutions, to solve real world problems, and to bring ‘leading edge’ content to the data community. To learn about the Microsoft MVP Award and to find MVPs, visit the [official website](https://mvp.microsoft.com/).\n\nFabric Super Users are the heroes of the Fabric Community. They contribute helpful answers, write informative blog posts, post data stories and are key contributors to the Fabric product via engagement with the product group. To learn more about the Super User program, visit the [official website](https://aka.ms/SuperUsers).\n\nAnd if you haven’t heard, Fabric Data Days is on now! Take your Power BI skills to the next level with live learning sessions, QuickViz challenges, discount vouchers for exam PL-300 and DP-600, and community connection. See what’s happening this week and jump in today: [Fabric Data Days](https://aka.ms/fdd/schedule).\n\n## Power BI\n\n### Wyn Hopkins, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wynhopkins/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Simpler DAX with New Calendar Functionality – Power BI Preview](https://youtu.be/BDL6nLPKFI4?si=crU2iS2rUI-mjI63)\n\nA guide to understanding and implementing the new Calendar Options in Power BI with 3 different examples to understand the benefits and how they work.\n\n### Parul Sagar, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parul-rani-sagar)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog: [Dynamic Change Tracking for LMS Enrolments Using Power Query M](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Power-BI-Community-Blog/Dynamic-Change-Tracking-for-LMS-Enrolments-Using-Power-Query-M/ba-p/4854637)\n\nIn this post, we will build a snapshot change tracking solution using Power Query (M language) that automatically identifies added and deleted enrolments between consecutive snapshots.\n\n## Data Engineering\n\n### Thomas ‘Tom’ Martens, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommartens68/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [Entra ID Group expansion – the complete guide](https://minceddata.net/Getting+social/Blog/Monitoring+Fabric/Entra+ID+Group+Expansion+-+the+complete+guide)\n\nExpanding Entra ID groups to the single user level reveals invaluable information without the hassle of doing it manually, especially when the Entra ID groups are nested. The notebook not only allows expanding Entra ID groups, including nested groups, but also accounts for the Graph API’s limits (number of requests per time unit). This expanded users can then be used to provide Row Level Security or answer questions like “Who has access to?”\n\n### Aleksi Partanen, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksi-partanen/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Understanding Delta Tables and Lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric](https://youtu.be/eZD89I6xLXg)\n\nThis video explains the core ideas and concepts behind Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse and Delta Tables in a clear and beginner friendly way. It shows how Delta Tables work, how to optimize and partition them for better performance, how Lakehouse stores data in OneLake, and how shortcuts let you virtualize external sources like ADLS, S3, and Dataverse. You will also see practical demos that make these concepts easy to understand.\n\n## Data Science\n\n### Sahir Maharaj, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahir-maharaj/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [Advanced Pipelines & Transformers for Data Science in Microsoft Fabric](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Science-Community-Blog/Advanced-Pipelines-amp-Transformers-for-Data-Science-in/ba-p/4812307)\n\nIn this edition, we’re exploring, advanced pipelines and why they’re such a gift for data professionals. You’ll learn how they bring structure and consistency into your work, making every project cleaner and easier to manage. From there, we’ll move into custom transformers – building your own step-by-step so you can add domain-specific logic that no off-the-shelf tool can handle.\n\n## Fabric Platform, Administrative & Governance\n\n### Andy Cutler, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andycutler/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [Fabric Architecture: Azure Tenants](https://www.serverlesssql.com/fabric-architecture-azure-tenants/)\n\nOur Fabric Architecture journey starts with Azure Tenants. If you’re ready to spent time sketching out your Fabric Capacity planning, workspace strategy, domain topology, lakehouse/warehouse creation, data loading processes…you might want to stop for a minute and think about tenants. The question I’d like you to consider is “What do I need to know when working with a single or a multi-tenancy approach?”\n\n### Rajendra Ongole, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajendra-ongole)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [GraphQL Explained: Transforming Data Access in Microsoft Fabric](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-platform-Community-Blog/GraphQL-Explained-Transforming-Data-Access-in-Microsoft-Fabric/bc-p/4869106#M99)\n\nGraphQL transforming Data Access in Microsoft Fabric enables developers to query only the data they need, improving efficiency and performance across analytics workloads. It provides a flexible, modern API layer in Fabric that simplifies data integration and accelerates building intelligent, data-driven applications.\n\n## Databases\n\n### Inturi Suparna Babu, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inturi-suparna-babu-312b59270/)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog: [Google BigQuery Mirroring in Microsoft Fabric: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Databases-Community-Blog/Google-BigQuery-Mirroring-in-Microsoft-Fabric-A-Step-by-Step/ba-p/4871175)\n\nIn this blog, I will walk through how to mirror Google BigQuery tables into Microsoft Fabric using the Mirrored Google BigQuery (Preview) feature. This allows organizations to operationalize data across cloud platforms without building or maintaining complex ETL pipelines.\n\n## Thanks for reading & we’ll see you next month!\n\nThat’s all for this month’s spotlight on the Microsoft Fabric Influencers. We wanted to extend our thanks to the MVPs and Super Users whose expertise continues to enrich the Fabric community. We anticipate the innovative ideas and valuable insights that will emerge in the coming months and invite everyone to stay engaged here on the Fabric Community Platform. Together, we will continue to deliver knowledge and collaboration that empowers every member of our community to achieve more. Stay tuned!",
