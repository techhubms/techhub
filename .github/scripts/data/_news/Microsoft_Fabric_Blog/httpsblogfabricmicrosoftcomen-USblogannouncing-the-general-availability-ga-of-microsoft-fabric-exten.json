You can update and deploy Fabric items to existing workspaces or new workspaces directly from VS Code—saving you time and effort. Fabric items, that have [Item definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/articles/item-management/definitions/item-definition-overview#definition-details-for-supported-item-types) API support, support this capability.\n\n![Import and export Notebook item definition](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Import-and-export-Notebook-item-definition.gif)Import and export Notebook item definition\n- [Git integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-integration-process) in Microsoft Fabric allows developers to seamlessly manage their codebase with version control for your items within a workspace. You can clone your Git enabled workspace using the extension and use VS Code’s source control experience to work with your items and push the changes to the repository. Only Azure DevOps is currently supported.\n\n![Git integration with user data functions item ](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Git-integration-UDF.gif)Git integration with User data functions item\n- Multi-workspace viewing and filtering: View all of your workspaces in the Fabric Extension rather than working with one workspace at a time.
