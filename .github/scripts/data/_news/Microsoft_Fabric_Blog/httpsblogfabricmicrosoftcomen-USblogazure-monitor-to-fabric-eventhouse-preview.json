Running on top of all this infrastructure are solutions (applications, APIs, etc.) handling operational data your business care about.\n\nQuerying data across your infrastructure telemetry, application telemetry and enterprise data can give you insights allowing you to troubleshoot issues you wouldn’t be able to otherwise.\n\n**Example**: at an airport, a few flights missed their turnaround time SLA. Ground crew complained the gate operations app was slow. If you have your server telemetry, you might be able to find anomalies (e.g. high CPU) on those servers. But if you have business data, e.g. turnaround time per flight, the gate associated with each flight and are able to parse your API telemetry to know which server handled requests which gate, then you are likely able to obtain much more insights into your operational issues.\n\n## Azure Monitor to Fabric Eventhouse\n\nAzure Monitor to Fabric Eventhouse enables those scenarios. It consists of three main components.\n\n1. [Azure Monitor Agent (AME)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/agents/azure-monitor-agent-overview) collecting virtual machine telemetry.\n2. Azure Monitor [Data Collection Rules (DCR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/data-collection/data-collection-rule-overview) controlling AME and routing data to different destinations.\n3. [Fabric Eventhouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/eventhouse), Fabric RTI Analytical store for telemetry, this integration also works with [Azure Data Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview).\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-50-1024x196.png)Azure Monitor to Fabric Eventhouse\n\nVirtual Machines may be in Azure, On Premise, in other clouds, or a combination of the three. Currently, you can send the following Virtual Machines telemetry to Eventhouse.\n\n- Performance Counters\n- Windows Event Logs\n- Linux Syslog\n- IIS logs\n- Firewall logs\n- Custom Text Logs\n- Custom JSON logs\n- Prometheus Metrics\n\nEventhouse automatically creates tables. Schema management is built in! Once the telemetry is ingested in Eventhouse, you can use the data to:\n\n- Run ad hoc queries, graph queries & time series analytics.\n- Use Python in-query to do complex analytics.\n- Use Eventhouse as a source for visualization tools such as:\n- [Real Time Dashboards](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create?tabs=create-manual%2Ckql-database), Power BI, Grafana, and Tableau.\n- [Leverage Fabric Activator](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/data-activator/activator-introduction)\n\nYour data is seamlessly available through Fabric OneLake, enabling integration with all services connected to OneLake. For instance, you can execute Spark jobs on the VM telemetry data as needed. With Fabric, you have access not only to your telemetry data but also to all your enterprise information. This enables you to gain valuable insights by connecting server activities with sales performance.\n\n## Try it and give us feedback!\n\nTo get started, refer to the [Send virtual machine client data to Fabric and Azure Data Explorer (Preview)](https://aka.ms/AzMontoADX) documentation.",
