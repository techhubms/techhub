Unlocking Performance and Efficiency for Modern Data Workloads.\n\nThe **Fast Copy** feature in Dataflow is designed to dramatically reduce data movement latency. It minimizes data movement latency primarily through bulk loading and parallel processing by dividing large datasets into manageable chunks. This parallelism not only shortens the overall copy duration but also makes efficient use of both source and destination compute resources.\n\nNow, the Fast Copy capability can also be used to ingest large volume data from SQL database.\n\n**Note:** Fast Copy can use SQL database as a source only.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-4.gif)\n\n# Implementing Fast Copy in Dataflow\n\nStep1 – Create a new data flow by selecting Dataflow Gen2 item.\n\nStep 2 – Select options icon.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-32.png)\n\nStep 3 – Selecting the Options icon would show a popup like the image below. From the left menu select Scale under Dataflow and make sure ‘Allow use of fast copy connectors’ check box is checked.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-33.png)\n\nStep 4 – Select a SQL database as source and OneLake for destination to build your data flow.\n\nStep 5 – Publish and Run Dataflow.\n\n**Note**: Dataflow automatically switch to Fast copy when data size exceeds 100MB or 1 million rows.\n\nTo force the use of Fast Copy where the data is not 100MB or 1million rows, select the ‘Require fast copy’ option by right clicking the query.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-34.png)\n\nStep 6 – Navigate to Refresh history for Dataflow to verify if fast copy was used successfully. Select the start time for the run.\n\n![A white rectangular object with black lines AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-white-rectangular-object-with-black-lines-ai-ge-1.png)\n\nSelect an activity from Activities list.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-35.png)\n\nScreenshot example – ‘CopyActivity’ which means this data movement used Fast Copy.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-36.png)\n\nScreenshot example – ‘Allow use of fast copy connectors’ disabled. Engine shows ‘-‘ which means Dataflow didn’t use Fast Copy.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-37.png)\n\nThe Fast Copy feature in Dataflow reduces data movement latency and enables high-throughput, low-touch migrations. If your organization is striving for operational excellence and analytics at the speed of business, now is the time to explore Fast Copy in your Dataflow pipelines—and experience the future of data integration today.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Fast copy in Dataflow Gen2](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/dataflows-gen2-fast-copy) documentation.",
