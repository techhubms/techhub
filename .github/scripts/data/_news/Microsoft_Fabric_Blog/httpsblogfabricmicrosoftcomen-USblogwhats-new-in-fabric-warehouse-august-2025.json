  "EnhancedContent": "## Introduction\n\nWelcome to the August 2025 edition of *What’s New in Fabric Warehouse*. As summer winds down, despite August being a slower month, our team continued to deliver meaningful updates. We shipped several new features focused on enhancing data ingestion, improving the data management, and streamlining security. At the same time, much of our energy is going into preparing exciting announcements for FabCon Vienna — stay tuned for what’s coming next. Whether you’re optimizing workloads, building with SQL, or exploring new integrations, this roundup highlights improvements we think you’ll find valuable.\n\n## Quick Roundup of What’s New\n\n### Ingest, Load, and Sync Data\n\nGet data into Fabric from multiple sources with flexibility, automation, and governance.\n\n1. [**JSON Lines Support in OPENROWSET for Fabric Data Warehouse and Lakehouse SQL Analytics Endpoint (Preview)**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/public-preview-json-lines-support-in-openrowset-for-fabric-data-warehouse-and-lakehouse-sql-endpoints/)\nJSON Lines (JSONL) support in the [OPENROWSET(BULK)](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/openrowset-bulk-transact-sql?view=fabric) function for **** Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse **** and SQL Analytics Endpoints for Lakehouses is now available in preview. The [OPENROWSET(BULK](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/openrowset-bulk-transact-sql?view=fabric)) function allows you to query external data stored in the lake using well-known T-SQL syntax. With this update, you can now also query files in JSON Lines format, expanding the range of supported formats and simplifying access to semi-structured data.\n2. **Improvements in Copy job**\nCheck out these updates from Copy job that offer more granular control over data ingestion workflows in Fabric Warehouse. With features like [**Reset Incremental Copy** and **JSON Format Support**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/simplifying-data-ingestion-with-copy-job-reset-incremental-copy-auto-table-creation-and-json-format-support?ft=All), teams can streamline ingestion from semi-structured sources and simplify ETL setup. The new [**Copy job activity in pipelines (Preview)**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/now-in-public-preview-copy-job-activity-in-pipelines?ft=All) also brings visibility and orchestration flexibility, making it easier to manage Warehouse adjacent workflows. These enhancements reflect Microsoft Fabric’s ongoing commitment to simplifying data ingestion and boost performance for Warehouse users.\n3. [**Load data from network-protected Azure Storage accounts to Microsoft OneLake with AzCopy**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/load-data-from-network-protected-azure-storage-accounts-to-microsoft-onelake-with-azcopy?ft=All)\nAzCopy is a powerful, high-performance tool for moving data between Azure Storage and Microsoft OneLake, and it’s the preferred choice for large-scale transfers thanks to its simplicity and built-in optimizations. With recent updates, AzCopy now supports copying data from firewall-enabled Azure Storage accounts into OneLake using trusted workspace access. For Fabric Warehouse users, this removes a common networking roadblock and makes downstream ingestion with COPY INTO simpler and more secure.\n\n### Query, Transform, and Optimize for Insights\n\nWrite performant, reusable SQL and run queries fast – at scale.\n\n1. [**SHOWPLAN\\_XML set statement (Generally Available)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/set-showplan-xml-transact-sql?view=fabric)\nSHOWPLAN\\_XML is now Generally Available for the Fabric Data Warehouse and Lakehouse SQL analytics endpoint! The SHOWPLAN\\_XML set statement and its ‘Display estimated execution plan’ counterpart in SQL Server Management Studio are staple tools for investigating the details of a T-SQL queryplan: providing information on planned data movements, resource estimates, operator choices, and more.\n2. **[OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME TSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/object-schema-name-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17)**\nIntroducing the `OBJECT_SCHEMA_NAME` metadata scalar function in Fabric Warehouse to align with SQL Server behavior. This function takes an object ID and returns the schema name that owns the object—just like in SQL Server. For warehouse users, this means smoother migration of existing SQL scripts, easier compatibility across environments, and more consistent metadata operations when managing and analyzing objects.\n3. [**Introducing the Item History Page in Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics App (Preview)**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/26307?ft=All)\nThe new Item History page brings 30 days of compute usage to life with interactive visuals and slicers. You can quickly spot overall consumption trends, then drill into item-level details to see exactly which Warehouses or SQL analytics endpoints drive the highest CU usage. This makes it easier for capacity admins to identify heavy consumers, optimize workloads, and better forecast future needs.\n\n### Secure, Govern, and Manage with Confidence\n\nEnsure compliance, governance, and transparency for your data and models.\n\n1. [**Fabric workspace-level Private Link (Preview)**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/fabric-workspace-level-private-link-preview?ft=Data-warehouse:category)\nIn May 2024, we announced the [General Availability of Private Link for Fabric Tenants](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-general-availability-of-fabric-private-links-trusted-workspace-access-and-managed-private-endpoints/). Since then, we’ve heard feedback requesting more granular network security controls. [Private link for Fabric workspaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/security/security-workspace-level-private-links-overview) empowers your organization to secure your Fabric workspaces with fine-grained network isolation, allowing private, secure access from your virtual network — without traversing the public internet. With this update, customers can strengthen their security posture by isolating workspaces to trusted network perimeters and ensuring that inbound connections to the warehouse are only allowed from approved locations.\n2. [**Sunsetting Default Semantic Models – Microsoft Fabric**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/sunsetting-default-semantic-models-microsoft-fabric?ft=All)\nBased on your feedback, Fabric is retiring auto-generated semantic models in favor of giving you full control with custom semantic models—the ones you already know and trust. This change enhances transparency, improves governance, and provides greater flexibility in managing the lifecycle of your data assets.\n3. [**Streamlining Data Management with Workspace Collation Settings in Microsoft Fabric Warehouse and SQL Endpoint**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/streamlining-data-management-with-collation-settings-in-microsoft-fabric-warehouse-sql-analytics-endpoint/)\nWe’ve introduced workspace-level collation settings in Fabric Warehouse and SQL analytics endpoints to make migrations smoother and ensure consistency. Admins can now set a default collation across the workspace while still overriding it for specific items. Soon, item-level enhancements will provide even finer control with clearer options, snapshot consistency, and better shortcut management. Motherson, a global automotive supplier, has already seen the benefits – “*The change meant we could run most of our SQL Server scripts in Fabric Data Warehouse without significant rewrites, reducing friction in code conversion, validation, and deployment*“.\n\n### Enable AI, Copilot & Agentic Workflows\n\nEnable Copilot and AI to reason over data in Warehouse to deliver insights throughout your organization.\n\n1. [**Data Warehouse: Copilot & Data Agent**](https://asia.blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/data-warehouse-copilot-ai-skill?ft=Salil%20Kanade:author)\nFabric Warehouse now has an entry point to directly create data agents from warehouse in the SQL query editor! While Copilot provides real-time, interactive support for building schemas, generating SQL, and exploring data, Data Agent enables customizable, natural language-driven querying tailored to organizational needs. Together, they streamline workflows, improve collaboration between technical and non-technical users, and reduce errors by combining Copilot’s guidance with Data Agent’s context-aware query generation.\n2. [**Fabric Data Agents + Microsoft Copilot Studio: A New Era of Multi-Agent Orchestration**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/fabric-data-agents-microsoft-copilot-studio-a-new-era-of-multi-agent-orchestration/)\nThis preview introduces multi-agent orchestration by connecting Fabric Data Agents with Copilot Studio. Agents can now collaborate using Model Context Protocols (MCP), enabling richer, more complete responses across your warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint data.\n3. [**Empowering Agentic AI by Integrating Fabric with Azure AI Foundry**](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/empowering-agentic-ai-by-integrating-fabric-with-azure-ai-foundry/)\nFabric Data Agents now integrate with Azure AI Foundry, enabling organizations to build intelligent, domain-specific AI agents grounded in enterprise data. These agents can query across warehouses, sql endpoints, and semantic models to deliver contextual insights.\n\n### Build, Develop & Deploy with Modern Tooling\n\nEmpower developers and data engineers with CLI, IDE, and CI/CD tools for Fabric.\n\n1.
