This mark’s Microsoft’s first full participation in the Data Fabric Platforms Wave, and we believe it reflects the accelerating momentum of Microsoft Fabric since its launch in 2023.\n\nMicrosoft received the highest scores possible in 19 of 26 criteria, including key categories for Microsoft such as end-to-end data fabric, agentic AI, real-time integration, and unified data governance and security. Forrester noted in the report, “Microsoft’s forward-looking vision centers on delivering a unified, intelligent, and agentic data fabric that seamlessly integrates data management, advanced analytics, AI, and visualization at scale.”\n\nThe report recognized that Microsoft now offers the most comprehensive and end-to-end enterprise data fabric solution among hyperscalers. We provide a single, AI-powered foundation for data integration, data engineering, data warehousing, data science, real-time intelligence, and business intelligence—all built on OneLake, the industry’s first multi-cloud data lake for enterprises.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Image_Data-Fabric-Platforms-Q4-2025.png)\n\nForrester states that “agentic AI and advanced data intelligence are redefining data fabric,” signaling a new era of intelligent, connected, and AI-driven data platforms. With ongoing innovations and new capabilities, Microsoft Fabric is leading this transformation by embedding AI, automation, and governance deeply into its foundation.\n\nWith Copilot in Fabric, users can shape data and uncover insights through natural language. OneLake unifies all data in real time with built-in security and compliance, and embedded intelligence continuously surfaces patterns and relationships to accelerate discovery and decision-making.\n\nThat’s why [customers](https://www.microsoft.com/customers/search?sq=&amp;ff=story_product_categories%26%3EMicrosoft+365&amp;p=0&amp;so=story_publish_date+desc&amp;filters=product%3Aazure%2Fmicrosoft-fabric)such as LSEG, Lumen Technologies, Apollo Hospitals, and many others are using Microsoft Fabric to unify their data, modernize operations, and power AI-driven innovation—helping organizations turn data into action faster and build a stronger foundation for the future.\n\n## **Powered by our customers, partners, and community**\n\nWe believe the Forrester recognition reflects the collective effort of our vibrant Fabric community, including the customers, partners, and Microsoft MVPs who continue to shape the platform’s evolution.
