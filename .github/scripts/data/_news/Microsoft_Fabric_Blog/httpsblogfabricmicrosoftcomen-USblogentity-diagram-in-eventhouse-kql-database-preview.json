No more guessing where data comes from or where it goes, no more wondering what depends on what – just a clear view that helps you understand, troubleshoot, and design with confidence.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PRINT2-1024x547.png)The Entity Diagram allows you to visually explore relationships between database entities and helps you understand the data flow from the source to the destination\n\n## What is the Entity Diagram?\n\nThe Entity Diagram gives you a visual map of your database. It shows the relationships between your entities: tables, functions, materialized views, update policies, shortcuts, and continuous exports. It also shows cross-database relationships and Eventstream items that serve as data sources for tables, so you can instantly understand how data flows through your system.\n\nYou can view details, follow connections, and see what depends on what – all in one place.\n\n## View Ingestion Details\n\nYou can now see the number of records ingested for each table or materialized view. If the ingestion comes from an Eventstream, you can also see a node for the Eventstream item. If you click on the Eventstream, it will take you directly to it. You can track how data flows through update policies and how it is aggregated into materialized views, giving you a complete view of your data flow.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-61.png)View the ingestion details of each table and materialized view\n\n## Spot Schema Violations ****\n\nThe Entity Diagram also flags schema violations between entities, such as broken references from functions to tables or columns, or update policies referencing functions or source tables that no longer exist. This helps you quickly identify and fix issues that might disrupt your data flow.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-62.png)Schema violations help you identify inconsistencies or broken references between database entities\n\nWhether you are a developer, data engineer, or analyst, the Entity Diagram helps you understand your KQL database clearly. You can explore how tables, functions, materialized views, update policies, and other entities are connected, track data flow including the number of records processed through tables and passed along update policies or materialized views, identify schema violations, and make confident changes with a complete understanding of your database.\n\nTo learn more, check out the [View an entity diagram in KQL database (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/database-entity-diagram) documentation.",
