Today, Eventstream supports over 30 data sources, including streaming platforms, third-party services, database Change Data Capture (CDC), and public data feeds.\n\nWe have **two new connectors** that we’re excited to introduce to you — **HTTP** and **MongoDB CDC** — both inspired by your feedback. These new connectors make it even simpler to bring diverse, real-time data into Fabric RTI for real-time analytics. You can find both connectors in the **Real-Time Hub** starting today.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-29958-1-1.png)\n\n# HTTP Connector – From Fabric Ideas to Reality\n\nThe new **HTTP connector** provides a no-code, configurable way to continuously pull data from external platforms into Eventstream using standard HTTP requests. With a simple **HTTP GET** or **POST** request, you can now stream data into Eventstream without writing custom applications or managing complex client configurations. This greatly reduces development overhead while maintaining the scalability and reliability of Eventstream. For example, you can stream **real-time stock prices** from financial data providers such as *Yahoo Finance* to power real-time dashboards or anomaly detection in **Fabric RTI**.\n\nIn addition, the HTTP connector offers several **predefined public data feeds** to help you get started quickly. Simply select one of the **Example public APIs**, enter your API key, and Eventstream will automatically prefill the required HTTP headers and parameters — allowing you to focus on **data streaming and processing**, not configuration.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-29958-2-1.png)\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Add HTTP source to an eventstream](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-source-http) documentation.\n\nThe HTTP connector was inspired directly by a customer post in [Fabric Ideas] [Add HTTP REST / Webhook source and destination to Eventstream](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-Ideas/Add-HTTP-REST-Webhook-source-and-destination-to-Eventstream/idi-p/4697444). We value the community’s contributions—sharing ideas, providing feedback, and collaborating to continually enhance Eventstream. This release is a perfect example of how your input turns into real features — shaping the future of Eventstream together.\n\n# MongoDB CDC Connector – Inspired by Your Surveys\n\nWe also heard from many of you through our user surveys that MongoDB CDC support is critical for modern data streaming workloads. The new **MongoDB CDC connector** lets you stream real-time changes from any MongoDB instance—including **MongoDB Atlas** and **self-managed MongoDB**—directly into Eventstream. This enables seamless integration of CDC events into **Fabric RTI**, ensuring your analytics and dashboards stay up to date as your data evolves.\n\nIn addition to streaming ongoing database changes, the connector also supports **Snapshot mode**, which allows you to capture the initial snapshot of your MongoDB collections before real-time streaming begins—ensuring a complete and consistent view of your data from day one.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-29958-3-1.png)\n\nGet started by creating your MongoDB CDC connector today and following the setup guide: [Add MongoDB CDC source to an eventstream](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/add-source-mongodb-change-data-capture).\n\n# Share Your Ideas and Help Plan Eventstream’s Roadmap\n\nBoth of these connectors were built because of you – our users. Whether through Fabric Ideas or user surveys, your feedback directly drives the Eventstream roadmap.\n\nWe’d love to hear what you’d like to see next. ****\n\n**Join the conversation:** [Fabric Ideas – Microsoft Fabric Community](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-Ideas/idb-p/fbc_ideas/label-name/real-time%20intelligence%20%7C%20eventstream).\n\n**Post your ideas:** Suggest new features, improvements, or challenges you’d like to solve.\n\n**Vote and comment on existing ideas**: Browse, upvote and discuss ideas from the community.\n\n**Engage with other Fabric users**: Comment, share experience, help refine suggestions.\n\nYou can also fill out our **** [user survey](https://aka.ms/EventStreamSources) to share your top connector requests. Start sharing your ideas today — and let’s shape the future of Fabric Eventstream together.",
