  "EnhancedContent": "Microsoft OneLake is the unified data lake for your entire organization, built into Microsoft Fabric. It provides a single, open, and secure foundation for all your analytics workloads – eliminating data silos and simplifying data management across domains.\n\nThe preview of Microsoft OneLake Table APIs, a new way to programmatically manage and interact with your data tables in OneLake! These APIs open the door for developers and data engineers to integrate OneLake seamlessly into their workflows, enabling powerful automation and interoperability with open table formats.\n\n## OneLake table APIs\n\nOneLake is designed to be your organization’s single, unified data lake, and with the new Table API endpoint, you can seamlessly integrate your data into modern, open analytics workflows—making connectivity and management easier than ever.\n\n- List and fetch details of tables and schemas in OneLake programmatically.\n- Integrate with open-source ecosystems using familiar APIs.\n- Build custom applications and services that interact directly with your OneLake tables.\n\n## Starting with Apache Iceberg REST Catalog (IRC)\n\nIn this initial release, OneLake Table APIs support the [Iceberg REST Catalog (IRC) specification](https://iceberg.apache.org/rest-catalog-spec/), giving you a familiar and standards-based way to manage Iceberg tables. If you’re already using Iceberg, you can now connect your tools and applications to OneLake without changing your existing workflows.\n\nSoon, we’ll expand support to include Delta Lake operations, which will be covered in an upcoming update – so stay tuned!\n\n## Getting started\n\nGetting started is simple – and the documentation makes it even easier by providing examples for different tools, services, and libraries. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to configure your Iceberg REST Catalog clients to work with OneLake Table APIs – whether you’re using Snowflake, DuckDB, PyIceberg, or other Iceberg-compatible clients.\n\n1. Visit the documentation for [OneLake table APIs for Iceberg](https://aka.ms/OneLakeIrcDocs).\n2. Explore examples to see how to:\n- Set up your Iceberg REST Catalog client.\n- Connect to OneLake using the new APIs.\n- Perform common operations like creating and listing tables.\n3. Use these examples as inspiration to integrate OneLake into your workflows quickly and confidently.\n\n## Why it’s important\n\nBy supporting open standards like Apache Iceberg, OneLake continues to deliver on its promise of openness and flexibility. Whether you’re building analytics pipelines, machine learning workflows, or custom data applications, these APIs give you the tools to integrate OneLake into your ecosystem with ease.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThis is just the beginning. Soon, we’ll introduce Delta Lake support to our OneLake table APIs, enabling you to manage Delta tables with the same simplicity and openness. We’re also working on expanding API capabilities for additional operations, opening the door for more integration opportunities.\n\nThere’s much more to come as we grow the set of APIs – so stay tuned!\n\nHave feedback? Your input helps shape the future of OneLake. Try out the new table APIs and let us know what works well and what you’d like to see next. Share your feedback through [Microsoft Fabric Ideas](https://ideas.fabric.microsoft.com/).\n\nReady to dive in, refer to the [Use Iceberg tables with OneLake](https://aka.ms/OneLakeIrcDocs) documentation and start exploring the possibilities today!",
