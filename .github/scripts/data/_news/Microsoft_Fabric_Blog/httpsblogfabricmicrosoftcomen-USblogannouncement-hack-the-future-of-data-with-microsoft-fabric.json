Can others replicate the solution? | | Video Demonstration | Does the video clearly show how the solution works, especially its use of Microsoft Fabric + AI? |\n\n## What to Build: Hackathon Submission Categories\n\nMicrosoft Fabric has continued to evolve with new capabilities, and this hackathon is your opportunity to explore by building real-world solutions. The hackathon categories are designed to reflect areas of innovation across Fabric, providing you with multiple ways to apply and showcase your skills.\n\nAll winners will receive recognition on our blog platforms, social media and prizes!\n\n**1.** **Grand Prize Winner – $2500**\n\nThe best of the best! This category rewards the solution that meets all judging criteria, wows judge, has potential real-world value, and demonstrates innovative use of AI in Microsoft Fabric for Data Solutions.\n\n**2.** **Best AI Application Buit with Microsoft Fabric – $1500**\n\nA winning solution in this category uses Fabric’s advanced capabilities such as [Data Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-fabric-data-agents/), integration with AI Foundry, or [Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/work-smarter-with-copilot-in-microsoft-fabric/). It could also include building retrieval augmented generation (RAG) apps with the Eventhouse as your vector store, forecasting, anomaly detection, or custom ML models trained in Fabric. The goal is to show how Fabric’s AI capabilities can be combined to build something intelligent and grounded in real data.\n\n**3.** **Best use of Real-Time Intelligence (RTI) – $1500**\n\nA solution could connect to live data sources such as Event Hubs, Kafka, or CDC-enabled databases through Fabric’s Real-Time Hub. Key components of a strong RTI solution should include [real-time data processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/event-streams/overview?tabs=enhancedcapabilities), [real-time analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/create-query-set), [real-time monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create), [real-time alerting](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/user-flow-5), or any other real-time application within Microsoft Fabric. Using [RTI as a source of data](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/vector-database) for your AI application is also a great way to showcase the power of RTI. The focus is showing how real-time data can be used to make decisions, detect issues, and respond quickly.\n\n**4.** **Best Use of AI Features within Microsoft Fabric – $1500**\n\nThis category highlights how Fabric’s built-in AI tools can support automation and insight. A solution might use [Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/work-smarter-with-copilot-in-microsoft-fabric/) to build pipelines or generate visuals from natural language, Data Agents to enable conversational analytics, or AI Functions to summarize, classify, or translate data. AutoML and SynapseML may support model training. The aim is to show how Fabric’s AI features help users work faster, prepare data more easily, and uncover useful insights.\n\n**5.** **Best Analytics Solution with Azure Databases or Databases in Microsoft Fabric – $1500**\n\nA solution in this category might connect to Azure SQL, [Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-cosmos-db-nosql-fabric/), or Azure PostgreSQL using Mirroring, CDC, pipelines or Dataflows Gen2. It can also use Microsoft Fabric’s native databases: Fabric SQL Database for relational workloads and Fabric Cosmos DB Database for NoSQL scenarios. Optionally, the solution can showcase how these operational databases support developer applications by exposing data through GraphQL endpoints, and enabling flexible, client-driven queries. The solution may combine internal and external sources to deliver insights using Power BI, notebooks, Data Agents, or Copilot.\n\n**6.** **Best Use of Open Mirroring – $1500**\n\nA solution in this category may use [Open Mirroring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/open-mirroring) to replicate external data into Fabric. It shows how schema changes and updates are handled automatically. The solution may combine data from multiple systems and show how Fabric uses mirrored data for reporting, analysis, or AI tasks. The focus is on simplifying ingestion using open mirroring and making external data ready for analytics and insights.\n\n**Get ready to innovate, collaborate, and have fun**! Whether you’re building solo or with a team, we can’t wait to see what you create.\n\n[Join the Microsoft Fabric FabCon Hackathon](https://aka.ms/FabConHack) and start building with Microsoft Fabric today!\n\n[Full contest rules](https://aka.ms/FabConHack-Terms)",
