The new ArcGIS Maps workload empowers data professionals to visualize, explore, analyze, share location-based insights and integrate Esri’s authoritative data assets with their ArcGIS online service all seamlessly integrated with your organization’s data in OneLake.\n\n## What are ArcGIS Maps for Fabric?\n\nArcGIS Maps is a flexible, interactive mapping tool designed for visual data exploration and insight generation. It is an amalgamation of art and science. This is a tool that not only gives you the ability to work with data but also offers a rich graphical interface that allows users to tell a story. Unlike rigid workflows, ArcGIS Maps lets users adapt their analysis as new questions arise, making it easy to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers in their data.\n\n## End-to-End Integration in Microsoft Fabric\n\n- **OneLake Integration:** With the data in OneLake and access to the OneLake data Catalog users can select the most relevant dataset from across their organization’s data assets to use for their analysis.\n- **Data Engineering Workflows:** Can perform advanced geospatial analysis in Fabric notebooks leveraging of the scale of Spark’s parallel processing to prepare massive volumes of data, that get written back to OneLake and available for visualization and reporting using ArcGIS Maps solution.\n- **Power BI Integration:** Users can embed interactive maps in Power BI reports and organizational apps, making geospatial insights accessible to everyone.\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- Launch ArcGIS for Maps from the Fabric workload hub.\n- With a single click you can create your first web map item which behaves just like any Fabric artifact.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1.png)\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Effortless Data Onboarding\n\n- Load data into your web map item from OneLake or use Fabric’s built in data-connectivity experience to bring data in from hundreds of different sources.\n- ArcGIS for Maps automatically detects geospatial attributes in your dataset or prompts for coordinates, ensuring your data is ready for mapping.\n\n### Rich Visualization & Smart Mapping\n\n- Instantly plot geospatial data and visualize distributions—add cartographic polish, like visual filters that creates a vignette that offers qualitative context to your quantitative analysis.\n- Use smart mapping features like heat maps, color ramps, clustering, and binning to highlight differences, trends, and hotspots.\n- Switch between bubbles, pins, and heat maps with intuitive UI controls to make your data pop.\n\n![A screenshot of a map AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-map-ai-generated-content-may-be.png)\n\n![A screenshot of a map](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-map.png)\n\n### Advanced Analysis & Attribute Table\n\n- Ability to inspect data columns, view summary statistics, and rename fields for clarity before visualizing on a map.\n- Aggregate large volumes of data (e.g., Customer Sales across a geographic region), by using clustering that dynamically redraws itself as you add and remove data points. It creates and adjusts a histogram of the Sales data by region and as you adjust the cluster size, offering full interactively to explore details by clicking on map features.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer screen](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-screen.png)\n\n### Integration with ArcGIS Living Atlas & External Data\n\n- Enhance your maps by adding authoritative data and imagery from the ArcGIS Living Atlas or your own ArcGIS Online content to enrich your webmap.\n- Access population density, world terrestrial ecosystems, and many more third-party datasets to enrich your analysis.\n\n![A screenshot of a map](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-map-1.png)\n\n### AI-Powered Arcade Assistant\n\n- This is a scripting engine that augments the Smart mapping features to provide a natural language prompt interface to conduct additional analyses directly on the active web map data powered by a fine-tuned AI model.\n- Create HTML tables, summaries, and advanced calculations without deep scripting knowledge, thanks to the Arcade scripting language and AI assistant.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-computer.png)\n\n### Scalable Performance & Security\n\n- ArcGIS for Maps can handle hundreds of thousands of data points in browsers; from very large datasets, pre-processed with GeoAnalytics libraries in Spark Notebooks for optimal performance.\n- Share maps securely with users across your organization, securely with granular access control and consent management.\n\nReady to unlock the power of Geospatial Intelligence in Fabric?\n\nTry ArcGIS Maps for Microsoft Fabric today, [Microsoft Fabric Workload Hub](https://msit.powerbi.com/workloadhub/my?experience=power-bi)",
