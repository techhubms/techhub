Simply ask questions, refine visuals, and uncover insights – all without writing a single line of query language.\n\n## Instantly Explore Your Data\n\nReal-Time Dashboards already help you monitor key metrics and spot anomalies as they happen. Now, with Copilot built right in, you can go a step further – ask questions directly about your data and get instant, visual answers.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-58.png)\n\nWant to filter by region, compare timeframes, or find your top-performing products? Just type your question – for example:\n\n- ‘Show me the average temperature by device over the last 30 minutes.’\n- ‘Which regions have the highest number of delayed orders?’\n- ‘Compare total sales this month versus last month.’\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-57.png)\n\n## From Insight to Action – Seamlessly\n\nYou can continue the exploration and drill through the data in a focused view where you can save your insights as a new visual (tile) on your dashboard for quick access and sharing with your team. Each saved tile stays connected to your live data – so as the data updates, your visual does too.\n\nPrefer to adjust visuals manually? You can still use the Visual Options pane to fine-tune chart types, columns, or formatting to match your preferences.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-59.png)\n\n## Get Started\n\nTo try Copilot-assisted exploration:\n\n1. Open a Real-Time Dashboard in Fabric, and start chatting with your data using the Copilot pane on the right.\n\nor\n\n1. Use the inline Copilot prompt on any tile.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-2.jpg)\n\nYou can also try Copilot-assisted exploration from Real-Time Hub.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-60.png)\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Explore data in Real-Time Dashboard tiles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2339629) documentation.",
