With native support for multiple delivery styles, including bulk copy, incremental copy, and change data capture (CDC) replication, Copy job offers the flexibility to handle a wide range of scenarios—all through an intuitive, easy-to-use experience.\n\nThis update introduces several enhancements, including connection parameterization, expanded CDC capabilities, new connectors, and a streamlined Copy Assistant powered by Copy job.\n\n## Connection Parameterization with Variables Library for CI/CD (Preview)\n\nThis powerful capability helps automate your CI/CD processes by externalizing connection values. With it, you can deploy the same Copy job across multiple environments while relying on the Variable Library to inject the correct connection for each stage. Meaning, you can seamlessly use different data stores for development, testing, and production—without modifying your Copy job each time.\n\nCapabilities:\n\n- Parameterize connection using variables stored in the Variable Library in Fabric.\n- Promote Copy job seamlessly across environments—for example, from Dev to Test to Production—without hardcoding or manually editing data store connections.\n- Centralize configuration management, reducing duplication with a unified approach that makes it easier to manage configurations consistently across different environments\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CopyJobVariableLibraryForGif-1024x511.gif)\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [CI/CD for Copy Job in Data CI/CD for Copy job in Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/cicd-copy-job) documentation.\n\n## Data Replication from Fabric Lakehouse with Delta Change Data Feed (Preview)\n\nCopy job now supports Fabric Lakehouse Table connector with native CDC support. This connector enables efficient, automated replication of changed data—including inserts, updates, and deletes—from a Fabric Lakehouse via Delta Change Data Feed (CDF) to supported destinations. With this enhancement, your destination data stays continuously up to date—no manual refreshes, no extra effort—making your data integration workflows more efficient and reliable.\n\n- Replicate data changes seamlessly from your Lakehouse after processing is completed in OneLake.\n- Distribute updated data to supported destinations outside Fabric, such as SQL or Snowflake.\n- Save time and reduce complexity with automated, change-aware data movement.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-62.png)\n\nThis new CDC connector brings you the flexibility to keep downstream systems in multi-cloud environment in sync—ensuring your data is always accurate, timely, and ready for action.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Change data capture (CDC) in Copy Job (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/cdc-copy-job) documentation.\n\n## Merge data into Snowflake\n\nYou now have the ability to choose to merge changed data—including inserts, updates, and deletions—into Snowflake, when the data originates from any CDC source connectors such as Azure SQL DB, SQL Server, SQL MI, or Fabric Lakehouse tables.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-63-1024x502.png)\n\nWhat’s more, with Storage Integration support in the Snowflake connector for Copy job, you gain enhanced security through a Snowflake-assigned role. This eliminates the need to expose sensitive credentials and allows you to implement more secure authentication methods when connecting to Azure Blob Storage.\n\nFind more details in the [CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-storage-integration) or [Change data capture (CDC) in Copy Job](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/cdc-copy-job) documentation.\n\n## More Connectors, More Possibilities\n\nMore source and destination connections are now available, giving you greater flexibility for data ingestion with Copy job. We’re not stopping here—even more connectors are coming soon!\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-64-1024x607.png)\n\n### Newly supported connectors:\n\n- Folder\n- REST\n- SAP Table\n- SAP BW Open Hub\n- Amazon RDS for Oracle\n- Cassandra\n- Greenplum\n- Informix\n- Microsoft Access database\n- Presto\n\n### Incremental copy now supported for more connectors:\n\n- SAP HANA\n- MariaDB\n- MySQL\n- SFTP\n- FTP\n- Oracle cloud storage\n- Amazon S3 Compatible\n\nLearn more in [What is Copy job in Data Factory – Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/what-is-copy-job#supported-connectors)\n\n## Simplified Copy Assistant, Powered by Copy Job\n\nAccess the full power of Copy job by selecting Copy Assistant from a pipeline; eliminating the need for unnecessary parameterized foreach loops and copy activities as before for simple data copying. It also empowers you to benefit from all Copy job capabilities, including native incremental copy and Change Data Capture (CDC).\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-65-1024x600.png)\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [What is Copy job in Data Factory for Microsoft Fabric?](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/what-is-copy-job) documentation.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\nTo learn more, explore [Microsoft Fabric Copy Job](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/what-is-copy-job) documentation.\n\nSubmit your feedback on [Fabric Ideas](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-Ideas/idb-p/fbc_ideas/label-name/data%20factory%20%7C%20copy%20job) and join the conversation in [the Fabric Community](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Copy-job/bd-p/db_copyjob).\n\nTo get into the technical details, check out the [Fabric documentation](https://aka.ms/FabricBlog/docs).\n\nIf you have a question or want to share your feedback, please leave us a comment.",
