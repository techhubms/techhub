  "EnhancedContent": "Introducing staging support for Mirroring for Google BigQuery (Preview), a major enhancement that dramatically improves the speed and efficiency of initial data replication from Google BigQuery into Microsoft Fabric.\n\n## **Why Staging Matters**\n\nPreviously, initial replication of large datasets from BigQuery into Fabric could be time-consuming. With staging enabled, organizations are now seeing **performance improvements of over 90%** during the initial sync. For example, replicating 1.5 terabytes of data (over 6 billion rows) now only takes about 50 minutes, compared to a few days before.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/staging-1024x587.png)\n\n## **How it Works**\n\nStaging introduces an intermediate layer that streamlines the process of bringing large datasets into Fabric, this approach:\n\n- **Optimizes throughput** for bulk data ingestion.\n- **Reduces latency** for first-time connections.\n- **Ensures reliability** by minimizing errors during large-scale replication.\n\n## **Benefits for Your Analytics**\n\nWith faster data landing, teams can start analyzing and building on their BigQuery data in Fabric almost immediately. This means:\n\n- Accelerated time-to-insight for business-critical decisions.\n- Simplified workflows without complex ETL pipelines.\n- Improved reliability for cross-cloud analytics scenarios.\n\n## **What’s Next**\n\nTo learn more and get started with using Mirroring for GBQ, refer to the following resources.\n\n[Mirroring Google BigQuery in Microsoft Fabric (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/google-bigquery).\n\n[Tutorial: Set up mirroring for Google BigQuery (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/google-bigquery-tutorial).",
