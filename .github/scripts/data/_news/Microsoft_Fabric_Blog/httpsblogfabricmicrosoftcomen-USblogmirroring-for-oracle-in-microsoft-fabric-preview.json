Meaning your Oracle data is always fresh, instantly query able, and seamlessly integrated with the rest of your analytics stack—without the complexity of traditional ETL.\n\n## Integrating Oracle Data Seamlessly into OneLake\n\n[Mirroring in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/overview) is a low latency, near real-time data replication solution that continuously brings external data sources into OneLake, Fabric’s unified data lake. Unlike traditional ETL pipelines, mirroring requires no transformation or migration steps—data is simply and efficiently kept in sync. Your external data becomes instantly query able in the Fabric Data Warehouse view and is immediately available for analytics, AI/ML, and reporting scenarios across Power BI and other Fabric workloads.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-4.38.50 PM-1-1024x917.png)Mirrored Oracle source shown as a new tile in the artifact selection screen\n\n## Unlocking the Power of Mirroring Oracle in Fabric (Preview)\n\nOnce mirrored, Oracle data sits alongside other cloud data sources, enabling cross-cloud querying, unified semantic models, and integrated analytics within the Fabric ecosystem.\n\nWith Mirroring for Oracle, you can:\n\n- Continuously replicate tables from Oracle into OneLake with zero ETL.\n- Combine Oracle data with other mirrored sources like Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and SQL Server.\n- Run cross-cloud SQL queries directly in Fabric.\n- Build semantic models that unify data across your entire estate.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-03-at-4.41.12 PM-1024x550.png)Set up a new Mirrored Oracle via the connection creation page\n\n## What’s Supported?\n\n- Oracle on-premises (e.g., VM, Azure VM)\n- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\n- Oracle **** Exadata\n\nAutonomous databases are not supported at this time. Supported Oracle versions (versions 11 and above) must have LogMiner enabled. Database administrators may need to configure archived redo log files and supplemental logging to ensure successful replication.\n\nMore details on what permissions are needed, and the limitations can be found in the [What is Mirroring in Fabric](https://aka.ms/MirroringForOracleDocumentation) documentation.\n\n## Why This Changes the Game\n\nEnterprises rely on Oracle databases to run mission-critical workloads, but historically, unlocking insights across Oracle and other data systems has required costly, slow ETL pipelines. With Mirroring for Oracle, Microsoft Fabric removes this friction:\n\n- No ETL required – replicate data continuously and near real-time.\n- Unified data estate – Oracle data joins seamlessly with BigQuery, Snowflake, SQL Server, and more in OneLake.\n- Cross-cloud analytics – run SQL queries that span Oracle and other sources in a single Fabric warehouse.\n- End-to-end integration – Power BI dashboards, AI/ML models, and downstream pipelines can run on always-fresh Oracle data.\n- Faster time-to-insight – organizations can modernize their analytics stack without waiting for batch ETL jobs or migrations.\n\nThis is a major step in helping customers break down cloud silos and modernize their data strategy with Fabric.\n\nEarly adopters have highlighted just how much faster and easier insights have become with Oracle mirroring:\n\n*“CSX Transportation aims to leverage Mirroring for Oracle in Microsoft Fabric to manage and access operational data. We’re now able to stream real-time data from multiple on-premises Oracle systems across our rail network directly into Fabric—eliminating the complexity of traditional ETL pipelines. With billions of rows ingested and refreshed hourly, we finally have a unified, scalable data foundation to drive predictive analytics, reporting, and machine learning. This has significantly accelerated our ability to make data-driven decisions across the organization”* – Chandra Bhowmick, CSX\n\n## Dive Deeper and Learn More\n\nMirroring for Oracle is just the beginning. This capability will continue to evolve based on your feedback. Our roadmap includes enhancements to user experience, telemetry and monitoring, and performance and scalability—all with the goal of making mirroring even more seamless and powerful.\n\n- Explore the [Mirroring for Oracle Overview](https://aka.ms/MirroringForOracleDocumentation) documentation.\n- Review [Oracle mirroring prerequisites and setup guidance](https://aka.ms/MirroringForOracleDocumentation).\n\nWith Mirroring for Oracle in preview, Microsoft Fabric takes another leap toward a unified, real-time, cross-cloud data platform. Your Oracle data doesn’t have to live in a silo—it can power insights alongside all your other cloud data, seamlessly and instantly.",
