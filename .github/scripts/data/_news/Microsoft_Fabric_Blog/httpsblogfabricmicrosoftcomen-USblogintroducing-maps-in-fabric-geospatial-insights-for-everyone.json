Whether you’re monitoring supply chains, tracking last-mile deliveries, or analyzing campaign performance, location adds context, reveals patterns, and helps you tell the story behind the numbers. With the new Map item geospatial insights are now built into the Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence workload – bringing location-aware analytics into the same unified experience where you manage structured, unstructured, and streaming data.\n\n## Why Maps in Fabric?\n\nReal-Time Intelligence in Microsoft Fabric is designed to help organizations move from reactive to proactive operations, powered by AI and real-time data. The new Map item is a foundational part of this transformation. It provides:\n\n- Contextual Awareness: Maps let you analyze and visualize data not just by ‘when’ events happen, but also ‘where’. This spatial context is critical for understanding operations, optimizing logistics, and making smarter decisions in the moment.\n- Integrated Experience: As part of Real-Time Intelligence, Maps integrates seamlessly with other Fabric capabilities – Eventhouse for real-time event monitoring and Lakehouse for historical records. You can combine spatial and temporal data to uncover patterns across time and space.\n- Geospatial Insights for Everyone: Maps in Fabric are built for data citizens, analysts, and business users. With intuitive, no-code experiences, anyone can build map-centric applications, monitor live operations, and share insights across the organization.\n\n## See It in Action: Zava’s Journey with Maps and Real-Time Intelligence\n\nDuring the FabCon Europe keynote, Zava – a global retailer – used Maps in Fabric to unify historical and real-time data across their business.\n\nGlobal View: Visualize worldwide locations and distribution lines using Lakehouse data.\n\n![Zava's global locations and distribution lines stored in Lakehouse and visualized on a map.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slide1-1024x576.jpg)\n\nRegional Insights: Layer revenue data by district to reveal geographic sales patterns.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slide3-1-1024x576.jpg)\n\nReal-Time Monitoring: Track online orders streaming into Eventhouse to show trends as they happen.\n\n![Real-time map for online order analysis using data in Eventhouse.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slide3-1024x576.jpg)\n\nFleet Tracking: Connect Maps to real-time telemetry to monitor delivery routes and your fleet.\n\n![Real-time map with delivery routes and delivery vehicles.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slide4-1024x576.jpg)\n\nIn-Store Analytics: Visualize footfall and dwell time to optimize store layouts.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slide6-1024x576.jpg)\n\nFrom global operations to local engagement, Zava’s teams used Maps in Fabric to add location context and uncover the stories behind the numbers.\n\n## How it Works: Build Maps in Minutes\n\nMaps in Fabric are intuitive and flexible – so you can turn raw data into rich geospatial insights in just a few clicks.\n\nHere’s how you get started with the new Map item:\n\n1. Connect Your Data: Select historical records from Lakehouse or real-time streams from Eventhouse.\n2. Select Your Layers: Overlay multiple datasets and customize styles.\n3. Optimize Performance: For large data volumes Maps create vector tiles.\n4. Visualize & Explore: Use clustering, aggregation, and styling to reveal patterns.\n5. Monitor in Real Time: Watch your map come alive with streaming data.\n6. Share your Insights: Distribute map-centric solutions across your organization.\n\n![Map editor.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Slide8-1024x576.jpg)\n\nWhether you’re visualizing historical trends or reacting to real-time events, location-aware insights are just a few clicks away.\n\nConnect your data, choose your layers, and start exploring – because everything happens somewhere. Happy Mapping!\n\nFor additional resources check out the [Create a map](https://aka.ms/StartWithFabricMaps) documentation.",
