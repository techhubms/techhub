  "EnhancedContent": "Say goodbye to complex syntax—Copilot now makes building pipeline expressions as easy as having a conversation. Introducing a new Copilot capability (Preview) that transforms how you create and understand pipeline expressions in Fabric Data Factory.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nPipeline expressions are powerful tools for dynamic data movement and transformation. But writing them often means memorizing syntax, debugging errors, and spending time you’d rather use elsewhere. This new Copilot feature changes that by making expression building intuitive, conversational, and accessible to everyone.\n\n![Copilot Pipeline Expression Builder experience](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-69-1024x951.png)\n\n### What’s New with Pipeline Expression Builder Copilot?\n\nYou’ll find Copilot built right into the Pipeline Expression Builder, so you can chat with it just like you do with other Data Factory Copilot experiences.\n\nHere’s what you can do:\n\n1. **Generate Expressions Using Natural Language:** Instead of writing complex syntax, simply describe what you need.\n\n- *‘Get the current date in UTC.*‘\n- *‘Add 7 days to the pipeline start time.*‘\n\nCopilot instantly translates your intent into accurate pipeline expressions—no guesswork required.\n\n![Generate expression skill in Copilot](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-72-758x1024.png)The following prompt was used in this Copilot example: Get the current date and time in UTC. Convert the current UTC time to Central Standard Time (CST). Format the converted CST time into a string like 2025/07/10. Finally, concatenate the string ‘ContosoSales\\’ with the formatted date.\n\nWith Copilot, you’re always in control! You can choose to Accept, Discard, or even retry a prompt. If you Accept the prompt, Copilot will replace the contents in the expression builder with the generated content.\n\n![Accepted content gets generated into the expression builder.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-73-1024x902.png)\n\n2. **Explain Existing Expressions in Plain Language**: Ever looked at an expression and thought, *‘What does this even do*?’. Now, you can ask Copilot to explain it in clear, contextual terms:\n\n- *Expression:* `addDays(pipeline().TriggerTime, 7)`\n- *Copilot explains:* ‘This adds 7 days to the time when the pipeline was triggered’.\n\nNo more decoding syntax—just clarity.\n\n![Explain expression skill in Pipeline Copilot](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-70-1024x603.png)\n\n### Why You’ll Love it\n\n- **Boost productivity:** Reduce manual coding and speed up pipeline development.\n- **Minimize errors:** Let Copilot handle syntax so you can focus on logic.\n- **Empower everyone:** Whether you’re a seasoned developer or new to Data Factory, this feature makes expression building approachable.\n\n### How it Works\n\n1. Open the Pipeline expression builder in your pipeline activity. You can navigate to the Pipeline expression builder; select view in expression builder or add dynamic content in your activity.\n\n![View in expression builder](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-74-1024x602.png) ![Add dynamic content](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-75-1024x590.png)\n\n2. Select the Copilot chat panel.\n\n![Inline Copilot chat](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-76.png)\n\n3. Type your request in natural language—Copilot will generate or explain the expression for you.\n\n4. Insert the expression directly into your pipeline.\n\n### Try It Today\n\nWe’d love your feedback! Explore the feature and share your thoughts with us.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Explain Pipeline Expressions with Copilot](https://aka.ms/CopilotPipelineExpression) documentation.",
