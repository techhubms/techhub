  "EnhancedContent": "Welcome to the September edition of the Fabric Influencers Spotlight, a recurring monthly post here to shine a bright light on the places on the internet where Microsoft MVPs & Fabric Super Users are doing some amazing work on all aspects of Microsoft Fabric.\n\nThe Microsoft Fabric Community team has created the Fabric Influencers Spotlight to highlight and amplify blog posts, videos, presentations, and other content related to Microsoft Fabric. We’ve cultivated submissions from members of Microsoft MVPs & Fabric Super Users from the Fabric community that cover the Fabric Platform, Data Engineering & Data Science in Fabric, Data Warehousing, Power BI, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Integration, Fabric Administration & Governance and Databases.\n\nMicrosoft Most Valuable Professionals, or MVPs, are technology experts who utilize their deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services to bring together diverse platforms, products, and solutions, to solve real world problems, and to bring ‘leading edge’ content to the data community. To learn about the Microsoft MVP Award and to find MVPs, visit the [official website](https://mvp.microsoft.com/).\n\nFabric Super Users are the heroes of the Fabric Community. They contribute helpful answers, write informative blog posts, post data stories and are key contributors to the Fabric product via engagement with the product group. To learn more about the Super User program, visit the [official website](https://aka.ms/SuperUsers).\n\n## Power BI\n\n### Jon Vöge, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonvoge/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog Post: [Comparing write-back options for Power BI/Fabric: Translytical Task Flows vs Power Apps](https://downhill-data.com/2025/09/09/comparing-write-back-options-for-power-bi-fabric-translytical-task-flows-vs-power-apps/)\n\nTranslytical Task Flows present a Fabric Native way to perform write-back in Power BI. But how does the feature stack up against other write-back solutions like Power Apps? This blog compares the two solutions on parameters like end user experience, developer experience, solution architecture and cost to crown a winner.\n\n### Parul Sagar\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog Post: [Recursive Hierarchy Traversal in Moodle LMS Using Power Query](https://medium.com/@cseprs_54978/recursive-hierarchy-traversal-in-moodle-lms-using-power-query-19766570f67a)\n\nDefining the recursive approach for LMS analytics, where understanding lineage and roll-ups is essential for course reporting, access rights, and faculty-level performance metrics.\n\n## Data Engineering\n\n### Inturi Suparna Babu, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inturi-suparna-babu-312b59270/)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog Post: [How to Build and Orchestrate a Scalable Data Pipeline in Microsoft Fabric? A Step-by-Step Guide](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Factory-Community-Blog/How-to-Build-and-Orchestrate-a-Scalable-Data-Pipeline-in/ba-p/4801197)\n\nIn this blog, we’ll walk through how to build a scalable data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric—covering every stage from data ingestion to automation.\n\n### Amit Chandak, [Twitter](https://x.com/amitchandak78), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amitchandak78/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog Post: [Why Microsoft Fabric is the Ultimate Choice for Data Engineers](https://amitchandak.medium.com/why-microsoft-fabric-is-the-ultimate-choice-for-data-engineers-84c370389d8a)\n\nIn today’s fast-moving, data/AI-driven world, organizations face a huge challenge: wrangling messy data environments while keeping things scalable, accurate, and cost-effective. They also need insights to come quickly and be accessible to everyone, whether you’re a tech wizard or not. That’s where Microsoft Fabric comes in. Since its public preview launch, this enterprise-ready, SaaS-based platform has emerged as a game-changer for data/AI engineers, offering a unified, end-to-end environment that simplifies the chaos and powers up AI/analytics like never before.\n\n## Data Science\n\n### Sahir Maharaj, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahir-maharaj/)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog Post: [The Data Scientist’s Guide to Model Metrics in Microsoft Fabric](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Science-Community-Blog/The-Data-Scientist-s-Guide-to-Model-Metrics-in-Microsoft-Fabric/ba-p/4798934)\n\nIn this edition, we will explore model evaluation metrics. By the time you’re through, you’ll know how to make sense of precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and MCC in plain language, and more importantly, when to reach for each one depending on the problem in front of you. I’ll also show you how to implement these metrics in Python using scikit-learn, and how to bring them to life with visualizations like precision-recall and ROC curves.\n\n## Fabric Platform, Administrative & Governance\n\n### Nicky van Vroenhoven, [Twitter](https://x.com/NickyvV), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickyvanvroenhoven)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog Post: [Fabric Quality of Life Update: No More Default Semantic Models!](https://www.nickyvv.com/2025/08/fabric-quality-of-life-update-no-more-default-semantic-models.html)\n\nMicrosoft Fabric is phasing out the automatic generation of Default Semantic Models; New warehouses, lakehouses, SQL databases, and mirrored artifacts will no longer come with one, and by December 2025, all existing default models will be detached and reclassified as regular, user-managed models. This shift pushes responsibility back onto teams to explicitly create, govern, and assign ownership to semantic models\n\n### Kevin Chant, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/kevin-chant)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog Post: [Mystery of the fabric-cicd authentication that never was](https://www.kevinrchant.com/2025/09/01/mystery-of-the-fabric-cicd-authentication-that-never-was/)\n\nIn this post I cover the mystery of the fabric-cicd authentication that never was. To help others who experience similar issues with fabric-cicd.\n\n**Thanks for reading & we’ll see you next month!**\n\nThat’s all for this month’s spotlight on the Microsoft Fabric Influencers. We wanted to extend our thanks to the MVPs and Super Users whose expertise continues to enrich the Fabric community. We anticipate the innovative ideas and valuable insights that will emerge in the coming months and invite everyone to stay engaged here on the Fabric Community Platform. Together, we will continue to deliver knowledge and collaboration that empowers every member of our community to achieve more. Stay tuned!",
