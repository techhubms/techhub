  "EnhancedContent": "Introducing the Secure tab in the OneLake catalog—your central place to understand and manage access across Fabric items. From a single view, you can workspace roles with the View users experience and inspect or modify role OneLake security roles with View security roles. The Secure tab brings a streamlined view for governance teams and workspace owners to quickly validate permissions and tighten least‑privilege access.\n\n## View users\n\nUse the View users page in the secure tab to quickly understand workspace roles and permissions. Because most organizations span dozens or even hundreds of workspaces, the page starts with a ‘Workspace filter’. Use the multi‑select control to scope your view to just the areas you manage today—flip between business domains, clear the selection, or apply a focused subset for deep reviews. Additional filters at the top let you quickly narrow your search to specific roles or user types.\n\nOn View users, you’ll see the user’s name plus a counter of which roles they hold from the list of selected workspaces. This is perfect for quarterly access reviews or for quickly answering questions like ‘who can manage data?’ across sensitive folders and tables.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-12.png)\n\n## View security roles\n\nSwitching to View security roles, you get OneLake security role definitions across workspaces and item types consolidated in one place. For example, opening Test Role in the NorthWind Test lakehouse shows it grants the Read permission on the Customers table. From here, you can adjust scope by adding or removing paths, and you can review or update Members without leaving the catalog.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-13.png)\n\nMany roles also include ‘Row‑Level Security (RLS)’ or Column-level security (CLS) for restricting access to rows or columns in a table. You can view or edit the RLS and CLS definitions inline from the catalog, making it easy to author, validate, and standardize data‑level protections across your estate.\n\nFurther, the entire role can be managed from this page as well. Whether creating or deleting roles across your estate, role management is now consolidated into a single experience in the OneLake catalog.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-14.png)\n\n## Get started!\n\nOpen the OneLake catalog, switch to the Secure tab, and take control of your data security.",
