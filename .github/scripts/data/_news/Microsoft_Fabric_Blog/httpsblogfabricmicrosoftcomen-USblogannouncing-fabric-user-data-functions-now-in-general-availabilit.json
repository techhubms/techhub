  "EnhancedContent": "During preview, thousands of users have leveraged created functions to embed their business logic into their Fabric ecosystem. We have seen sophisticated solutions for a wide variety of use cases from data engineering, with [Data pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/create-functions-activity-data-pipelines) and [Notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#user-data-function-udf-utilities), to Translytical applications using [Power BI reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/translytical-task-flow-overview).\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-24-1024x541.png)Create, connect and run your business logic with User Data Functions\n\n## Benefits of using User Data Functions\n\n- Reusability: Create functions that can be used across different parts of your data architecture.\n- Customization: Use Python and PyPI libraries to write powerful functions that are tailored to your needs.\n- Encapsulation: Write code that abstracts complex processes into single function calls.\n- External connectivity: Use your functions to make requests outside of Fabric or call your functions from external systems using their public endpoints.\n\n## Key features of User Data Functions\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/video_1_edit.gif)Create and edit your functions using the in-browser tooling or the VS Code extensions.\n- Create functions using your choice of the in-browser portal or pro-developer tools with [VS Code.](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/create-user-data-functions-vs-code) Edit, test and publish your functions with [end-to-end functionality](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/test-user-data-functions) with your tooling of choice.\n- Connect your functions to your [Fabric data sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/connect-to-data-sources), including Fabric SQL Database, Fabric Warehouse, Fabric Lakehouse and Mirrored databases.\n- Run your functions from wherever you need them. You can use [Power BI reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/translytical-task-flow-overview), Fabric [Data pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/create-functions-activity-data-pipelines) or [Fabric Notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/notebook-utilities#user-data-function-udf-utilities). You can also use the public endpoint to [invoke your functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/tutorial-invoke-from-python-app) from a client application of your choice.\n\n## What’s new in General Availability?\n\n- User Data Functions is now available for all tenants without the need to turn on the feature in the Admin portal.\n- The[region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/admin/region-availability)for User Data Functions has been expanded.\n- Visual Studio Code extensions for [Microsoft Fabric](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabric.vscode-fabric) and [User Data Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabric.vscode-fabric-functions) are Generally Available.\n- The following features have been announced recently:\n- Test your functions using [Develop mode](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/test-and-validate-your-functions-with-develop-mode-in-fabric-user-data-functions-preview/).\n- Generate an [OpenAPI specification](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/openapi-specification-code-generation-now-available-in-fabric-user-data-functions/) for your functions.\n- [Pandas and async functions](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/user-data-functions-now-support-async-functions-and-pandas-dataframe-series-types) support.\n\nTest capability in Develop mode is now available in all tenants with billing in audit mode. Please review the [Fabric operations documentation article](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/fabric-operations#fabric-user-data-functions) to understand the billing implications for using this feature.\n\n## More resources\n\n- [Get started with your first User Data Functions item](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/create-user-data-functions-portal).\n- [Fabric User Data Functions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-overview).\n- [Service details and limitation documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-service-limits).",
