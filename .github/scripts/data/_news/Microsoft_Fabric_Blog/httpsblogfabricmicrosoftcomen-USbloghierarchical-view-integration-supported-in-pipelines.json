Hierarchical View for Pipelines in Monitoring Hub, is designed to give you complete visibility and control over your pipeline runs.\n\n![Screenshot of Fabric's Monitoring Hub showcasing Upstream and Downstream runs for Pipelines.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-63-1024x609.png)\n\n## Why Hierarchical View Matters\n\nPipelines often involve multiple jobs that depend on each other. When something goes wrong, understanding the upstream and downstream impact is critical. Without a clear view, troubleshooting can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n\nHierarchical View solves this by providing a structured, layered representation of your pipeline runs. This means you can:\n\n- **Navigate across layers of jobs:** Seamlessly explore upstream and downstream jobs within a pipeline. No more guessing which job triggered what—everything is mapped out for you.\n- **Trace dependencies with confidence:** Quickly locate related jobs and understand how they connect. This visibility helps you identify root causes and prevent cascading failures.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Navigate to Monitoring Hub**: Open the Fabric Monitoring Hub page.\n\n2. **Enable Hierarchical Columns**: In the Column Options, toggle on Upstream and Downstream runs.\n\n![Toggling on Upstream run and Downstream runs from Column Options in the Monitoring Hub page.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-65-1024x609.png)\n\n3. **Explore Your Pipeline Runs**: Once enabled, you’ll see a clear hierarchy of your pipeline runs, showing which jobs triggered others and how they relate.\n\n![Monitoring Hub showing Upstream run and Downstream runs.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-66-1024x617.png)\n\nYou can toggle into the Upstream run / Downstream runs of each of your runs. Upstream run details, Downstream runs details, and the Monitoring Hub page are all connected, making navigation easy!\n\n![Upstream run details](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-67-1024x264.png)The image above showcases upstream run details. ![Downstream run details](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-68-1024x259.png)Downstream run details.\n\n## Benefits of Hierarchical View\n\nImagine you have a pipeline that refreshes a dataset and then triggers a downstream job to update a dashboard. If the dashboard update fails, Hierarchical View lets you:\n\n- Instantly see that the failure was caused by the downstream job.\n- Check whether the upstream dataset refresh completed successfully.\n- Drill into details without switching between multiple pages.\n\n### This saves time and reduces operational risk.\n\n- **Faster troubleshooting**: Identify issues and their impact in seconds.\n- **Better visibility**: Understand the full picture of your orchestration workflows.\n- **Confidence in operations**: Monitor complex pipelines without guesswork.\n\n## Learn More\n\nReady to try it?
