Now the wait is finally over!\n\n[Private link for Fabric workspaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/security/security-workspace-level-private-links-overview) empowers your organization to **secure your Fabric workspaces with fine-grained network isolation**, allowing private, secure access from your virtual network — without traversing the public internet.  From financial institutions requiring stringent data privacy measures to healthcare providers safeguarding patient information, private endpoints can provide the security and privacy needed to comply with industry regulations while maintaining trust.\n\n# What is workspace-level Private Link\n\nAzure Private Link is a feature designed to enhance security by enabling private connectivity between Azure services and virtual networks. With this new capability, you can now configure Azure Private Link connections at the workspace level in Microsoft Fabric.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Picture2.png)Private Link at the workspace level\n\n## Key benefits\n\n- **Enhanced enterprise-grade security**:\n\nBy leveraging private endpoints, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with exposing their Fabric workspaces to the public internet. This setup ensures that network or data traffic remains within the secure confines of the organization’s virtual network, reducing the potential for malicious attacks.\n\n- **Granular control**:\n\nThe feature makes it possible to control private network access **per workspace** instead of at the tenant level. This allows you to apply differentiated controls across business units, dev/test/prod environments, data domains, or projects.\n\nLearn more about this feature [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/security/security-workspace-level-private-links-overview).\n\nFabric portal access to workspaces via workspace-level private link is not supported in this release. You can find more information about what is supported and other limitations [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/security/security-workspace-level-private-links-support).\n\n# Implementing Fabric workspace-level Private Link\n\nImplementing Fabric workspace-level private link involves several steps, including the creation of private endpoints within your virtual network.\n\nMain Steps:\n\n1. As a Fabric tenant admin, enable the  “[Configure workspace-level inbound network rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/security-workspace-enable-inbound-access-protection)**”** tenant setting in the Fabric admin portal.\n2. As a Fabric workspace admin\n- Go to the Azure portal and create a Private Link service which refers to the Fabric workspace .\n- Configure private endpoints for the Private Link service you created for the Fabric workspace.\n- Test the connectivity from a virtual machine in the same virtual network as the private endpoint to confirm successful connectivity.\n- Restrict inbound public access for the workspace.\n\nDetailed instructions are available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/security/security-workspace-level-private-links-set-up).\n\n# Looking ahead\n\nWorkspace-level private link for  Fabric workspaces is a significant step towards a more secure and private cloud computing environment. We will continue to further enhance and refine this feature based on your feedback and evolving security needs.\n\nGive these features a try and let us know how we can improve the experience and make Fabric even more secure!",
