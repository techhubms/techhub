Together, these capabilities enable Fabric customers to break down the silos within data estates to unlock the true value of data no matter where it resides.\n\nFor enterprise customers, SAP represents one of the most valuable data sources, and integration of SAP data with other non-SAP data estates is one of the top requirements we hear from them. Consequently, we continue to deliver innovations in the area of SAP data integration to provide our customers with easy-to-use and yet powerful ways to leverage the capabilities of Microsoft Fabric on their SAP data.\n\nWe’ve made two major enhancements – Mirroring for SAP Datasphere and Copy Job support for SAP Datasphere – both now available in preview. These new capabilities enable customers to mirror and operationalize SAP data into Fabric OneLake with minimal latency. With their SAP and non-SAP data combined in OneLake, customers can create dashboards, run advanced analytics or leverage Fabric Data Agents in Microsoft Fabric to maximize the business value of their unified data estate.\n\n## Mirroring for SAP Datasphere: Zero-ETL, Near Real-Time Replication of your SAP data into OneLake\n\nMirroring in Microsoft Fabric delivers a truly game-changing, no-ETL experience—empowering you to replicate SAP data into OneLake with full fidelity and minimal operational overhead.
