That’s why Microsoft Fabric now allows Copy Job to work seamlessly with the Virtual Network (VNET) Data Gateway, providing a simple, secure, and high-performance way to move data between private networks and Fabric without ever exposing it to the public internet.\n\n## Why Security-First Data Movement Matters\n\nEnterprises in finance, healthcare, government, and other regulated industries often store mission-critical data in private networks. These networks are locked down for good reason — they’re designed to keep sensitive information safe from unauthorized access.\n\nMoving that data for analytics, machine learning, or reporting can be tricky. Without the right approach, you might have to:\n\n- Open public endpoints (increasing risk of attacks).\n- Set up complex VPN tunnels that are hard to manage.\n- Deal with performance bottlenecks due to indirect routes.\n\nVNET Data Gateway solves these challenges by acting as a secure bridge between your private data sources and Microsoft Fabric — and now, Copy Job can use it natively.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1024x247.png)\n\n## How Copy Job Works with VNET Data Gateway\n\n1. Gateway Inside Your VNET – Install and configure the VNET Data Gateway inside your Azure Virtual Network.\n2. Direct, Private Connection – When you run a Copy Job, it routes data through the gateway, keeping it inside your private network path.\n3. No Public Exposure – Data never leaves your secure perimeter or travels over the public internet.\n\n## Benefits at a Glance\n\n- End-to-End Security – Keep sensitive data within your private network at all times.\n- High Performance – Leverage private endpoints or ExpressRoute for faster, more reliable transfers.\n- Operational Simplicity – Works with existing Copy Job configurations, so there’s no steep learning curve.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWhether you’re migrating to Microsoft Fabric or running ongoing data integration workflows, combining Copy Job with VNET Data Gateway ensures your data movement is private, compliant, and fast.\n\n- Follow our [VNET Data Gateway setup guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/data-integration/vnet/create-data-gateways?toc=%2Ffabric%2Fdata-factory%2Ftoc.json) to configure your environment.\n- [Create your first Copy Job](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/create-copy-job) in Fabric and select the VNET Data Gateway for your source connection.\n- Start moving your data securely — without sacrificing speed or simplicity.\n\nWith Copy Job + VNET Data Gateway, you don’t have to choose between security and performance — you get both, built-in.",
