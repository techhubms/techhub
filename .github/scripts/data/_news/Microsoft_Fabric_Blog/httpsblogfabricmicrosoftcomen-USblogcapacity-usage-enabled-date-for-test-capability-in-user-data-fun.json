  "EnhancedContent": "[User Data Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-overview) is an item that allows you to create fully managed Python functions to run on Fabric. You can use this item to embed your business logic in your Fabric data architectures across all the different [integrations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-overview#fabric-integrations), such as Fabric data sources, Power BI reports, Pipelines, Notebooks, and more.\n\nThe use of the Test capability in Fabric User Data Functions operations will use your Fabric capacity beginning October 27th.\n\n## What is the test capability in Fabric User Data Functions?\n\nIn August, we introduced [the test capability in Develop mode (preview)](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/test-and-validate-your-functions-with-develop-mode-in-fabric-user-data-functions-preview/) to test your User Data Functions directly from your browser. This feature has helped users have faster development iteration cycles, saving them time and increasing the quality of their published functions for other Fabric items to consume.\n\n## What is the capacity usage model for this feature?\n\nWhen you test your functions with this capability, you start a session where you can modify and run your code immediately without having to publish your functions. This session has a [timeout of 15 minu](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-service-limits#service-limits)[tes,](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-service-limits#service-limits) and it is extended every time you run a new test. The total session time is then reported under the [User Data Functions Portal Test](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/fabric-operations#fabric-user-data-functions) operation name in terms of seconds. When this feature was first introduced in preview in August 19th, the User Data Functions Portal Test operation was reported but it did not result in any capacity usage.\n\n## What is changing in General Availability?\n\nWith the [General Availability release of Fabric User Data Functions](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-fabric-user-data-functions-now-in-general-availability/), the test capability is now also generally available. Starting on October 27th, the User Data Functions Portal Test operation will start using the capacity reported. There will be no changes to the details or rate in CU/s of the User Data Functions Portal Test operation with this change. This operation will continue to be reported in the Capacity Metrics application as usual.\n\n## Resources\n\n- To learn more about the User Data Functions Portal Test operation, refer to the [Fabric Operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/fabric-operations#fabric-user-data-functions) documentation.\n- Learn more about how to validate your functions in the [Test capability](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/test-user-data-functions) documentation.\n- To learn more about the current service details, refer to the [Service details and limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-service-limits) documentation.",
