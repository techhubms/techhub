The maximum size for large string or binary columns depends on the file format:\n\n- **Parquet** – up to **16 MB per cell**, **1 GB total row size**.\n- **CSV** – up to **1 MB per cell**, **16 MB total row size**.\n\nOnce ingested, you can apply any string operations on your data—such as comparisons with **LIKE** or extracting information using **JSON functions**—just as you would on **VARCHAR(N)** or **VARBINARY(N)** columns.\n\nPerformance is influenced by the **amount of data processed**, not by the declared column type.\n\n## Large string or binary values in SQL analytics endpoint for mirrored items\n\nThe **SQL analytics endpoint** for **mirrored items** (such as Azure SQL Database or Cosmos DB) and **Fabric databases** (such as Fabric SQL Database and Cosmos DB**)** now ensures that large values from source systems are read without the previous **8 KB truncation,** enabling scenarios like storing JSON docs, logs and long descriptive data. This is especially critical for **Cosmos DB**, as it prevents JSON corruption caused by truncation.\n\nThe **mapping** for the source Delta types to the SQL column types in SQL analytics endpoint tables is as follows:\n\n- Large columns (String or VARCHAR(N) where N ≥ 2000) → represented as VARCHAR(MAX).\n- Smaller columns (VARCHAR(N) where N &lt; 2000) → represented as VARCHAR(4\\*N).\n\nRefer to the [Autogenerated data types in the SQL analytics endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/data-types#autogenerated-data-types-in-the-sql-analytics-endpoint) documentation for mapping details.\n\nThe **maximum size** of string or binary values in SQL analytics endpoints depends on the mirrored item type:\n\n- Mirrored SQL server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed instance and SQL database in Fabric → up to 1 MB.\n- Mirrored Azure Cosmos DB and Cosmos DB in Fabric → up to 2 MB.\n\nRefer to the documentation for the [limits per mirrored item type](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/mirroring/troubleshooting#some-of-the-data-in-my-column-appears-to-be-truncated).\n\nFor newly created tables, columns are automatically mapped to VARCHAR(MAX) and VARBINARY(MAX) in the SQL analytics endpoints. For existing tables with columns storing large objects, you can recreate the table to adopt the new data type, or it will be automatically upgraded to VARCHAR(MAX) / VARBINARY(MAX) during the next schema change.\n\nRefer to the [Limitations of Fabric Data Warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/limitations) documentation to learn more.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith support for **VARCHAR(MAX)** and **VARBINARY(MAX)**, Fabric Data Warehouse and SQL analytics endpoints for mirrored items remove previous limitations on large text and binary data. This enhancement ensures accurate ingestion, storage, and querying of complex data types—such as JSON, logs, and spatial objects—without truncation or corruption.\n\nWhether you’re working with mirrored sources like **Azure SQL Database** and **Cosmos DB**, or creating new tables in **Fabric Data Warehouse**, you now have the flexibility to handle large objects efficiently and reliably.",
