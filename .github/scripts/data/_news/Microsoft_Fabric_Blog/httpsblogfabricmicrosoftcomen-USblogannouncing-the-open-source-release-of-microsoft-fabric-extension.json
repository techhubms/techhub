It centralizes common functionality required across all Fabric workloads.\n\n### Key responsibilities of the Core extension:\n\n- **Authentication & Tenant Management:** Sign in/out of Fabric and switch tenants.\n- **Workspace Management:** Open, create, and navigate Fabric workspaces.\n- **Item Operations:** Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Fabric items.\n- **Git Integration:** Clone Git-enabled workspaces and manage version control.\n- **Extension Points:** Exposes APIs and services that satellite extensions can consume to add workload-specific features.\n\n## Enhancing experience with satellite extensions\n\nSatellite extensions are optional, workload-specific add-ons that build on the capabilities of the core extension. They register with the core extension and implement additional functionality for specialized scenarios. Currently we have [User Data Functions Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/create-user-data-functions-vs-code) that adds tools for authoring, debugging, and deploying user-defined functions in Fabric. Stay tuned for more enhanced features for items in Fabric.\n\n## Contributing to the Fabric extension\n\nThere are many ways to contribute to the documentation. Review the following sections to find out which one is right for you.\n\n- **Report bugs and suggesting enhancements:** Submit issues or provide feedback using [GitHub Is](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-fabric/issues)[s](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-fabric/issues)[ues](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-fabric/issues).\n- **Pull requests:** You can submit a PR with feature enhancement. Provide detailed description and expected user experience in your PR. This will be reviewed by the team and triaged.\n\nNote that the project is open source and it can take some time to reply back to your PRs or issues.  Contributors must adhere to the [code of conduct.](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/.)\n\n## Get involved\n\nStay tuned for future announcements and updates as we continue to enhance the Fabric extension experience.
