This allows humans and computers alike to discover and understand the capabilities of a service in a standardized format. This is critical for creating integrations with external systems, AI agents and code generators.\n\nNow, you can automatically generate the Open API specification of your Fabric User Data Functions by using the **Generate invocation code** feature of the Functions portal. This feature, in combination with making your functions publicly accessible, can enable the following use cases:\n\n1. **Generate client code**: Your functions can be invoked using a REST API call from outside of Fabric. Certain tools such as [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) can use your OpenAPI specifications to automatically generate a client application to call the endpoints defined in your function.\n2. **Integrate with API gateways and management:** You can import your Open API specification into API management platforms, such as [Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/import-api-from-oas?tabs=portal), allowing you to use it for your public Fabric User Data Functions.\n3. **Integrate with AI agents**: You can use an AI platform such as [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) to [configure a tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/openapi-spec-samples?pivots=portal) that a model can use, unlocking many agentic use cases.\n\n## **How to generate an OpenAPI specification?**\n\n**IMPORTANT** **NOTE:** To use this feature, you need to have the most up-to-date version of the `fabric-user-data-functions` library. You can find more information on how to update this library.\n\nTo get generate your OpenAPI specification, simply navigate to your User Data Functions item in the Fabric portal and click on **Generate invocation code** on the toolbar of your functions. After that, you can select **Open API specification** from the drop-down menu. A new window will pop up where you can copy your specification. You can choose between JSON and YAML on the top bar.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blog_openapi_spec-1.gif)How to get your OpenAPI specification from the Functions portal.\n\nMake sure your Python functions contain a [DOCSTRING](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) to describe their functionality and add the use case context they need. This will be used as part of the documentation for your OpenAPI specification.\n\n## **How do I update my Fabric User Data Functions library?**\n\nTo update this library, go to the Functions portal of your User Data Functions item and use the following steps:\n\n1. Select **Library Management** from the Functions portal page.\n2. Locate the `fabric-user-data-functions`\nlibrary in the table, hover over it and select the edit icon.\n3. Select the latest version from the from the dropdown: it’s listed at the top. There’s no need to publish your functions after updating your library. It’s always a good idea to keep this library up to date.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blog-test-in-portal-4.png)*Use this dropdown to select a new version of your libraries.*\n\n## **Resources**\n\nFeel free to email [FabricUserDataFunctionsPreview@service.microsoft.com](mailto:FabricUserDataFunctionsPreview@service.microsoft.com) if you have any more questions.\n\nFor additional information about the new features and Fabric User Data Functions, refer to the following documentation.\n\n- Read the documentation of [Develop mode in the Microsoft Fabric docs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2330551).\n- Learn more about [Fabric User Data Functions in the Microsoft Fabric docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-overview).",
