  "EnhancedContent": "Basemaps provide essential context, but when you need up-to-date, analysis-ready imagery or specialized raster layers, Maps in Fabric now lets you bring your own data from OneLake directly into Real-Time Intelligence.\n\nRecently at FabCon Europe, we introduced Maps for geospatial insights in the Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence workload. Since then, we’ve added the ability to share Maps through Org Apps, and now at Ignite, we’re excited to announce additional capabilities\n\n- Support for imagery and other raster data from OneLake.\n- Custom labels for your own layers (points, lines, polygons).\n\n## Why it Matters\n\nGeospatial analytics brings another dimension to your data evaluation toolkit. This context is critical for understanding real-time operations, optimizing logistics plans, and making smarter decisions in the moment:\n\n- Where are my assets?\n- Where is risk increasing?\n- Where should crews go next?\n- How do I optimize work orders or deliveries across multiple crews?\n\nMaps in Fabric enables you to combine spatial context, real-time data, and now your own imagery for decisions in the moment and the planning ahead.\n\n## Examples\n\n**Vegetation Management:** With frequently updated imagery from the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) you can detect where vegetation is high enough to reach into power lines.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/map_vegetation_management-2-1024x546.png)\n\nBy extracting high-risk areas and intersecting them with your powerline corridors, you can pinpoint exactly where crews should be sent to inspect and prune. Tracking crews along the way is easy, and with Org Apps, the entire workflow can be shared across the organization.\n\n**Construction Monitoring:** Pull weekly site imagery, label milestones, and compare changes over time to catch delays early—before they impact the project’s bottom line.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/construction-1024x544.png)\n\n**ESG-Dashboards:** Bring in land cover or canopy raster imagery, overlay it with your asset portfolio, and label sites with green space scores combined with energy-use data in Fabric for sustainability insights.\n\nThe possibilities are limitless. Integrate custom imagery, spatial layers, and real-time data for advanced geospatial analysis.\n\nRefer to the [Create a map (preview)](https://aka.ms/StartWithFabricMaps) documentation to get started, experiment with your own datasets and workflows to unlock new insights and operational efficiencies and [share your feedback](https://aka.ms/realtimeforum) and [ideas](https://aka.ms/fabric-ideas) to help us shape future enhancements.\n\nGet started today and discover how spatial intelligence can transform your decision-making processes.",
