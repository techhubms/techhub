  "EnhancedContent": "In today’s data-driven world, resilience and recoverability are no longer optional—they’re foundational. Microsoft Fabric continues to evolve as a unified data platform, and one of its most impactful enhancements is the ability to extend point-in-time restore (PITR) retention for Fabric SQL databases from the default 7 days to up to 35 days.\n\nThis feature empowers organizations to meet stricter compliance requirements, improve operational recovery flexibility, and reduce risk from accidental data loss or malicious activity.\n\n## Fabric SQL DB: A Quick Primer\n\nFabric SQL DB is a fully managed, SaaS-style relational database offering within Microsoft Fabric. Bringing the power of SQL to the Fabric ecosystem, enabling seamless integration with analytical workloads, Power BI, and OneLake. Designed for simplicity and scale, Fabric SQL DB abstracts infrastructure management while offering enterprise-grade capabilities like high availability, telemetry, and security.\n\n### Automated Backups: Built-In Protection\n\nFrom the moment a Fabric SQL database is created, automated backups are enabled by default.\n\n- Full backups every week.\n- Differential backups every 12 hours.\n- Transaction log backups approximately every 10 minutes.\n\nThese backups are stored in zone-redundant storage (ZRS), ensuring durability and availability across multiple Azure availability zones.\n\n### Point-in-Time Restore (PITR): Precision Recovery\n\nPITR allows users to restore a database to any specific moment within the configured retention window. Whether recovering from a user error, application bug, or security incident, PITR provides granular control to rewind your database to a known good state.\n\nUntil recently, PITR in Fabric SQL DB supported a 7-day retention window. With the latest update, this can now be extended to 35 days, offering significantly more flexibility for operational recovery and compliance scenarios.\n\n### Why Extend Retention?\n\nThe following are key use cases where extended retention makes a difference:\n\n- Regulatory Compliance: Industries like finance and healthcare often require longer data retention for audit and recovery purposes.\n- Operational Safety Net: More time to detect and recover from silent data corruption or delayed errors.\n- Backup Strategy Alignment: Align PITR with broader backup and disaster recovery policies across your data estate.\n\n### How to Configure Extended Retention\n\nYou can configure PITR retention via the Fabric portal. The retention policy is applied at the database level and affects how long backups are retained for PITR operations. Once configured, users can restore a database to any point within the extended window using the familiar restore experience in Fabric.\n\n1. Login to your Fabric workspace\n2. Navigate to your Fabric SQL database\n3. Select ‘Settings’\n4. Select ‘Backup retention policy’\n5. A slider that allows extending the retention up to 35 days will be visible. Choose the desired retention setting via the slider or enter the value from 1-35 directly into the text box.\n6. Select ‘Save’.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-28-1024x497.png)\n\n### Billing impact\n\nExtending retention for Fabric SQL database incurs storage charges for the configured retention.\n\n### Backup Observability\n\nAs previously mentioned, as soon as the Fabric SQL database is created, backups are automatically scheduled. You can view the backup history by using the [sys.dm_database_backups](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-database-backups-azure-sql-database?view=azuresqldb-current) DMV.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-1024x286.gif)\n\nThe backup\\_type column indicates whether its Full (D) or Differential (I) or Transaction log (L) backup.\n\n### Summary\n\nExtending PITR retention from 7 to 35 days is a small configuration change with big implications. It gives teams more time, more confidence, and more control over their data recovery strategy. Whether you’re building analytics solutions, SaaS applications, or internal tools, Fabric SQL DB now offers deeper protection for your data.\n\nIf you’re already using Fabric SQL DB, consider updating your retention policy today [NS1] [DN2]. And if you’re new to Fabric, this is one more reason to explore what the platform has to offer.",
