Whether it’s a Lakehouse for analysis in Fabric Notebooks or a workspace for managing permissions.\n- **Sign in with different accounts**: and use the flexibility to choose which account to use when signing in.\n- **Access diagnostic logs** to troubleshoot sync issues or understand system behavior.\n\nThese features make OneLake file explorer a seamless extension of your data workflows.\n\n## **What’s New?**\n\n- **Smarter Sync for Temporary Files:** Temporary files (.tmp)—often created during edits in applications like Microsoft Excel—will no longer get stuck in the syn**c** pending state. This issue typically occurred when there were network connectivity problems, preventing .tmp files from uploading and causing conflicts with the server. These files are now cleaned up automatically once the network connection is restored, eliminating persistent sync indicators on temporary files that should have been removed during the save process.\n- **Stability Improvements:** We’ve resolved a memory access violation that previously caused crashes when syncing files that hadn’t been opened before. This fix improves reliability and prevents unexpected shutdowns during background sync operations.\n- **.NET 8 Migration:** has been migrated to .NET 8, ensuring the app stays current with Microsoft’s supported frameworks. This upgrade enhances security and ensures continued eligibility for long-term support.\n\nIf you haven’t used OneLake file explorer in a while, now’s a great time to jump back in. With improved performance, smarter sync behavior, and a more stable experience, OneLake file explorer is ready to support your data workflows more seamlessly than ever.\n\n[Get the latest version for OneLake file explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=105222)",
