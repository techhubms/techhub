  "EnhancedContent": "Microsoft Fabric continues to evolve as a unified platform for data professionals, and the latest update to Semantic Link introduces [Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser) support—a key enhancement for teams looking to automate and scale their data workflows securely.\n\n[Semantic Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-overview) enables seamless integration between notebooks and semantic models, allowing users to query and analyze data directly from their models. With the introduction of Service Principal authentication, organizations can now run notebooks and pipelines without relying on user credentials, unlocking new levels of reliability and security.\n\n## Automating Workflows with Confidence\n\nService Principals are Azure identities designed for applications and automation tools. By supporting these identities, Semantic Link now allows notebooks to be triggered by Fabric Pipelines or the Job Scheduler API using non-interactive authentication. Meaning scheduled jobs can run consistently, even when no user is signed in—ideal for production-grade deployments and enterprise-scale operations.\n\nFor more advanced scenarios, teams can also manually configure Service Principal credentials to access the full feature set of Semantic Link. This flexibility ensures that both automated and interactive workflows are supported, while maintaining strict access controls.\n\nYou can set service principal authentication with Key Vault values:\n\n``` import sempy.fabric as fabric from sempy.fabric import set_service_principal\n\ndataset = \"<replace-with-your-dataset-name>\" workspace = \"<replace-with-your-workspace-id>\"\n\ntenant_kv = (\"<replace-with-your-tenant-vault-url>\", \"<replace-with-your-tenant-secret-name>\") client_kv = (\"<replace-with-your-client-vault-url>\", \"<replace-with-your-client-secret-name>\") client_cert_kv = (\"<replace-with-your-client-certification-vault-url>\", \"<replace-with-your-client-certification-secret-name>\")\n\nwith set_service_principal(tenant_kv, client_kv, client_certificate=client_cert_kv): fabric.run_model_bpa(dataset, workspace=workspace) ```\n\n## Benefits of Service Principal support for Semantic Link\n\nService Principal support in Semantic Link is a game-changer for organizations operating at scale. This enhancement is especially valuable for enterprises that:\n\n- Schedule or trigger notebooks using Semantic Link as an integral part of their broader data pipelines.\n\n- Demand secure, credential-free connections to semantic models to uphold stringent security policies.\n\n- Face the challenge of scaling automation and data processes across multiple teams and complex environments.\n\nService Principal support streamlines authentication for Semantic Link, reducing manual credential management and enabling secure, automated workflows across teams and environments.\n\n## Learn More\n\nTo get started with Service Principal authentication in Semantic Link, including version requirements and setup instructions, refer to the official documentation: [Semantic Link Service Principal Support](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-service-principal-support).",
