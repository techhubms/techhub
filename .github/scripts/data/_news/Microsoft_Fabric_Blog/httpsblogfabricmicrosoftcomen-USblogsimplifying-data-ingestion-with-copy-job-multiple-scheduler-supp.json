  "EnhancedContent": "Copy Job is the go-to solution in Microsoft Fabric Data Factory for simplified data movement. With native support for multiple delivery styles, including bulk copy, incremental copy, and change data capture (CDC) replication, Copy job offers the flexibility to handle a wide range of scenarios—all through an intuitive, easy-to-use experience.\n\nIn this update, we’re excited to announce a powerful new enhancement: **multiple scheduler** support. This gives you even greater control over *when* your data moves.\n\nNow, a single Copy job can be triggered at different intervals—for example, one scheduler runs daily at 6 AM, while another runs weekly on Sundays. In the past, achieving this required creating multiple Copy jobs with each schedule. With this update, you can configure all your schedules directly within the same Copy job, making orchestration simpler, cleaner, and more efficient.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-24-1024x941.png)\n\nAs you expected, the multiple schedulers can be deployed alongside the Copy job via Git, Deployment Pipelines, or public APIs.
