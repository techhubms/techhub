This page helps you understand how individual items and operations contribute to overall capacity usage.\n\n## **Key Features**\n\n- **Slicers**: Filter by ‘capacity name’, ‘workspace’, ‘experience’, ‘operation’, ‘run by’ and ‘billing type’.\n- **Aggregate Compute Consumption**\n- **CU(s) by workspace**: Filter which workspaces are consuming the most capacity units.\n- **CU(s) by item**: Filter which items are consuming the most capacity units.\n- **Smoothed CU% over time:** Filter background vs. interactive operations and identify overloads with the CU % limit line.\n- **Workspace details:** Indicates aggregated workspace-level usage metrics such as operations pass rate, number of operations and % compute consumed.\n- **Item History**\n- **Scheduling Frequency:** Indicates the number of operations by date.\n- **% breakdown by status**: Indicates the percentage distribution of operations based on their completion status.\n- **CU(s) by date**: Displays CUs by date.\n- **Item details**: Find detailed item-level usage data such as date scheduled, % compute consumed, status and number of seconds of throttling applied.\n\nThese visuals empower users to pinpoint bottlenecks, optimize workloads, and plan capacity upgrades with confidence.\n\n**Example:** How the Item History Page appears.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1.png)\n\n## **Use Cases**\n\n- **Capacity Planning**: Identify items that consistently consume high CU and forecast future needs.\n- **Usage Trends:** Identify usage trends for items and workspaces to understand their impact on CU usage over time.\n\nThe release of the Item History page is another step in our journey towards transparent, real-time, and actionable capacity monitoring. We’d like to encourage everyone to explore the new page and share feedback to help shape its evolution.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Understand the metrics app item history page (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app-item-history-page)documentation.\n\n## **Get Started**\n\nThe Item History page is available in the Fabric Capacity Metrics App. Install or upgrade to the latest version of the [Fabric Capacity Metrics App](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/power-bi/pbi_pcmm.microsoftpremiumfabricpreviewreport) and begin exploring your capacity data today.",
