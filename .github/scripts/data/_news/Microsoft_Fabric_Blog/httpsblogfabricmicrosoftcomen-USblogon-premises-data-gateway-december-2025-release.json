  "EnhancedContent": "The December 2025 release of the on-premises data gateway is (version 3000.298).\n\n## New Feature\n\n### Manual Update for On-premises Data Gateway (Preview)\n\nThis new capability simplifies gateway maintenance and helps ensure your environment remains secure and up to date. With this preview, you can now initiate gateway updates manually—either directly from the gateway UI or programmatically through API or script—giving you full control over when and how updates are applied.\n\nThe November release serves as the **baseline version** for this feature, and customers can start performing **manual updates beginning in December**. This enhancement also paves the way for future support of fully automatic updates.\n\n![](https://dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-30705-61.png)\n\nTo learn more, refer to the [Update an on-premises data gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-update?toc=%2Ffabric%2Fdata-factory%2Ftoc.json&amp;bc=fabric%2Fdata-factory%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json) documentation.\n\n## Power BI Desktop Compatibility\n\nThis update brings the on-premises data gateway up to date with the December 2025 release of Power BI Desktop.\n\n[Download on-premises data gateway (standard mode)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/d/a/1/da1fddb8-6da8-4f50-b4d0-18019591e182/GatewayInstall-25-12.exe)\n\n[Download on-premises data gateway (personal mode)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/0/2/602A459E-E1A3-4FB9-B07F-FC2B60881900/On-premises%20data%20gateway%20%28personal%20mode%29-25-12.exe)\n\nThis version of the gateway will ensure that the reports that you publish to the Power BI Service and refresh via the gateway will go through the same query execution logic/run-time as in the December’s version of Power BI Desktop.
