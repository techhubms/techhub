[Customer-managed keys (CMK)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/workspace-customer-managed-keys), which you create, own, and maintain in your Azure Key Vault (AKV), offer enhanced control over your encryption strategy. With CMK, you oversee the lifecycle, access, and use of your keys, providing an added layer of security beyond what Microsoft-managed encryption offers. This is especially beneficial for organizations that have strict compliance, governance, or advanced security requirements. You can rotate keys and revoke key access at any time to protect sensitive information within your organization.\n\n## What’s new?\n\n[Customer managed keys w](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/encrypt-data-at-rest-in-your-fabric-workspaces-using-customer-managed-keys/)[ere](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/encrypt-data-at-rest-in-your-fabric-workspaces-using-customer-managed-keys/)[launched in preview](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/encrypt-data-at-rest-in-your-fabric-workspaces-using-customer-managed-keys/), offering workspace administrators the ability to use keys in Azure Key Vault and Managed HSM, to protect data in certain Fabric items. Now, we are extending the encryption support to more Fabric workloads. You can now create Fabric Warehouses, Notebooks and utilize the SQL Analytics Endpoint in workspaces enabled with encryption using your keys.\n\n![](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-25.png)\n\nWe are actively working on bringing you additional functionality including API support, ability to use Key Vaults behind a firewall and support for even more Fabric items. To learn more, refer to the [customer-managed keys documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/workspace-customer-managed-keys) and [Warehouse’s CMK launch blog](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/bringing-customer-managed-keys-to-fabric-warehouse-and-sql-analytics-endpoint/).\n\n## Getting started with CMK for your Fabric workspace\n\nWorkspace admins can use the Fabric portal to navigate to workspace settings and set up encryption using customer managed keys. Refer to the [encryption documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/security/workspace-customer-managed-keys) for a step-by-step guide.\n\nYour feedback is essential!
