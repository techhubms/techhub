  "EnhancedContent": "At Ignite, we [announced operations agents](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/improving-operational-efficiency-with-operations-agents-in-real-time-intelligence/) that helps create autonomous agents that monitor data, infer goals, and recommend actions. Soon, we will enable billing for these agents as the Preview period continues.\n\nOperations agents will use Fabric Capacity Units (CU) like any other Fabric features. In the [Capacity Metrics App](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app-compute-page), you’ll find the following operations show four operations agents:\n\n- **Copilot in Fabric** usage is accrued when you use the LLM to configure or interact with the agent directly.\n- **Operations agent compute** is the cost incurred by the agent querying and monitoring the data in the background. This charge is based on the compute required by the agent to evaluate its rules and conditions—there may be additional costs incurred by any data source to serve the required data.\n- **Operations agent autonomous reasoning** is the LLM usage when a condition is met, and the agent summarizes and reasons over the data to produce its recommendations and messages back to the user for approval.\n- **Storage** is the cost of retaining Fabric items and events. Data the agent monitors is retained for 30 days and are stored within Fabric, incurring corresponding Fabric storage costs.\n\nAt each stage of the flow for creating and running an operations agent, the following usage is incurred:\n\n![Diagram of the stages of operations agent and the meters used at each stage. The text following the image describes it.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-6-1024x449.png)Operations agent flow and meters\n\nWhen you configure the operations agent, Copilot In Fabric usage is incurred while the agent generates its playbook. You will also see usage on the Eventhouse as queries are run to identify the appropriate fields to monitor and queries to run. Storage costs are incurred to save the configuration of the agent.\n\nWhen starting the agent, it runs queries and tracks rules in the background. This uses the Operations agent compute meter, and will periodically run queries against your Eventhouse, incurring charges there. Again, storage costs are incurred for the agent configuration, and the cached results of the queries.\n\nFinally, when the monitored conditions are met in the data, the agent uses its LLM to summarize and make recommendations. This uses the Operations agent autonomous reasoning meter. If the user approves the recommended action, it’ll invoke the Power Automate flow. Typically, Power Automate is licensed per month rather than per run, but please consult [Power Automate pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-automate/pricing) for your situation.\n\n## Usage Categories\n\nAll of the operations agent’s Fabric usage is considered *Background usage*, even if you are directly interacting with the agent. This is because all Fabric Copilot and AI operations are considered background usage—you can read more about it in the [Copilot Fabric Consumption](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/fundamentals/copilot-fabric-consumption#capacity-utilization-type) article.\n\nUse the [Capacity Metrics App](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app-compute-page) to observe types of operations, their duration, and the percentage of the capacity consumed.\n\n![Screenshot of the capacity metrics app listing the capacity operations for the operations agent.](//dataplatformblogwebfd-d3h9cbawf0h8ecgf.b01.azurefd.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-7.png)Capacity metrics app operations\n\n## Operation Rates\n\n| **Azure metric name** | **Fabric operation name** | **CU rate** | | --- | --- | --- | | Operations Agents Compute Capacity Usage CU | Operations agent compute | 0.46 CUs per vCore hour | | Copilot and AI Capacity Usage CU | Copilot in Fabric | 100 CUs per 1000 input tokens<br>400 CUs per 1000 output tokens | | Operations Agents Autonomous Reasoning Capacity Usage CU | Operations agent autonomous reasoning | 400 CUs per 1000 input tokens 1600 CUs per 1000 output tokens | | n/a | OneLake Storage | per GB per hour (as per [OneLake consumption)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/onelake-consumption) |\n\nOperations agent metrics and rates\n\nYou’ll find usage reported in the capacity metrics app in December. Billing for the Copilot in Fabric will begin in December, and billing for the remaining operations will start no earlier than January 8, 2026.\n\nTo learn more, refer to the documentation on [Operations agent billing](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/real-time-intelligence/operations-agent-billing).",
