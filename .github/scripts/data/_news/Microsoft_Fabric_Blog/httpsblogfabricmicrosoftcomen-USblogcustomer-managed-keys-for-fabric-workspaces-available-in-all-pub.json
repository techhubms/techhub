This expansion makes it easier for customers worldwide to meet compliance requirements and implement robust data protection strategies.\n\nNote: This feature was released in [public preview](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/encrypt-data-at-rest-in-your-fabric-workspaces-using-customer-managed-keys/) in a limited set of regions earlier this year and here’s the [step-by-step guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/workspace-customer-managed-keys) for setup.\n\nFabric already encrypts all data at rest with Microsoft-managed keys (MMK). CMK gives you an option to meet compliance and regulatory requirements beyond that, by using keys you own to protect your data.\n\nWith this release we are also adding support for [Azure Managed HSM (MHSM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview). MHSM support brings added benefits such as higher security standards and dedicated hardware protection, giving way for customers with stricter compliance requirements to take advantage.\n\nWe encourage you to try out CMK in your Fabric workspaces and take advantage of these new capabilities. Your feedback is invaluable as we continue to improve and expand our security offerings—please share your [experiences and suggestions](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-Ideas/idb-p/fbc_ideas) with us!",
