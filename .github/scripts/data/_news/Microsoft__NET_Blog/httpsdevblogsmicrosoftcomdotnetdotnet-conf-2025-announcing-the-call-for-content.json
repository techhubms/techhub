Mark your calendars: November 11-13, 2025, will be three days of pure .NET goodness as we launch .NET 10 and dive into all the cool stuff happening in our ecosystem. Head over to [dotnetconf.net](https://dotnetconf.net) to add it to your calendar so you don‚Äôt miss it!\n\n## Why .NET Conf Rocks\n\n.NET Conf is our free, three-day virtual celebration that brings together .NET developers from around the world. It‚Äôs a community effort ‚Äì we partner with Microsoft, the .NET Foundation, and awesome sponsors to make it happen. But honestly? The best part is YOU ‚Äì the incredible .NET community.\n\nThis is where we get together to share what we‚Äôre building, learn from each other, and get genuinely excited about the future of .NET development.\n\nThis year we‚Äôre launching .NET 10, diving deep into .NET Aspire‚Äôs latest features, and exploring how AI is changing the game for .NET developers.\n\n## We Want to Hear from YOU\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì .NET Conf has always been about our amazing community. We‚Äôre looking for passionate developers who want to share their stories, show off their cool projects, and teach others what they‚Äôve learned along the way.\n\nWhether you‚Äôve been speaking at conferences for years or you‚Äôve never presented before but have something awesome to share ‚Äì we want to hear from you! Seriously, some of our best sessions have come from first-time speakers who just had something cool they wanted to show the world.\n\n### What Kind of Sessions Are We Looking For?\n\nWe want **30-minute sessions** (including Q&A time) that show off what‚Äôs possible with .NET. Here‚Äôs what gets us excited:\n\n- **Web stuff**: Cool ASP.NET Core projects, Blazor adventures, or that awesome web architecture you built\n- **Mobile & Desktop**: .NET MAUI apps, cross-platform tricks, or how you modernized that old desktop app\n- **AI & Machine Learning**: ML.NET projects, AI integrations, or how you‚Äôre using AI in your .NET apps\n- **IoT & Edge**: .NET running on tiny devices, IoT solutions, or embedded projects\n- **Games**: Building games with .NET, Unity integrations, or game development tips\n- **Cloud & Containers**: Your containerization journey, microservices patterns, or cloud-native adventures\n- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines that actually work, deployment strategies, or how you made your team more productive\n- **Open Source**: That library you built, your contribution story, or community projects you love\n\nWe‚Äôd love to see what you‚Äôre doing with .NET 9 or 10, but honestly, if you‚Äôve got something cool and .NET-related that‚Äôll make developers go ‚Äúwow, I want to try that!‚Äù ‚Äì we want to hear about it!\n\n### What Makes a Session Stand Out?\n\n**Insider Tip**\n\nThe Microsoft .NET team will be showing off the shiny new features and big announcements. To give your session the best shot, focus on real-world content‚Äîyour experiences, your projects, and your ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments.\n\nThink about sessions like:\n\n- **Your war stories**: What you learned building that challenging project\n- **Architecture deep-dives**: How you solved complex problems in your apps\n- **Open source adventures**: That library you created or contributed to\n- **Best practices you discovered**: Patterns and techniques that actually work\n- **Side projects**: That fun thing you built that shows off .NET in a cool way\n- **Productivity hacks**: Tools and techniques that make you a more effective developer\n\nThe community wants to hear about what **you‚Äôre** building with .NET, not rehash what they can already read in the release notes. Show us your creativity!\n\n## The Important Stuff\n\n**Don't Procrastinate!**\n\nThe Call for Content closes on **August 31, 2025, at 11:59 PM PDT**. Trust us, you don‚Äôt want to be scrambling at the last minute!\n\n### Here‚Äôs What You Need to Know\n\n- **When**: November 11-13, 2025\n- **Where**: Online (present from wherever you are!)\n- **How long**: 30 minutes including Q&A\n- **Time zones**: Present in your own time zone ‚Äì we‚Äôll figure out the schedule magic\n- **Sessions per speaker**: We‚Äôre limiting it to 1 session per person so more folks can participate\n\n### Ready to Submit? Here‚Äôs How\n\n1. **Head over to**: [sessionize.com/net-conf-2025](https://sessionize.com/net-conf-2025)\n2. **Write an awesome proposal**: Give us a catchy title and tell us why your session will be amazing\n3. **Tell us about you**: Share your background and any speaking experience (but don‚Äôt stress if you‚Äôre new!)\n4. **Show your creds**: Got videos of past talks? Links to your projects? Throw them in there!\n\n**Insider Tip**\n\nInclude videos of past talks or demos of your projects in your proposal. It helps us see your presentation style and gets us excited about your session!\n\n## Come Celebrate with the .NET Family\n\nLook, .NET Conf isn‚Äôt just another conference ‚Äì it‚Äôs our yearly family reunion! It‚Äôs where developers from every corner of the planet come together to geek out about code, share those ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that worked!‚Äù moments, and push each other to build even cooler stuff.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre the person building the next big web app, creating mobile experiences that users love, or figuring out how to make AI work in your business apps ‚Äì your story matters. The .NET community wants to celebrate your wins, learn from your mistakes, and cheer you on as you tackle your next challenge.\n\n## Your Turn to Shine\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì the .NET ecosystem is amazing because of people like you. That unique way you solved a problem, that library you built in your spare time, that ‚Äúwhat if I tried this?‚Äù experiment that actually worked ‚Äì that stuff is pure gold to other developers.\n\nDon‚Äôt let that voice in your head tell you ‚Äúsomeone else probably knows this better.‚Äù Nope! Your perspective, your journey, your hard-won insights could be exactly what another developer needs to hear right now.\n\n[Submit Your Session Now!](https://sessionize.com/net-conf-2025)\n\n## Let‚Äôs Make This the Best .NET Conf Yet\n\n.NET Conf 2025 is going to be incredible, but it won‚Äôt be complete without voices from our amazing community. We‚Äôve got the submission portal open through August 31st, and we‚Äôre genuinely excited to see what awesome sessions you‚Äôll propose.\n\nHere‚Äôs what we know: .NET Conf is where magic happens. It‚Äôs where a casual conversation in the chat leads to your next big project idea. It‚Äôs where that demo you‚Äôre nervous about becomes the solution someone‚Äôs been searching for. It‚Äôs where you realize you‚Äôre part of something way bigger than just writing code.\n\nYour session could be the one that sparks the next breakthrough, solves a problem thousands of developers are facing, or just makes someone‚Äôs day a little brighter with a cool demo.\n\nDon‚Äôt wait ‚Äì submit your session today and let‚Äôs make .NET Conf 2025 absolutely unforgettable!
