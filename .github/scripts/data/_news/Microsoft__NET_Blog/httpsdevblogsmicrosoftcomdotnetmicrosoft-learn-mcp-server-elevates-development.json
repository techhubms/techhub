  "EnhancedContent": "Have you tried asking GitHub Copilot about Aspire 13 or the new Agent Framework and found it either hallucinated an answer or told you that those things didn’t exist? This happens because the model used was trained before those things did exist, so it doesn’t know how to answer or help you. As you continue to innovate and move at the speed of AI, you need a development assistant that can keep up with the latest information.\n\nIntroducing the MS Learn Model Context Protocol (MCP) server tools. In this post, we’ll explore how the Learn MCP server enhances the developer experience with Copilot, showcase practical examples, and provide straightforward integration instructions for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, the Copilot Command Line Interface, and the Copilot Coding Agent.\n\n## What Is the MS Learn MCP Server?\n\nThe MS Learn MCP server is a managed content provider designed to seamlessly provide Copilot with high-quality, up-to-date, context-aware Microsoft product documentation, code samples, and learning resources to ensure it has the latest information to provide the developer with the best results. Whether you’re building a new AI agent or optimizing an existing WinForms application, the Learn MCP server ensures Copilot has the information it needs.\n\n## Enhancing the Developer Experience\n\nBy integrating the Learn MCP server with Copilot, .NET developers benefit from a more intelligent and responsive coding environment. Here’s how it makes a difference:\n\n- Improved Code Suggestions: Copilot delivers code suggestions and explanations backed by trusted Microsoft Learn content, reducing the risk of outdated or incorrect guidance.\n- Context Awareness: The MCP server returns documentation and code samples specific to your scenario—whether you’re working with .NET 10, experimenting with Aspire, or building APIs in C#.\n- Faster Problem Solving: Instead of leaving your editor to search for documentation, you get instant, in-place answers and code references, accelerating your workflow.\n- Learning While Coding: Accessing MS Learn modules and tutorials helps you upskill in real time as you work on projects.\n\n## Key Use Cases: MCP Server in Action with Copilot\n\n- On-Demand API References: While implementing authentication in ASP.NET Core, Copilot—powered by the Learn MCP server—provides inline references to the latest Microsoft Identity documentation and code samples specific to your framework version.\n![Screenshot of Copilot Chat using MS Learn MCP Server to get API references](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/12/MSLearn-APIReference.webp)\n- Best Practice Recommendations: As you write a new MCP Server, Copilot surfaces best practices from MS Learn, ensuring your implementation follows current guidelines.\n\n![Screenshot of Copilot Chat using MS Learn MCP Server to get best practice information](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/12/MSLearn-BestPracticeRecommendation.webp)\n- Learning New Frameworks or Libraries: When experimenting with technologies like gRPC or SignalR, Copilot can recommend relevant MS Learn modules and code samples, accelerating onboarding and knowledge acquisition.\n![Screenshot of Copilot Chat using MS Learn MCP Server to get information about a framework or library](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/12/MSLearn-Learning.webp)\n\n## Integration Instructions\n\nReady to harness the power of the Learn MCP server with Copilot? Below are step-by-step guides for integrating the MCP server into your favorite tools.\n\n### Visual Studio\n\n1. Make sure you are on Visual Studio 2026 or Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14.\n2.
