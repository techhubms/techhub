  "EnhancedContent": "We‚Äôre excited to announce Trusted Publishing on nuget.org ‚Äî a simpler, safer way to publish NuGet packages from GitHub Actions. Rather than relying on long‚Äëlived API keys, your workflow can use a short‚Äëlived GitHub OIDC token to request a temporary, single‚Äëuse NuGet API key. These keys expire quickly (‚âà 1 hour), eliminating long‚Äëlived secrets that need to be stored, rotated, or protected from leaks.\n\nüëâ Read the docs at [aka.ms/nuget/trusted-publishing](https://aka.ms/nuget/trusted-publishing)\n\n[![Trusted Publishing screenshot from NuGet.org](data:image/png;base64,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)](https://www.nuget.org/account/trustedpublishing)\n\n## Why Trusted Publishing? üîí\n\n- No long‚Äëlived secrets ‚Äî nothing sensitive stored in your repository or CI.\n- Short‚Äëlived credentials ‚Äî temporary API keys are issued just‚Äëin‚Äëtime and typically last about **1 hour**.\n- One token ‚Üí one key ‚Äî each job‚Äôs OIDC token maps to a single temporary API key used for that publish.\n\n## Getting started üöÄ\n\n1. **Open the Trusted Publishing page**\nSign in to **nuget.org** ‚Üí open your user menu (top right) ‚Üí **Trusted Publishing** (next to **API Keys**).\n2. **Create a policy**\n- **Package owner:** you or your organization\n- **Repository owner / repository:** your GitHub org/user and repository name (for example `contoso-sdk`\n)\n- **Workflow file:** the YAML file in `.github/workflows/`\n(for example `release.yml` )\n- *(Optional)* **Environment:** if your workflow uses GitHub Actions environments\n3. **Wire up your GitHub Actions workflow** using the minimal example below.\n\n## Minimal GitHub Actions example ‚öôÔ∏è\n\nThis example includes only the steps that interact with nuget.org: enabling OIDC, exchanging the token for a temporary API key, and pushing the package.\n\n```yaml permissions: id-token: write # required for GitHub OIDC\n\njobs: build-and-publish: permissions: id-token: write # enable GitHub OIDC token issuance for this job\n\nsteps:\n# Build your artifacts/my-sdk.nupkg package here\n\n# Get a short-lived NuGet API key\n- name: NuGet login (OIDC ‚Üí temp API key)\nuses: NuGet/login@v1 id: login with:\n# Recommended: use a secret like ${{ secrets.NUGET_USER }} for your nuget.org username (profile name), NOT your email address\nuser: contoso-bot\n\n# Push the package\nrun: dotnet nuget push artifacts/my-sdk.nupkg --api-key ${{ steps.login.outputs.NUGET_API_KEY }} --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json ```\n\n## How it works üîÅ\n\n1. GitHub issues an OIDC token to the job.\n2. The NuGet login step sends that token to nuget.org.\n3. nuget.org validates the token against your Trusted Publishing policy and returns a temporary API key.\n4. Your workflow uses that key to publish. Request the key immediately before running `dotnet nuget push`\n‚Äî it expires quickly (‚âà **1 hour**).\n\n## Policy ownership & lifecycle üìú\n\n- **Private repo bootstrap (7 days, re-activate anytime).** New policies for private repositories start out as active for 7 days by default. After the first successful NuGet login (the exchange of a job‚Äôs OIDC token for a temporary API key), the policy becomes permanently active and is bound to immutable GitHub IDs. If you miss the initial 7‚Äëday window, you can manually re‚Äëactivate the policy for another 7 days from the Trusted Publishing page. A successful NuGet login is sufficient ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to publish a package.\n- **Owner matters.** A policy is owned by a user or organization and applies only to packages owned by that owner.\n- **Org changes are respected.** If the policy creator loses org membership, or the org is locked or deleted, the policy is disabled and displays a clear warning. When membership or org access is restored, the policy re‚Äëactivates automatically.\n\n## Migrating from long‚Äëlived API keys üîÑ\n\nAlready publishing from GitHub Actions? Switching is easy:\n\n1. Create a Trusted Publishing policy on nuget.org.\n2. Remove stored NuGet API keys from your repo or CI secrets.\n3. Add `NuGet/login@v1`\nto your workflow and use its output key with `dotnet nuget push` .\n4. Done ‚Äî enjoy, no more key management!\n\n## Try it today üöÄ\n\n- Read the docs at [aka.ms/nuget/trusted-publishing](https://aka.ms/nuget/trusted-publishing)\n- Sign in to **nuget.org ‚Üí Trusted Publishing** (next to **API Keys**) and create your first policy.\n\nHuge thanks to [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/) and the [Securing Software Repos working group](https://openssf.org/technical-initiatives/repository-security/) for defining the Trusted Publishing guidelines and encouraging their adoption throughout the broader ecosystem.\n\nPublish more securely and with less friction ‚Äî thank you for contributing to the NuGet community. ‚ú®",
