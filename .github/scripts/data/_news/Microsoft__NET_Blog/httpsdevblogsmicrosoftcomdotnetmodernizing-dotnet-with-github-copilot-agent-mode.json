  "EnhancedContent": "Upgrading an old .NET app doesn’t have to mean chasing broken builds and cryptic errors. Yet for many developers, a simple version bump turns into hours of dependency conflicts and manual fixes.\n\nModernization isn’t just about staying current. Older frameworks can introduce security risks, slow performance, and block cloud adoption. Upgrading unlocks modern APIs, better tooling, and cloud-native features like automated scaling and secure identity management.\n\nThat’s where GitHub Copilot app modernization comes in. Think of it as your modernization assistant, guiding you through every step, automating the heavy lifting, and helping you move from “this might take weeks” to “done in hours.”\n\n## What you’ll learn\n\nBy the end of this guide, you’ll know how to:\n\n- Analyze your .NET projects and generate a clear upgrade plan\n- Apply changes automatically with GitHub Copilot\n- Fix build issues and validate tests in real time\n- Review a detailed summary report\n- Prepare your app for Azure migration and deployment\n\n## Before you begin\n\nTo follow along, make sure you have:\n\n- Visual Studio 2026 (or Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14.17 or newer)\n- A GitHub Copilot license (Pro, Pro +, Business or Enterprise)\n- .NET desktop development workload with the following optional components enabled: GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot app modernization\n\n## Upgrade your .NET app\n\n### Step 1: Open your project or solution\n\nStart by launching Visual Studio and opening your .NET project or solution.\n\n### Step 2: Start an agent session\n\nYou can begin in two ways:\n\n- Right-click your project or solution in Solution Explorer and select Modernize\n- Or open GitHub Copilot Chat and type @modernize followed by your request\n\n![Modernize right-click context menu action](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/modernize-menu-action.webp)\n\n### Step 3: Choose your path\n\nNext, decide what you want to do:\n\n- Upgrade to a newer .NET version for better performance and security\n- Migrate to Azure to unlock cloud-native capabilities\n- Explore more modernization options if you have additional goals\n\n![Upgrade to a newer version of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/upgrade-to-newer-version-dotnet.webp)\n\n### Step 4: Assess and plan\n\nCopilot assesses your code and dependencies, then:\n\n- Asks a few questions about your goals to tailor the plan\n- Generates a Markdown upgrade plan for transparency\n- Lets you review and edit the plan before moving forward\n\n![Upgrade plan.md](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/upgrade-plan.webp)\n\nYou can edit the plan to add context, reorder steps, or exclude certain projects before approving.\n\n### Step 5: Apply changes and resolve errors\n\nOnce you approve the plan, Copilot will:\n\n- Upgrade files, adjust imports, and fix syntax issues automatically\n- Handle build errors in a fix-and-test loop to ensure stability\n- Track progress in the Upgrade Progress Details document for visibility\n- Commit each major step to Git for easy rollback if needed\n\n![Upgrade Progress Details document](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/progress-ui.webp)\n\nIf Copilot encounters a problem it can’t fix automatically, it pauses and asks for your input, keeping you in control.\n\n### Step 6: Review the results\n\nAfter completion, Copilot provides:\n\n- A detailed report with Git commit hashes for traceability\n- A Next Steps section for post-upgrade actions like updating CI/CD pipelines or running integration tests\n\n## Make your app cloud ready\n\nModernization doesn’t stop at upgrading your code. Making your app cloud-ready unlocks scalability, security, and operational efficiency. Here’s how Copilot helps:\n\n### Step 1: Run a cloud readiness assessment\n\nStart by selecting Migrate to Azure from the GitHub Copilot app modernization UI.\n\n![Migrate to Azure](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/migrate-to-azure.webp)\n\nCopilot will:\n\n- Scan your project for framework compatibility and configuration gaps\n- Identify authentication and identity issues for cloud environments\n- Highlight dependency vulnerabilities that need attention\n\n![Assessment in progress](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/assessment-in-progress.webp)\n\nWhen the assessment finishes, you’ll see a detailed report along with:\n\n- A list of migration tasks in the chat window\n- Criticality ratings\n- Recommended actions\n\n![Assessment report](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/assessment-report.webp)\n\n### Step 2: Approve and execute the migration plan\n\nSimilar to the upgrade process, Copilot creates a migration plan that will:\n\n- Highlight dependency updates for Azure compatibility\n- List configuration changes for cloud services to ensure smooth deployment\n- Include security enhancements for compliance\n\n![Migration plan](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/migration-plan.webp)\n\nOnce you approve the plan, Copilot will:\n\n- Update your configuration and code\n- Add required Azure SDKs and authentication adapters\n\n![Migration complete](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/migration-success.webp)\n\n### Step 3: Validate and secure\n\nAfter code remediation, Copilot will:\n\n- Run automated CVE scans on all updated dependencies\n- Propose safe version replacements if vulnerabilities are found\n- Confirm all tests pass and build integrity is maintained\n\n### Step 4: Deploy to Azure\n\nFinally, deployment is fully automated. Copilot handles:\n\n- Provisioning resources without manual scripting\n- Configuring monitoring and logging for observability\n- Securing identities for safe access\n\nFrom code to cloud in minutes, without writing infrastructure scripts.\n\n## Try GitHub Copilot app modernization today\n\nReady to modernize your .NET apps faster?
