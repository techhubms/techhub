  "EnhancedContent": "If you’re a .NET MAUI developer publishing apps to Google Play, there’s an important requirement coming your way. Starting **November 1st, 2025**, Google Play will require all new apps and updates targeting Android 15+ to support 16 KB page sizes on 64-bit devices.\n\n## What is the 16 KB Page Size Requirement?\n\nAndroid is moving from 4 KB to 16 KB memory page sizes to optimize performance on devices with larger amounts of RAM. This change brings several system-wide benefits that Google has measured, but also advantages for the app you are building on Android:\n\n- **Lower app launch times** (3.16% improvement on average, up to 30% for some apps)\n- **Reduced power draw** during app launch (4.56% reduction on average)\n- **Improved system performance** better overall system responsiveness on the Android operating system, for instance the Android camera app has 4.48% faster hot starts, 6.60% faster cold starts\n\n## .NET MAUI Support\n\nThe good news is that .NET MAUI 9 supports 16 KB page sizes out of the box, so make sure that your .NET MAUI (and .NET for Android) app is on .NET 9 and your app should automatically be compatible with the 16 KB page size requirement.\n\nPlease note, .NET MAUI 8 is out of support as of May 14, 2025 per the [.NET MAUI support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui).\n\n## Check your dependencies\n\nAll dependencies in your .NET MAUI project also need 16 KB support. When building your app, you’ll see warnings for non-compliant dependencies:\n\n```plaintext Android 16 will require 16 KB page sizes, shared library '{library_name}' does not have a 16 KB page size. Please inform the authors of the NuGet package '{package_name}' version '{version}' which contains '{file_path}'. See https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes for more details. ```\n\nWhen you see this warning:\n\n1. **Update the dependency** to a newer version that supports 16 KB page sizes\n2. **Contact the package author** if no updated version is available\n3. **Find an alternative dependency** if the package is no longer maintained\n\nIf you want to do some additional manual checks to make sure that your app and it’s dependencies are compliant, check the [Google documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes#elf-alignment) which offers some command-line scripts that can help with that.\n\n## What you need to do\n\nHere’s your action plan for the November 2025 deadline:\n\n1. **Upgrade to .NET 9** if you haven’t already\n2. **Check your dependencies** for 16 KB compatibility\n3. **Update or replace** any non-compliant dependencies\n4. **Test your app** in a 16 KB environment using Android emulators or using the developer options on your Android device\n\n**Important**\n\nDon’t wait until the November deadline. Start preparing now to ensure your app submissions meet Google Play policy requirements and you can continue to release without interruption.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe 16 KB page size requirement brings performance benefits but requires preparation. With .NET MAUI 9, the framework is ready – you just need to ensure your dependencies are too. Upgrade to .NET 9, audit your dependencies, and test in 16 KB environments to be prepared for the November 2025 deadline.\n\n## References\n\n- [Android 16 KB Page Size Support Guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes)\n- [.NET MAUI Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/maui)\n- [Google Play 16 KB Page Size Blog Post](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/prepare-play-apps-for-devices-with-16kb-page-size.html)\n- [.NET for Android repository issue](https://github.com/dotnet/android/issues/10477)",
