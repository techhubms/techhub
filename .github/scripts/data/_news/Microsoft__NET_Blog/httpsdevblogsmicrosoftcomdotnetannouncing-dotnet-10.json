Stephen Toub’s [performance improvements deep dive](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-10/) highlights the latest optimizations.\n\n**Key improvements:**\n\n- **[JIT compiler enhancements](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/runtime#jit-compiler-improvements)**: Better inlining, method devirtualization, and improved code generation for struct arguments\n- **Hardware acceleration**: [AVX10.2 support](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/runtime#avx102-support) for cutting-edge Intel silicon, Arm64 SVE for advanced vectorization with [Arm64 write-barrier improvements](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/runtime#arm64-write-barrier-improvements) reducing GC pause times by 8-20%\n- **[NativeAOT improvements](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/runtime#nativeaot-type-preinitializer-improvements)**: Smaller, faster ahead-of-time compiled apps\n- **Runtime optimizations**: [Enhanced loop inversion and stack allocation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/runtime#stack-allocation) strategies deliver measurable performance gains\n\n## C# 14 & F# 10\n\n[C# 14](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-14) and [F# 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/whats-new/fsharp-10) deliver powerful language improvements that make your code more concise and expressive. C# continues to be one of the world’s most popular programming languages, [ranking in the top 5 in the 2025 GitHub Octoverse report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/).\n\n### C# 14 highlights\n\n**Field-backed properties** simplify property declarations by eliminating the need for explicit backing fields. The compiler generates the backing field automatically, making your code cleaner and more maintainable:\n\n```csharp // Automatic backing field with custom logic public string Name { get => field; set => field = value?.Trim() ?? string.Empty; } ```\n\n**Extension properties and methods** enable adding members to types you don’t own-including interfaces and static members-making extension types far more powerful. You can now create extension properties that work seamlessly with types throughout your codebase:\n\n```csharp // Extension properties for any type static class ListExtensions { extension(List<int> @this) { public int Sum => @this.Aggregate(0, (a, b) => a + b); } } ```\n\n**Additional C# 14 features:**\n\n- **First-class `Span<T>` conversions**: Implicit conversion support for high-performance span operations\n- **Null-conditional assignment**: `?.=`\noperator for cleaner null-safe assignment code\n- **Parameter modifiers in lambdas**: Use `ref`\n, `in` , or `out` parameters without explicit types\n- **Collection expression extensions**: `.._expression_`\nto `params` and `[.._expression_]` spread syntax\n- **Enhanced overload resolution**: `[OverloadResolutionPriority]`\nattribute for better method selection\n- **Partial properties and constructors**: Complete the partial members story with properties, constructors, and events\n- **`ref struct` interface implementations**: Better performance with zero-allocation patterns\n\n### F# 10 highlights\n\n[F# 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/whats-new/fsharp-10) is a refinement release focused on clarity, consistency, and performance with meaningful improvements for everyday code.\n\n**Language improvements:**\n\n- **Scoped warning suppression**: Use `#warnon`\npaired with `#nowarn` to enable or disable warnings within specific code sections, giving you precise control over compiler diagnostics\n- **Access modifiers on auto property accessors**: Create publicly readable but privately mutable properties without verbose backing fields (`member val Balance = 0m with public get, private set`\n)\n- **`ValueOption` optional parameters**: Apply `[<Struct>]`\nattribute to optional parameters to use struct-based `ValueOption<'T>` instead of heap-allocated `option` , eliminating allocations in performance-critical code\n- **Tail-call support in computation expressions**: Builders can now opt into tail-call optimizations with `ReturnFromFinal`\nand `YieldFromFinal` methods\n- **Typed bindings without parentheses**: Write natural type annotations like `let! x: int = fetchA()`\nin computation expressions without parentheses\n\n**Core library & performance:**\n\n- **`and!` in task expressions**: Concurrently await multiple tasks with idiomatic syntax: `let! a = fetchA() and! b = fetchB()`\n- **Type subsumption cache**: Faster compilation and IDE responsiveness through memoized type relationship checks\n- **Parallel compilation preview**: Graph-based type checking, parallel IL code generation, and parallel optimization enabled by default with `LangVersion=Preview`\n- **Better trimming by default**: Auto-generated substitutions remove F# metadata resources for smaller published apps\n\nRead more about these features, as well as improvements to computation expression bindings, attribute target enforcement, deprecation warnings for omitted `seq` , and more in the [What’s New in F# 10 documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fsharp/whats-new/fsharp-10).\n\n## .NET Libraries – Secure, Modern APIs\n\n.NET 10 libraries deliver important updates across cryptography, networking, serialization, and more-making apps more secure and efficient.\n\n### Post-Quantum Cryptography\n\n**Note**\n\nQuantum computing advances make post-quantum cryptography increasingly important. .NET 10’s expanded PQC support helps future-proof your applications against quantum threats while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.\n\n.NET 10 expands [post-quantum cryptography (PQC) support](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/libraries#cryptography):\n\n- **Windows CNG support**: Use ML-DSA and ML-KEM algorithms with Windows cryptography APIs\n- **Enhanced ML-DSA**: HashML-DSA variant for improved security characteristics\n- **Composite ML-DSA**: Hybrid approaches combining traditional and quantum-resistant algorithms for defense-in-depth\n\n### Enhanced Networking\n\nNetworking improvements make apps faster and more capable:\n\n- **[`WebSocketStream`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/libraries#websocket-enhancements)**: Simplified WebSocket API that’s easier to use and more efficient\n- **[TLS 1.3 on macOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/libraries#tls-enhancements)**: Modern TLS support across all major platforms\n- **Windows process group support**: Better process management on Windows\n- **Performance optimizations**: Reduced allocations and improved throughput across HTTP, sockets, and WebSockets\n\n### Additional library improvements\n\n- **JSON enhancements**: Disallow duplicate properties for safer deserialization, enhanced serialization settings, `PipeReader`\nsupport for high-performance scenarios\n- **[Cryptography updates](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/libraries#cryptography)**: AES KeyWrap with Padding for secure key wrapping in compliance scenarios\n- **System updates**: Improved diagnostics, better interop with native code, enhanced collections\n\nLearn more in [What’s new in .NET Libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-10/libraries).\n\n## Aspire – Orchestrate front ends, APIs, containers, and databases effortlessly\n\n[Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/) makes building observable, production-ready distributed apps straightforward with built-in telemetry, service discovery, and cloud integrations. **Aspire 13** ships with .NET 10 with major improvements for polyglot development, modern workflows, and enterprise deployment.\n\n**Key highlights:**\n\n- **Modern development experience**: CLI enhancements, single-file AppHost support for streamlined project organization, and quicker onboarding with simplified templates\n- **Seamless build & deployment**: Built-in static file site support for frontend apps, robust deployment parallelization for faster releases, and production-ready container workflows\n- **Enterprise-ready infrastructure**: Flexible connection strings and certificate trust management that works consistently across your applications\n\n**Additional features:**\n\n- **[Simplified AppHost SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dotnet-aspire-sdk)**: Set `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk`\nas the sole project SDK\n- **AddCSharpApp support**: New `CSharpAppResource`\nand `AddCSharpApp` alternatives to `AddProject`\n- **Enhanced security**: Encoded parameters for sensitive configuration data, customizable resource certificate trust\n- **[Dashboard improvements](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/overview)**: OpenID Connect claims configuration for flexible authentication\n\n**Working with other platforms:**\n\nWhen your .NET applications need to integrate with services written in Python, JavaScript, or other languages, Aspire 13 makes this seamless.

Companies like H&R Block, Blip, and KPMG use .NET for their AI solutions, and the new Microsoft Copilot is built with .NET.\n\n![.NET AI diagram](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/dotnet-ai-diagram.svg)\n\n### Microsoft Agent Framework – Build Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems\n\nThe [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-preview/) simplifies building intelligent, agentic AI systems by combining the best of Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into a unified experience. Whether you’re building a single AI agent or orchestrating multiple agents working together, the framework provides the patterns and infrastructure you need.\n\nCreate sophisticated AI workflows with minimal code:\n\n```csharp // Create agents with minimal code AIAgent writer = new ChatClientAgent( chatClient, new ChatClientAgentOptions { Name = \"Writer\", Instructions = \"Write engaging, creative stories.\" });\n\n// Orchestrate in workflows AIAgent editor = new ChatClientAgent(chatClient, /* ... */); Workflow workflow = AgentWorkflowBuilder.BuildSequential(writer, editor); AIAgent workflowAgent = await workflow.AsAgentAsync(); ```\n\nThe framework supports multiple workflow patterns to match your application’s needs:\n\n- **Sequential workflows**: Agents execute in a defined order, with each agent’s output feeding into the next\n- **Concurrent workflows**: Multiple agents work in parallel for faster processing\n- **Handoff workflows**: Agents dynamically pass control based on context and requirements\n- **Group chat**: Agents collaborate through conversation to solve complex problems\n- **Magentic**: A dedicated manager coordinates a team of specialized agents\n\nIntegrate tools seamlessly, whether they’re simple C# functions or full Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The framework is production-ready with built-in support for dependency injection, middleware pipelines, and OpenTelemetry for observability.\n\nYou can quickly get started with building server hosted agents with Microsoft Agent Framework and ASP.NET Core using the new AI Agent Web API template (`aiagent-webapi` ) available in the [Microsoft.Agents.AI.ProjectTemplates](https://nuget.org/packages/microsoft.agents.ai.projecttemplates) template package.\n\n```console dotnet new install Microsoft.Agents.AI.ProjectTemplates dotnet new aiagent-webapi -o MyAIAgentWebApi cd MyAIAgentWebApi dotnet run ```\n\nThis creates an ASP.NET Core Web API project that hosts your agents and exposes them as standard HTTP endpoints. It includes the Microsoft Agent Framework Dev UI, providing a web-based test harness to validate and visualize agents and workflows through an interactive interface.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/microsoft-agent-framework-dev-ui.webm](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/microsoft-agent-framework-dev-ui.webm)\n\nMicrosoft Agent Framework now supports the AG-UI protocol for building rich agent user interfaces. [AG-UI](https://ag-ui.com) is a light-weight event-based protocol for human-agent interactions that makes it easy to build streaming UIs, frontend tool calling, shared state management, and other agentic UI experiences. Check out various AG-UI enabled scenarios with Microsoft Agent Framework using the [AG-UI Dojo](https://dojo.ag-ui.com) sample app.\n\nUse the new [Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.agents.ai.hosting.agui.aspnetcore) package to easily map AG-UI endpoints for your agents.\n\n```csharp // Map an AG-UI endpoint for the publisher agent at /publisher/ag-ui app.MapAGUI(\"publisher/ag-ui\", publisherAgent) ```\n\nYou can then use existing AG-UI client frameworks, like [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai), to quickly build rich user experiences for your agents. Or, use the new .NET AG-UI chat client in the [Microsoft.Agents.AI.AGUI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/microsoft.agents.ai.agui) package to build your own UI experiences using your favorite .NET UI framework, like .NET MAUI or Blazor.\n\n```csharp IChatClient aguiChatClient = new AGUIChatClient(httpClient, \"publisher/ag-ui); ```\n\nSee [AG-UI Agents](https://aka.ms/maf/ag-ui) to learn more about getting started with Microsoft Agent Framework and AG-UI.\n\n### Microsoft.Extensions.AI – Unified Building Blocks for AI Applications\n\n[Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-microsoft-extensions-ai-preview/) and [Microsoft.Extensions.VectorData](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-microsoft-extensions-vector-data/) provide unified abstractions for integrating AI services into your applications. The `IChatClient` interface works with any provider-OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Models, Ollama-through a consistent API, making it easy to switch providers or support multiple backends without rewriting your code.\n\n```csharp // Use any AI provider with the same interface IChatClient chatClient = new AzureOpenAIClient(endpoint, credential) .AsChatClient(\"gpt-4o\");\n\nvar response = await chatClient.CompleteAsync(\"Explain quantum computing\"); Console.WriteLine(response.Message); ```\n\nThe unified abstractions support:\n\n- **Provider flexibility**: Switch between AI providers without code changes\n- **Middleware pipeline**: Add caching, logging, or custom behavior to any AI call\n- **Dependency injection**: Register AI services using familiar .NET patterns\n- **Telemetry**: Built-in OpenTelemetry support for monitoring AI usage\n- **Vector data**: Unified abstractions for vector databases and semantic search\n\nThese building blocks work seamlessly with the Microsoft Agent Framework, Semantic Kernel, and your own AI implementations.\n\n### Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Extend AI Agents with Tools and Services\n\n.NET provides first-class [MCP support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/mcp-server-dotnet-nuget-quickstart/) to extend AI agents with external tools and services. The Model Context Protocol enables AI agents to access data sources, APIs, and tools in a standardized way, making your agents more capable and versatile.\n\n[Install the .NET AI templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/quickstarts/build-mcp-server#create-the-project) and use the MCP server template to quickly build and publish MCP servers:\n\n```bash dotnet new install Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Templates dotnet new mcpserver -n MyMcpServer ```\n\nOnce built, publish your MCP server to NuGet for easy consumption across your organization or the broader .NET community. The [C# MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) has regular releases to implement the [latest protocol updates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/mcp-csharp-sdk-2025-06-18-update/), ensuring compatibility with the growing MCP ecosystem.\n\n**MCP enables AI agents to:**\n\n- Access databases and APIs securely\n- Execute commands and workflows\n- Read and modify files\n- Integrate with business systems\n- Use specialized tools and services\n\nBy standardizing how AI agents interact with external resources, MCP makes it easier to build, share, and compose AI capabilities across the .NET ecosystem.\n\nGet started with our [AI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/) and [AI samples](https://github.com/dotnet/ai-samples).\n\n## ASP.NET Core – Secure, High-Performance Web Apps and APIs\n\n[ASP.NET Core](https://asp.net) in .NET 10 includes everything you need to build secure, high-performance web applications and APIs.
