We’ve recently released [CodeQL 2.23.6](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.23.6/), which adds support for Swift 6.2.1, promotes two C# cookie security queries, and includes various accuracy improvements across languages.\n\n## Language and framework support\n\n- **Swift**: CodeQL now supports analysis of apps built with Swift 6.2.1.\n- **Rust**: We’ve added models for cookie methods in the `poem`\ncrate.\n\n## Query changes\n\n- **C#**:\n- The `cs/web/cookie-secure-not-set`\nand `cs/web/cookie-httponly-not-set` queries have been promoted from experimental to the main query pack. These queries detect cookies created without proper security attributes.\n- We’ve improved the Guards library for recognizing disjunctions, resulting in improved precision for `cs/constant-condition`\n, `cs/inefficient-containskey` , and `cs/dereferenced-value-may-be-null` queries.\n- **Rust**: We’ve added taint flow barriers to the `rust/regex-injection`\n, `rust/sql-injection` , and `rust/log-injection` queries, reducing the frequency of false positive results.\n- **Java/Kotlin**: We’ve reduced the `security-severity`\nscore of `java/overly-large-range` and `java/insecure-cookie` from 5.0 to 4.0 to better reflect their impact.\n- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: We’ve increased the `security-severity`\nscore of `js/xss-through-dom` from 6.1 to 7.8 to align with other XSS queries, and reduced the score of `js/overly-large-range` from 5.0 to 4.0.\n- **Python**: We’ve reduced the `security-severity`\nscore of `py/overly-large-range` from 5.0 to 4.0 to better reflect its impact.\n- **Ruby**: We’ve reduced the `security-severity`\nscore of `rb/overly-large-range` from 5.0 to 4.0 to better reflect its impact.\n\nFor a full list of changes, please refer to the complete [changelog for version 2.23.6](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.23.6/). Every new version of CodeQL is automatically deployed to users of GitHub code scanning on github.com. The new functionality in CodeQL 2.23.6 will also be included in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) 3.20 release. If you use an older version of GHES, you can [manually upgrade your CodeQL version](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.17/admin/managing-code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access).",
