[Git Merge 2025](https://git-merge.com/) marked 20 years of Git with technical talks, community collaboration, and the kind of hallway chats you canâ€™t capture in slides. More than 100 people joined us in person, and over 600 tuned in online.\n\n## Day 1: Talks for everyone\n\nFrom deep dives into Git internals to beginner-friendly sessions on creative workflows, this yearâ€™s program offered something for everyone. We heard from maintainers, educators, hobbyists, and even a high school student, sharing how Git shapes their work and learning. Speakers joined both in person and remotely from around the globe, making this one of our most accessible and inclusive Git Merge events yet.\n\n![People seated around a long conference table at GitHub HQ&rsquo;s Executive Briefing Center during the Git Contributors Summit.

Core maintainers and contributors met, both in person and remotely, to shape Gitâ€™s roadmap for the year ahead in one of our most remote-friendly gatherings yet.\n\n![People seated around a long conference table at GitHub HQ&rsquo;s Executive Briefing Center during the Git Contributors Summit.

From the speakers who shared their work, to the contributors and volunteers who gave their time, to every attendee who showed up ready to learn and connectâ€¦ thank you.\n\nHuge thanks to the GitHub teams behind the scenes who made the event seamless for attendees around the world.\n\nAnd a special thanks to our sponsors, [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/), for helping bring this yearâ€™s celebration to life.\n\nUntil the next Git Merge, keep committing. &lt;3\n\n[**Catch up on the talks from Git Merge 2025 &gt;**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNXkW_le40U6Ms1XlsYKi_yUh5J2FOSlf)",
