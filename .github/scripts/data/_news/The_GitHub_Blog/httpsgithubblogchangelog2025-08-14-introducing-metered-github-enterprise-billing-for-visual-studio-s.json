  "EnhancedContent": "Scaling your GitHub usage just got easier. Customers on the [Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise bundle](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-licenses-for-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise/about-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise) now have the option to transition to [pay-as-you-go, usage-based billing](https://resources.github.com/metered-billing/) for GitHub Enterprise (GHE).\n\nThis gives you the flexibility of usage-based billing for GHE while giving administrators enhanced tooling to manage license assignment and compliance.\n\n### What’s new\n\nEnterprise administrators on the Visual Studio bundle have greater control over managing license assignments under **Billing and licensing &gt; Licensing &gt; Enterprise Cloud &gt; Manage**, enabling them to:\n\n- Leverage metered billing for GHE-only consumption, with improved visibility into usage by license type\n- Simplify compliance auditing using automated email matching and being able to manually correct mismatches where needed\n- Automate license assignment and user matching via new public APIs (please contact your account team for enrollment)\n\n### How it works\n\n- By default, new users added to your enterprise with an email that matches a Visual Studio subscriber will not consume a metered Enterprise license.\n- If your Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise license allocation is fully assigned, additional users will default to GHE-only metering.\n- The new licensing view lets administrators audit and align GitHub user accounts with corresponding Visual Studio subscribers.\n\n### Availability\n\n- This release will gradually start to roll out across the next few days and is currently only available for github.com, with plans to extend support to GitHub’s data residency regions.\n- Existing Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise customers on subscription-based plans can opt to transition to the new model at renewal. Please contact your GitHub or Microsoft account team for assistance.\n- If you’re interested in using the new APIs to automate the user mapping between Visual Studio and GitHub Enterprise licenses, contact your account team for enrollment.\n\nTo learn more about Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, visit [our documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-licenses-for-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise/about-visual-studio-subscriptions-with-github-enterprise).\n\n### Feedback\n\nTo provide feedback, ask questions, and see a list of known issues, visit the GitHub Community [feedback discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/163962).",
