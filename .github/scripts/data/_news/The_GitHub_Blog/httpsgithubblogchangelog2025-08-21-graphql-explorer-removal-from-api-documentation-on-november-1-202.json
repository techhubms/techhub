  "EnhancedContent": "## What’s changing\n\nWe will retire the [GraphQL Explorer](https://docs.github.com/graphql/overview/explorer) on November 1, 2025. At that point, we’ll remove the interactive `iframe` that previously allowed you to preview and experiment with the GitHub GraphQL API. As a replacement, we’re providing a guide on how to set up your preferred development tools to introspect and evaluate the GitHub GraphQL schema.\n\n## Who this affects\n\nThis change affects a few users who utilized the GraphQL Explorer for experimenting with the GitHub GraphQL API. Most users will not need to take any action.\n\n## Why this change matters\n\nThe GraphQL Explorer offers limited capabilities and is not intended as a development tool. We’re empowering developers to use robust tools that best fit their workflows when working with our GraphQL API.\n\n## What you should do\n\nIf you currently use the GraphQL Explorer, we recommend transitioning to a local development tool for working with the GitHub GraphQL API. The updated documentation will include guidance on getting started with popular GraphQL clients.\n\n## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about working with the GitHub GraphQL API, see our [GraphQL API documentation](https://docs.github.com/graphql).\n\nHave feedback or questions? Join the conversation in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).\n\n*This change supports our ongoing commitment to make GitHub’s APIs faster, more scalable, and easier to use for everyone.*",
