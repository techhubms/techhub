  "EnhancedContent": "We’ve introduced enhanced authentication capabilities in GitHub Copilot plugins for JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode to support more third-party OAuth providers with a secure and flexible approach using Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) and fallback mechanisms.\n\n## What’s new\n\nGitHub Copilot plugins for JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode now support authentication for more identity providers (IdPs) beyond the GitHub MCP server, using OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 2.1 standards.\n\nMCP first attempts a Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) handshake for automatic client setup. If the IdP does not support DCR, Copilot falls back to a client-credentials workflow, allowing you to manually configure static client IDs and secrets. These improvements give developers greater flexibility to integrate enterprise IdPs or custom identity services while maintaining security and compliance.\n\n## Try it out\n\nThese enhancements are in preview and available today to all [JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot), [Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/github-copilot), and [Xcode](https://github.com/github/copilotforXcode/) users. You need to update the plugin or app to the latest version and will also need to have a valid [Copilot license](https://github.com/features/copilot).\n\nFor more details on MCP authentication, please refer to the official [documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization).\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nWe value your feedback!
