These updates bring more context options, smoother workflows, and better customization for your development experience.\n\n## âœ¨ Whatâ€™s new\n\n**Custom instructions**\n\nYou can now use custom instructions to provide Copilot with additional context tailored to your work. This helps Copilot deliver more relevant and personalized assistance. Learn more in [our documentation about custom instructions](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions?tool=eclipse).\n\n![Demo of custom instructions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9456fdb6-0629-4c7a-b896-b4cfafd05a2f)\n\n> >\n> Note: The custom instructions feature is currently available only in Chat and Agent mode.\n> >\n\n**Image support in chat context**\n\nYou can now add images directly to the chat context to generate code snippets. For example, you can upload a hand-drawn layout page, and Copilot will generate corresponding HTML code.\n\n![Demo of Copilot Vision](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2a6fb2-9d9e-416d-bae2-f7751e2fce0d)\n\n> >\n> Note: Some models do not support vision capabilities. In such cases, Copilot displays a warning.\n> >\n\n**Richer context with folders and resources**\n\nYou can now enrich Copilot chat by referencing context with folders and resources. This makes it easier to share structured project content and collaborate more effectively:\n\n- Attach folders directly into chat to provide broader project context.\n- Drag and drop resources into referenced files for quick additions.\n\n![Demo of drag and drop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/626c308c-59f1-4c4b-9cd6-cb73edaead14)\n- Add resources via context menu in Package Explorer and Project Explorer.\n\n![Demo of context menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8ead47e-b519-46d5-8019-57ee85206a01)\n\n**Improved user experience**\n\nWeâ€™ve refined both the Agent Mode workflow and the chat view to make them more intuitive and user-friendly:\n\n- A confirmation dialog now appears when starting a new Agent mode conversation if there are unhandled files in context, preventing accidental data loss.\n- The chat view banner now displays the conversation title and includes a shortcut to **Edit Preferencesâ€¦**\n- A refreshed color design improves readability and provides a cleaner look.\n- The Copilot Chat view is now included in JEE-related perspectives by default, improving integration across development workflows.\n- A new configuration scope controls whether to show the Whatâ€™s New page. This option is now also exposed in the Preferences dialog.\n- Enhanced colors and layout for chat view with dark theme and light theme improvements.\n\n![Demo of dark theme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08919bb8-337b-4557-ba64-6325d3a64835)\n\n![Demo of light theme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee18c99a-0570-4cfc-a8c7-b1ebd7cc2aee)\n\n**Reduced plugin size**\n\nBy splitting platform-specific binaries into separate fragments, the overall plugin size has been greatly reduced. This means faster downloads and updates.\n\n**New public API to programmatically start a chat session**\n\nWeâ€™ve introduced a new public API that allows other plugins to seamlessly start a new ask session in the Copilot Chat view. Plugins can now invoke the `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.commands.openChatView` command with two optional parameters:\n\n- `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.commands.openChatView.inputValue`\n: A string representing the initial content of the chat.\n- `com.microsoft.copilot.eclipse.commands.openChatView.autoSend`\n: A boolean indicating whether to automatically submit the content.\n\nThis opens up exciting possibilities for plugin developers to trigger contextual Copilot interactions directly from their tools.\n\nHereâ€™s how the Spring Tools plugin leverages the new API to launch a chat session:\n\n![Demo of Spring Tool API](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a7f5b80-5d13-4bc2-be0d-082031f94fb1)\n\n## ðŸ›  Try it out\n\nGet started by checking out our [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/chat/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide?tool=eclipse).\n\n## ðŸ’¬ Share your feedback\n\nYour feedback drives improvements.
