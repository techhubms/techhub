  "EnhancedContent": "We’ve improved the GitHub Projects onboarding flow to help you get started faster, with options to connect and import items from a repository, set a default repository for new issues, use new default workflows to set up your project, and more.\n\n## 🚀 Key improvements\n\n**Import items from a repository**\n\n[https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/import_items.mp4#t=0.001](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/import_items.mp4#t=0.001)\n\nDuring onboarding, you can now choose to import open issues, open pull requests, or both from a specified repository. The selected items are automatically imported when the project is created, so you can start with your existing content right away.\n\n**Set a default repository**\n\n[https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/default_repo.mp4#t=0.001](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/default_repo.mp4#t=0.001)\n\nIn project settings, you can now select a default repository. All new issues created in this project will be automatically associated with the selected repository.\n\n**Pull request linked to issue workflow**\n\n[https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/linked_PRs_workflow.mp4#t=0.001](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/linked_PRs_workflow.mp4#t=0.001)\n\nA new default workflow, **Pull request linked to issue**, automatically sets the status of an issue to “In progress” whenever a linked pull request exists.\n\n## 🛠 Additional onboarding improvements\n\n- New projects now show **linked pull requests and sub-issues** as default fields.\n- The **Team planning template** now defaults to Table view instead of Board view.\n- **Insights** and **Workflows** buttons have been elevated in the UI for easier discovery.\n- Polishing and minor fixes to make onboarding smoother and more reliable.\n\n## 🤖 API improvements\n\nWe’ve made improvements to the Projects GraphQL API making it easier to automate your project workflows.\n\n- You’ll now see [`project_v2_item_status_changed`](https://docs.github.com/graphql/reference/objects#projectv2itemstatuschangedevent), [`added_to_project_v2`](https://docs.github.com/graphql/reference/objects#addedtoprojectv2event), [`removed_from_project_v2`](https://docs.github.com/graphql/reference/objects#removedfromprojectv2event), and [`converted_from_draft`](https://docs.github.com/graphql/reference/objects#convertedfromdraftevent) events. These events allow you to understand information such as how long an item was “In progress” before moving to “Done”.\n- You can filter project items using the `query`\nargument with any project filter. Check out the [ProjectsV2 GraphQL documentation](https://docs.github.com/graphql/reference/objects#projectv2) for more details.\n\n## ✍ Tell us what you think!\n\nJoin the conversation in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/178930), or select **Give feedback** from the project **…** menu to share your thoughts.",
