In addition to previously announced validators, GitHub is adding validity check support for the following token types:\n\n| Provider | Pattern | Validity | | --- | --- | --- | | Bitrise | `bitrise_workspace_api_token` | ✓ | | Groq | `groq_api_key` | ✓ | | Siemens | `siemens_api_token` | ✓ | | Square | `square_access_token`<br>\\* | ✓ | | Uniwise | `wiseflow_api_key` | ✓ | | Wakatime | `wakatime_api_key` | ✓ | | Wakatime | `wakatime_oauth_access_token` | ✓ | | WorkOS | `workos_staging_api_key` | ✓ | | WorkOS | `workos_production_api_key` | ✓ | | Yandex | `yandex_cloud_iam_token` | ✓ |\n\n*\\* Validation is available for the following token versions: Square Access Token, Legacy Production Access Token, and Legacy Sandbox Access Token.*\n\n### What are validity checks?\n\nValidity checks indicate if the leaked credentials are active and could still be exploited. If you’ve previously enabled validity checks for a given repository, GitHub will now automatically verify validity for alerts on supported token types. View the full list of supported secret types in our [product documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns#default-patterns).",
