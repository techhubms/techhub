Or [link your trusted social login email](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) with your existing GitHub accounts, securing them further by eliminating the need to create and manage a separate GitHub password. For enhanced security, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) and adding a passkey or a password for account recovery.\n\nCreate your free GitHub account using your trusted Apple identity and start coding with Copilot today!\n\nLearn more about [authentication with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github).\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
