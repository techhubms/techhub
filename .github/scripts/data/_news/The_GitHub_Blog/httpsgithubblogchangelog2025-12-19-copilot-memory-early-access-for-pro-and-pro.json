Over time, Copilot builds a repository-specific memory by capturing key insights about your codebase and using them to improve how agents assist you. This shared context helps Copilot perform better across coding and code review workflows.\n\n### Get started today\n\nCopilot Pro and Pro+ users can enable Copilot Memory by navigating to **Settings &gt; Copilot** and turning on **Copilot Memory**.\n\n### Share your feedback\n\nWe’re continuing to evolve Copilot Memory and plan to bring it to more plans in the future.
