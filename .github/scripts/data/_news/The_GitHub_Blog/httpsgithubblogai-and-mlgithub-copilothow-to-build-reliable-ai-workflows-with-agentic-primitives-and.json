  "EnhancedContent": "Many developers begin their AI explorations with a prompt. Perhaps you started the same way: You opened [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=blog-copilot-features-oct-2025&amp;utm_campaign=agentic-copilot-cli-launch-2025), started asking questions in natural language, and hoped for a usable output. This approach can work for simple fixes and code suggestions, but as your needs get more complex‚Äîor as your work gets more collaborative‚Äîyou‚Äôre going to need a more foolproof strategy.\n\nThis guide will introduce you to a three-part framework that transforms this ad-hoc style of AI experimentation into a repeatable and reliable engineering practice. At its core are two concepts: agentic primitives, which are reusable, configurable building blocks that enable AI agents to work systematically; and context engineering, which ensures your AI agents always focus on the *right* information. By familiarizing yourself with these concepts, you‚Äôll be able to build AI systems that can not only code independently, but do so reliably, predictably, and consistently.\n\n![An AI-native development framework, showing spec-driven development and agent workflows at the top, context engineering (including roles, rules, context, and memory) below, and prompt engineering (including role activation, context loading, tool invocation, and validation gates) at the base.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1_6a15dc.png?resize=1024%2C618)**The AI-native development framework** Markdown prompt engineering + agent primitives + context engineering = reliability\n\nWhether you‚Äôre new to AI-native development or looking to bring deeper reliability to your agent workflows, this guide will give you the foundation you need to build, scale, and share intelligent systems that learn and improve with every use.\n\n## What are agent primitives?\n\nThe three-layer framework below turns ad-hoc AI experimentation into a reliable, repeatable process. It does this by combining the structure of Markdown; the power of agent primitives, simple building blocks that give your AI agents clear instructions and capabilities; and smart context management, so your agents always get the right information (not just *more* information).\n\n### Layer 1: Use Markdown for more strategic prompt engineering\n\nWe‚Äôve written about the [importance of prompt engineering](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/prompt-engineering-guide-generative-ai-llms/). But here‚Äôs what you need to know: The clearer, more precise, more context-rich your prompt, the better, more accurate your outcome. This is where Markdown comes in. With Markdown‚Äôs structure (its headers, lists, and links), you can naturally guide AI‚Äôs reasoning, making outputs more predictable and consistent.\n\nTo provide a strong foundation for your prompt engineering, try these techniques with Markdown as your guide:\n\n- **Context loading**: `[Review existing patterns](./src/patterns/)`\n. In this case, links become context injection points that pull in relevant information, either from files or websites.\n- **Structured thinking**: Use headers and bullets to create clear reasoning pathways for the AI to follow.\n- **Role activation**: Use phrases like ‚ÄúYou are an expert [in this role].‚Äù This triggers specialized knowledge domains and will focus the AI‚Äôs responses.\n- **Tool integration**: *Use MCP tool `tool-name`.* This lets your AI agent run code in a controlled, repeatable, and [predictable way on MCP servers](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/meet-the-github-mcp-registry-the-fastest-way-to-discover-mcp-servers/).\n- **Precise language**: Eliminate ambiguity through specific instructions.\n- **Validation gates**: ‚ÄúStop and get user approval.‚Äù Make sure there is always human oversight at critical decision points.\n\nFor example, instead of saying, `Find and fix the bug` , use the following:\n\n``` You are an expert debugger, specialized in debugging complex programming issues.\n\nYou are particularly great at debugging this project, which architecture and quirks can be consulted in the [architecture document](./docs/architecture.md).\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Review the [error logs](./logs/error.log) and identify the root cause.\n\n2. Use the `azmcp-monitor-log-query` MCP tool to retrieve infrastructure logs from Azure.\n\n3. Once you find the root cause, think about 3 potential solutions with trade-offs\n\n4. Present your root cause analysis and suggested solutions with trade-offs to the user and seek validation before proceeding with fixes - do not change any files.\n```\n\nOnce you‚Äôre comfortable with structured prompting, you‚Äôll quickly realize that manually crafting perfect prompts for every task is unsustainable. (Who has the time?) This is where the second step comes in: turning your prompt engineering insights into reusable, configurable systems.\n\n### Layer 2: Agentic primitives: Deploying your new prompt engineering techniques\n\nNow it‚Äôs time to implement all of your new strategies more systematically, instead of prompting ad hoc. These configurable tools will help you do just that.\n\n#### Core agent primitives\n\nWhen it comes to AI-native development, a [core agent primitive](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/concepts/#core-primitives) refers to a simple, reusable file or module that provides a specific capability or rule for an agent.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n- **Instructions files**: Deploy structured guidance through modular `.instructions.md`\nfiles with targeted scope. At GitHub, we offer [custom instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions) to give Copilot repository-specific guidance and preferences.\n- **Chat modes**: Deploy role-based expertise through `.chatmode.md`\nfiles with MCP tool boundaries that prevent security breaches and cross-domain interference. For example, professional licenses that keep architects from building and engineers from planning.\n- **Agentic workflows**: Deploy reusable prompts through `.prompt.md`\nfiles with built-in validation.\n- **Specification files**: Create implementation-ready blueprints through `.spec.md`\nfiles that ensure repeatable results, whether the work is done by a person or by AI.\n- **Agent memory files**: Preserve knowledge across sessions through `.memory.md`\nfiles.\n- **Context helper files**: Optimize information retrieval through `.context.md`\nfiles.\n\nThis transformation might seem complex, but notice the pattern: What started as an ad-hoc request became a systematic workflow with clear handoff points, automatic context loading, and built-in validation.\n\nWhen you use these files and modules, you can keep adjusting and improving how your AI agent works at every step. Every time you iterate, you make your agent a little more reliable and consistent. And this isn‚Äôt just random trial and error ‚Äî you‚Äôre following a structured, repeatable approach that helps you get better and more predictable results every time you use the AI.\n\n| üí° **Native VS Code support**: While VS Code natively supports `.instructions.md`<br>, `.prompt.md`<br>, and `.chatmode.md`<br> files, this framework takes things further with `.spec.md`<br>, `.memory.md`<br>, and `.context.md`<br> patterns that unlock even more exciting possibilities AI-powered software development. | | --- |\n\nWith your prompts structured and your agentic primitives set up, you may encounter a new challenge: Even the best prompts and primitives can fail when they‚Äôre faced with irrelevant context or they‚Äôre competing for limited AI attention. The third layer, which we‚Äôll get to next, addresses this through strategic context management.\n\n### Layer 3: Context engineering: Helping your AI agents focus on what matters\n\nJust like people, LLMs have finite limited memory (context windows), and can sometimes be forgetful. If you can be strategic about the context you give them, you can help them focus on what‚Äôs relevant and enable them to get started and work quicker. This helps them preserve valuable context window space and improve their reliability and effectiveness.\n\nHere are some techniques to make sure they get the right context‚Äîthis is called context engineering:\n\n- **Session splitting**: Use distinct agent sessions for different development phases and tasks. For example, use one session for planning, one for implementation, and one for testing. If an agent has fresh context, it‚Äôll have better focus. It‚Äôs always better to have a fresh context window for complex tasks.\n- **Modular and custom rules and instructions**: Apply only relevant instructions through targeted `.instructions.md`\nfiles using `applyTo` YAML frontmatter syntax. This preserves context space for actual work and reduces irrelevant suggestions.\n- **Memory-driven development**: Leverage agent memory through `.memory.md`\nfiles to maintain project knowledge and decisions across sessions and time.\n- **Context optimization**: Use `.context.md`\ncontext helper files strategically to accelerate information retrieval and reduce cognitive load.\n- **Cognitive focus optimization**: Use chat modes in `.chatmode.md`\nfiles to keep the AI‚Äôs attention on relevant domains and prevent cross-domain interference. Less context pollution means you‚Äôll have more consistent and accurate outputs.\n\n## Agentic workflows: The complete system in action\n\nNow that you understand all three layers, you can see how they combine into **agentic workflows**‚Äîcomplete, systematic processes where all of your agentic primitives are working together, understanding your prompts, and using only the context they need.\n\nThese **agentic workflows** can be implemented as `.prompt.md` files that coordinate multiple agentic primitives into processes, designed to work whether executed locally in your IDE, in your terminal or in your CI pipelines.\n\n## Tooling: how to scale agent primitives\n\nNow that you understand the three-layer framework and that the agentic primitives are essentially executable software written in natural language, the question is: How can you scale these Markdown files beyond your individual development workflow?\n\n### Natural language as code\n\nThe answer mirrors every programming ecosystem‚Äôs evolution. Just like JavaScript evolved from browser scripts to using `Node.js` runtimes, package managers, and deployment tooling, agent primitives need similar infrastructure to reach their full potential.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just a metaphor: These `.prompt.md` and `.instructions.md` files represent a genuine new form of software development that requires proper tooling infrastructure.\n\n**Here‚Äôs what we mean:** Think of your agent primitives as real pieces of software, just written in natural language instead of code. They have all the same qualities: You can break complex tasks into smaller pieces (modularity), use the same instructions in multiple places (reusability), rely on other tools or files (dependencies), keep improving and updating them (evolution), and share them across teams (distribution).\n\nThat said, your natural language programs are going to need the same infrastructure support as any other software.\n\n### Agent CLI runtimes\n\nMost developers start by creating and running agent primitives directly in VS Code with GitHub Copilot, which is ideal for interactive development, debugging, and refining daily workflows. However, when you want to move beyond the editor‚Äîto automate your workflows, schedule them, or integrate them into larger systems‚Äî[you need agent CLI runtimes like Copilot CLI](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-25-github-copilot-cli-is-now-in-public-preview/?utm_source=blog-source-cli-changelog-oct-2025&amp;utm_campaign=agentic-copilot-cli-launch-2026).\n\nThese runtimes let you execute your agent primitives from the command line and tap into advanced model capabilities. This shift unlocks automation, scaling, and seamless integration into production environments, taking your natural language programs from personal tools to powerful, shareable solutions.\n\n### Runtime management\n\nWhile VS Code and GitHub Copilot handle individual development, some teams may want additional infrastructure for **sharing, versioning, and productizing** their agent primitives. Managing multiple Agent CLI runtimes can become complex quickly, with different installation procedures, configuration requirements, and compatibility matrices.\n\n[APM (Agent Package Manager)](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm) solves this by providing unified runtime management and package distribution. Instead of manually installing and configuring each vendor CLI, APM handles the complexity while preserving your existing VS Code workflow.\n\nHere‚Äôs how runtime management works in practice:\n\n```\n# Install APM once\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmeppiel/apm/main/install.sh | sh\n\n# Optional: setup your GitHub PAT to use GitHub Copilot CLI\nexport GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT=your_token_here\n\n# APM manages runtime installation for you\napm runtime setup copilot # Installs GitHub Copilot CLI apm runtime setup codex # Installs OpenAI Codex CLI\n\n# Install MCP dependencies (like npm install)\napm install\n\n# Compile Agent Primitive files to Agents.md files\napm compile\n\n# Run workflows against your chosen runtime\n# This will trigger 'copilot -p security-review.prompt.md' command\n# Check the example apm.yml file a bit below in this guide\napm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123 ```\n\nAs you can see, your daily development stays exactly the same in VS Code, APM installs and configures runtimes automatically, your workflows run regardless of which runtime is installed, and the same apm run command works consistently across all runtimes.\n\n## Distribution and packaging\n\nAgent primitives‚Äô similarities to traditional software become most apparent when you get to the point of wanting to share them with your team or deploying them into production‚Äîwhen you start to require things like package management, dependency resolution, version control, and distribution mechanisms.\n\nHere‚Äôs the challenge: You‚Äôve built powerful agent primitives in VS Code and your team wants to use them, but distributing Markdown files and ensuring consistent MCP dependencies across different environments becomes unwieldy. You need the equivalent of npm for natural language programs.\n\n[APM](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm) provides this missing layer. It doesn‚Äôt replace your VS Code workflow‚Äîit extends it by creating distributable packages of agent primitives complete with dependencies, configuration, and runtime compatibility that teams can share, just like npm packages.\n\n### [Package management in practice](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/tooling/#package-management-in-practice)\n\n```\n# Initialize new APM project (like npm init)\napm init security-review-workflow\n\n# Develop and test your workflow locally\ncd security-review-workflow apm compile && apm install apm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123\n\n# Package for distribution (future: apm publish)\n# Share apm.yml and Agent Primitive files with team\n# Team members can install and use your primitives\ngit clone your-workflow-repo cd your-workflow-repo && apm compile && apm install apm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=456 ```\n\nThe benefits compound quickly: You can distribute tested workflows as versioned packages with dependencies, automatically resolve and install required MCP servers, track workflow evolution and maintain compatibility across updates, build on (and contribute to) shared libraries from the community, and ensure everyone‚Äôs running the same thing.\n\n### [Project configuration](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/tooling/#project-configuration)\n\nThe following¬† `apm.yml` configuration file serves as the `package.json` equivalent for agent primitives, defining scripts, dependencies, and input parameters:\n\n```\n# apm.yml - Project configuration (like package.json)\nname: security-review-workflow version: 1.2.0 description: Comprehensive security review process with GitHub integration\n\nscripts: copilot-sec-review: \"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\" codex-sec-review: \"codex security-review.prompt.md\" copilot-debug: \"copilot --log-level all --log-dir copilot-logs --allow-all-tools -p security-review.prompt.md\"\n\ndependencies: mcp:\n- ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server\n```\n\nWith this, your agent primitives can now be packaged as distributable software with managed dependencies.\n\n## Production deployment\n\nThe final piece of the tooling ecosystem enables continuous AI: packaged agent primitives can now run automatically in the same CI/CD pipelines you use every day, bringing your carefully developed workflows into your production environment.\n\nUsing [APM GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/apm-agent-package-manager), and building on the `security-review-workflow package` example above, here‚Äôs how the same APM project deploys to production with multi-runtime flexibility:\n\n```\n# .github/workflows/security-review.yml\nname: AI Security Review Pipeline on: pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize]\n\njobs: security-analysis: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: matrix:\n# Maps to apm.yml scripts\nscript: [copilot-sec-review, codex-sec-review, copilot-debug] permissions: models: read pull-requests: write contents: read\n\nsteps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n- name: Run Security Review (${{ matrix.script }})\nuses: danielmeppiel/action-apm-cli@v1 with: script: ${{ matrix.script }} parameters: | { \"pr_id\": \"${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}\" } env: GITHUB_COPILOT_PAT: ${{ secrets.COPILOT_CLI_PAT }} ```\n\n**Key connection**: The matrix.script values (`copilot-sec-review` , `codex-sec-review` , `copilot-debug` ) correspond exactly to the scripts defined in the `apm.yml` configuration above. [APM](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm) automatically installs the MCP dependencies (`ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server` ) and passes the input parameters (`pr_id` ) to your `security-review.prompt.md` workflow.\n\n**Here‚Äôs why this matters:**\n\n- **Automation**: Your AI workflows now run on their own, without anyone needing to manually trigger them.\n- **Reliability**: They run with the same consistency and reproducibility as traditional code deployments.\n- **Flexibility**: You can run different versions or types of analysis (mapped to different scripts) as needed.\n- **Integration**: These workflows become part of your organization‚Äôs standard CI/CD pipelines, just like regular software quality checks.\n\nThis setup ultimately means your agent primitives are no longer just local experiments‚Äîthey are fully automated tools that you can rely on as part of your software delivery process, running in CI/CD whenever needed, with all dependencies and parameters managed for you.\n\n## Ecosystem evolution\n\nThis progression follows the same predictable pattern as every successful programming ecosystem. Understanding this pattern helps you see where AI-native development is heading and how to position your work strategically.\n\nThe evolution happens in four stages:\n\n1. **Raw Code** ‚Üí agent primitives (`.prompt.md`\n, `.instructions.md` files)\n2. **Runtime environments** ‚Üí Agent CLI runtimes\n3. **Package management** ‚Üí [APM](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm) (distribution and orchestration layer)\n4. **Thriving ecosystem** ‚Üí Shared libraries, tools, and community packages\n\nJust as npm enabled JavaScript‚Äôs explosive growth by solving the package distribution problem, [APM](https://github.com/danielmeppiel/apm) enables the agent primitive ecosystem to flourish by providing the missing infrastructure layer that makes sharing and scaling natural language programs practical.\n\nThe transformation is profound: what started as individual Markdown files in your editor becomes a systematic software development practice with proper tooling, distribution, and production deployment capabilities.\n\n## How to get started with building your first agent primitive\n\nNow it‚Äôs time to build your first agent primitives. Here‚Äôs the plan:\n\n1. **Start with instructions:** Write clear instructions that tell the AI exactly what you want it to do and how it should behave.\n2. **Add chat modes:** Set up special rules (chat modes) to create safe boundaries for the AI, making sure it interacts in the way you want and avoids unwanted behavior.\n3. **Build reusable prompts**: Create prompt templates for tasks you do often, so you don‚Äôt have to start from scratch each time. These templates help the AI handle common jobs quickly and consistently.\n4. **Create specification templates:** Make templates that help you plan out what you want your AI to accomplish, then turn those plans into actionable steps the AI can follow.\n\n## Instructions architecture\n\nInstructions form the bedrock of reliable AI behavior: They‚Äôre the rules that guide the agent without cluttering your immediate context. Rather than repeating the same guidance in every conversation, instructions embed your team‚Äôs knowledge directly into the AI‚Äôs reasoning process.\n\nThe key insight is modularity: instead of one massive instruction file that applies everywhere, you can create targeted files that activate only when working with specific technologies or file types. This context engineering approach keeps your AI focused and your guidance relevant.\n\n**‚úÖ Quick actions:**\n\n- Create the general [`copilot-instructions.md`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilot-instructionsmd-file) file in the `.github`\nfolder for the repository with common rules.\n- Create modular [`.instructions.md`\nfiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-instructionsmd-files) in the `.github/instructions/` folder by domain (frontend, backend, testing, docs, specs‚Ä¶).\n- Use [`applyTo: \"**/*.{js,ts...}\"`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_instructions-file-structure) patterns for selective application.\n\n**üîß [Tools and files:](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/getting-started/#-tools--files)**\n\n``` .github/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ copilot-instructions.md # Global repository rules ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ instructions/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend.instructions.md # applyTo: \"**/*.{jsx,tsx,css}\" ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend.instructions.md # applyTo: \"**/*.{py,go,java}\" ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testing.instructions.md # applyTo: \"**/test/**\" ```\n\n**Example**: Markdown prompt engineering in Instructions with `frontend.instructions.md:`\n\n``` --- applyTo: \"**/*.{ts,tsx}\" description: \"TypeScript development guidelines with context engineering\" ---\n# TypeScript Development Guidelines\n## Context Loading\nReview [project conventions](../docs/conventions.md) and [type definitions](../types/index.ts) before starting.\n## Deterministic Requirements\n- Use strict TypeScript configuration\n- Implement error boundaries for React components\n- Apply ESLint TypeScript rules consistently\n## Structured Output\nGenerate code with:\n- [ ] JSDoc comments for all public APIs\n- [ ] Unit tests in `__tests__/` directory\n- [ ] Type exports in appropriate index files\n```\n\n**‚ö†Ô∏è Checkpoint:** Instructions are context-efficient and non-conflicting.\n\n## Chat modes configuration\n\nWith your instruction architecture in place, you still need a way to enforce domain boundaries and prevent AI agents from overstepping their expertise. Chat modes solve this by creating professional boundaries similar to real-world licensing. For example, you‚Äôd want your architect to plan a bridge and not build it themself.\n\n**Here‚Äôs how to set those boundaries:**\n\n- Define domain-specific [custom chat modes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes) with MCP tool boundaries.\n- Encapsulate tech stack knowledge and guidelines per mode.\n- Define the most appropriate [LLM model](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes#_chat-mode-file-example) for your chat mode.\n- Configure secure [MCP tool access](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-modes#_chat-mode-file-example) to prevent cross-domain security breaches.\n\n| üí° **Security through MCP tool boundaries**: Each chat mode receives only the specific MCP tools needed for their domain. Giving each chat mode only the tools it needs keeps your AI workflows safe, organized, and professionally separated‚Äîjust like real-world roles and permissions. | | --- |\n\n**üîß [Tools and files:](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/getting-started/#-tools--files-1)**\n\n``` .github/ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chatmodes/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architect.chatmode.md # Planning specialist - designs, cannot execute ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend-engineer.chatmode.md # UI specialist - builds interfaces, no backend access ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend-engineer.chatmode.md # API specialist - builds services, no UI modification ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ technical-writer.chatmode.md # Documentation specialist - writes docs, cannot run code ```\n\n**Example**: Creating MCP tool boundaries with [`backend-engineer.chatmode.md`](http://backend-engineer.chatmode.md):\n\n``` --- description: 'Backend development specialist with security focus' tools: ['changes', 'codebase', 'editFiles', 'runCommands', 'runTasks', 'search', 'problems', 'testFailure', 'terminalLastCommand'] model: Claude Sonnet 4 --- You are a backend development specialist focused on secure API development, database design, and server-side architecture.

These can be executed locally or delegated to independent agents. Here‚Äôs how to get started:\n\n- Create [`.prompt.md`\nfiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_prompt-files-experimental) for complete development processes.\n- Build in mandatory human reviews.\n- Design workflows for both local execution and independent delegation.\n\n**üîß [Tools and files:](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/getting-started/#-tools--files-2)**\n\n``` .github/prompts/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-review.prompt.md # With validation checkpoints ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-spec.prompt.md # Spec-first methodology ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ async-implementation.prompt.md # GitHub Coding Agent delegation ```\n\n**Example**: Complete agentic workflow with [`feature-spec.prompt.md`](http://feature-spec.prompt.md):\n\n``` --- mode: agent model: gpt-4 tools: ['file-search', 'semantic-search', 'github'] description: 'Feature implementation workflow with validation gates' ---\n# Feature Implementation from Specification\n## Context Loading Phase\n1.

Confirm: Architecture alignment, test strategy, and breaking change impact. ```\n\n**‚ö†Ô∏è Checkpoint:** As you can see, these prompts include explicit validation gates.\n\n## Specification templates\n\nThere‚Äôs often a gap between planning (coming up with what needs to be built) and implementation (actually building it). Without a clear, consistent way to document requirements, things can get lost in translation, leading to mistakes, misunderstandings, or missed steps. This is where specification templates come in. These templates ensure that both people and AI agents can take a concept (like a new feature or API) and reliably implement it.\n\nHere‚Äôs what these templates help you accomplish:\n\n- **Standardize the process:** You create a new specification for each feature, API endpoint, or component.\n- **Provide blueprints for implementation:** These specs include everything a developer (or an AI agent) needs to know to start building: the problem, the approach, required components, validation criteria, and a checklist for handoff.\n- **Make handoff deterministic:** By following a standard, the transition from planning to doing is clear and predictable.\n\n**üîß [Tools and files:](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/getting-started/#-tools--files-3)**\n\n[**Spec-kit**](https://github.com/github/spec-kit?utm_source=blog-spec-kit-first-oct-2025&amp;utm_campaign=blog-spec-kit-repo-oct-2025) **** is a neat tool that fully implements a specification-driven approach to agentic coding. It allows you to easily get started with creating specs (`spec.md` ), an implementation plan (`plan.md` ) and splitting that into actual tasks (`tasks.md` ) ready for developers or coding agents to work on.\n\n**‚ö†Ô∏è** **Ô∏èCheckpoint:** Specifications are split into tasks that are implementation-ready before delegation.\n\n## Ready to go? Here‚Äôs a quickstart checklist\n\nYou now have a complete foundation for systematic AI development. The checklist below walks through the implementation sequence, building toward creating complete agentic workflows.\n\n[**Conceptual foundation**](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/getting-started/#conceptual-foundation)\n\n1. Understand **Markdown prompt engineering** principles (semantic structure, precision, and tools).\n2. Grasp **context engineering** fundamentals (context window optimization and session strategy).\n\n[**Implementation steps**](https://danielmeppiel.github.io/awesome-ai-native/docs/getting-started/#implementation-steps)\n\n1. Create [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilot-instructionsmd-file) with basic project guidelines (context engineering: global rules).\n2. Set up domain-specific [`.instructions.md`\nfiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-instructionsmd-files) with `applyTo` patterns (context engineering: selective loading).\n3. Configure [chat modes](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_custom-chat-modes) for your tech stack domains (context engineering: domain boundaries).\n4. Create your first [`.prompt.md`\nagentic workflow](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_prompt-files-experimental).\n5. Build your first `.spec.md`\ntemplate for feature specifications (you can use [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for this).\n6. Practice a spec-driven approach with session splitting: [plan](https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#4-create-a-technical-implementation-plan) first, split into [tasks](https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#5-break-down-into-tasks), and lastly, [implement](https://github.com/github/spec-kit?tab=readme-ov-file#6-execute-implementation).\n\n## Take this with you\n\nWorking with AI agents shouldn‚Äôt have to be unpredictable. With the right planning and tools, these agents can quickly become a reliable part of your workflow and processes‚Äîboosting not only your own productivity, but your team‚Äôs too.\n\n**Ready for the next phase of multi-agent coordination delegation?** [Try GitHub Copilot CLI to get started &gt;](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/how-to-build-reliable-ai-workflows-with-agentic-primitives-and-context-engineering/?utm_source=blog-release-oct-2025&amp;utm_campaign=agentic-copilot-cli-launch-2025)",
