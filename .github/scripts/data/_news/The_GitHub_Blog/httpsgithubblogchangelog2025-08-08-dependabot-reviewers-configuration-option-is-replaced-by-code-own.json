  "EnhancedContent": "Following our [previous announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-29-dependabot-reviewers-configuration-option-being-replaced-by-code-owners/), the Dependabot reviewers configuration option has been removed.\n\nWe’ve retired this configuration option because the functionality overlaps with [GitHub code owners](https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners). You can use code owners to define individuals or teams responsible for code in a repository.\n\nTo move Dependabot reviewer assignments to code owners, follow the [migration guide and tools in dependabot/codeowner-migration-action](https://github.com/dependabot/codeowner-migration-action). This includes a GitHub Actions workflow, a command-line script, and step-by-step manual instructions.\n\nFor help or questions, see the migration action’s README or open a discussion in our [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions).",
