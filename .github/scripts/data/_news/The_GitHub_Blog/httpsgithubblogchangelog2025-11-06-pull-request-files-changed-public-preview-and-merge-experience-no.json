When you’re ready to commit the batch of suggestions, clicking **Commit suggestions** opens a dialog where you can review the suggestions that will be applied and update the commit message if needed.\n\n## 🚀 Grouping changes with Copilot\n\nCopilot now analyzes and organizes the changes in a pull request into groups. This feature, which is currently available to Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Pro+ users from the new “Files changed” page, is designed to help developers understand and navigate complex pull requests by grouping related changes such as refactors, configuration updates, or test improvements. Learn more about [grouping changes with Copilot](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-grouping-changes-in-a-pull-request-with-copilot-in-public-preview/).\n\nTo free up more space for the file tree, you can now easily collapse this section:\n\nIf you have questions or feedback about this feature, join the [discussion](https://gh.io/change-group-feedback).\n\n## ⛺ Annotations are now collapsible\n\nAnnotations (e.g., errors, warnings, and other messages) reported by CI tools and other apps can now be collapsed to give more room for viewing code:\n\nYou can also minimize both comments and annotations by checking the **Minimize comments** option under the settings gear menu.\n\n## 🔧 Other fixes\n\nSince the last update, we’ve made numerous fixes to improve accessibility and quality-of-life, including fixes for problems with commenting on deleted files and merged pull requests.\n\n## 🚆 Merge experience updates\n\nThe following improvements are not specific to the new “Files changed” page, but improve the overall experience of working with pull requests.\n\n### Convert to draft more discoverable\n\nYou can now convert a pull request to draft right from the merge experience on the “Conversation” page by clicking the **Convert to draft** link. Previously, you could only do this from the “Reviewers” section in the sidebar.\n\n### Optional status checks on merge queue page\n\nIf you are using [merge queue](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue) to merge changes into a busy branch, the queue page now shows optional status checks for pull requests in the queue. While optional checks do not block merging, they can highlight potential problems that may require investigation.\n\n## Feedback\n\nYour feedback is important. You can report problems, ask questions, and view known issues in the [feedback discussion](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback).\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
