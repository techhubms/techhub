It makes it simple to require specific approvals on sensitive branches and critical code paths, all while scaling seamlessly across your enterprise.\n\nThis new rule is designed to augment CODEOWNER files but not replace them. The CODEOWNERS files will continue to be the way to manage ownership, support individuals as reviewers, and request reviews even if not required.\n\nLearn more in [our documentation about rulesets](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).\n\nJoin the discussion and share your feedback within [GitHub Community](https://gh.io/required-reviewer-feedback).",
