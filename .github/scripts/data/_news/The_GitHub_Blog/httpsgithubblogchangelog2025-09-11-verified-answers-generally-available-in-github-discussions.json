  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Discussions now supports verified answers — a new answer state that sits above “Marked as answer” to signal exceptional community contributions. Repository administrators can now verify answers to indicate they’ve been reviewed for accuracy and trustworthiness. This verification badge helps community members quickly identify authoritative solutions while ensuring community-generated content meets responsible AI standards for safer integration with LLMs and GitHub Copilot.\n\n![A 'Marked answered' discussion has been selected and promoted to a blue verified answer in a GitHub discussion about jeopardy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1f8a3af-3bdd-4ca2-abcc-424222ea1cd4)\n\nVerified answers solve a critical trust problem in community-driven knowledge. While any discussion author can mark an answer as accepted, only repository administrators can apply the verified badge. This creates a higher standard of quality assurance. This is especially valuable on [community.github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/), where GitHub users seek reliable answers about product features, troubleshooting, and bug reports.\n\n## Access and requirements\n\nTo verify an answer:\n\n- You must have admin permissions on the repository.\n- The repository must have discussions enabled.\n- An answer must already exist in the discussion thread.\n\nThe verification option appears under the 3-dot menu for managing an existing answer.\n\nLook for the new “Verified answer” badge when reviewing community responses in your repository’s discussions.\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions).",
