  "EnhancedContent": "## Ever wish Copilot understood your project as well as your teammates do? Now it can.\n\nWith GitHub Copilot Spaces, you can bring together the context it needs ‚Äî files, pull requests, issues, and repos ‚Äî so that Copilot‚Äôs responses are always grounded in your project. With spaces, Copilot doesn‚Äôt just generate output. Copilot understands your systems, your standards, and your open tasks.\n\n## üë©‚Äçüíª Turn Copilot into a project expert\n\nSpaces ground Copilot in curated files, docs, pull requests, and issues so that it can generate code, explain system design, and suggest solutions that follow your team‚Äôs standards. You can add custom instructions to make responses even more specific to your workflow.\n\n![A sample list of sources added to a Copilot Space](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e8e157e-f45e-44f9-8d00-3eb8b2c0accf)\n\n## ‚öñÔ∏è Scale expertise across teams\n\nSpaces make knowledge collaborative. You can share a space across your org so that teammates can access the same project context and get unblocked faster. Instead of repeating the same explanations, your space becomes a living knowledge hub for files uploaded to a GitHub repository.\n\n![Share modal with a couple of names listed that allows you to select individual with whom you can share the space](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d6b774-f7a5-47fe-bdee-d14378718d53)\n\n## ‚è≤Ô∏è Always up to date\n\nYour code is already safely stored on GitHub, and adding it to a space is seamless. You just attach it directly from your repository, no copy and paste required. Once attached, files and repositories stay in sync as they evolve, making Copilot an evergreen expert in your project.\n\n![Context menu showing how to add context from a repository](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26f62529-ec73-4adc-ab15-9d78c0c1284b)\n\n## üñ•Ô∏è Spaces in your IDE\n\nThis release to general availability adds the option to access spaces directly in your IDE through the [remote GitHub MCP server](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp/use-the-github-mcp-server),\n\n## üìÇ Examples of how\u2028teams are already using Copilot Spaces\n\n- Generating code that follows security patterns, API standards, and team preferences.\n- Sharing knowledge like SQL/KQL queries, telemetry schemas, or best-practice auth docs.\n- Onboarding new developers by giving them instant access to curated project knowledge.\n- Planning projects and create issues by centralizing PRDs and decisions in one space.\n\n## üí¨ Get started\n\n- Try Copilot Spaces today at [github.com/copilot/spaces](https://github.com/copilot/spaces?utm_source=changelog-source-product&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-spaces-launch-sep-2025).
