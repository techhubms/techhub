When you’re juggling multiple projects or collaborating across teams, keeping track of repositories becomes overwhelming.\n\nThe new repository dashboard preview makes it easy to find and curate a saved view of repositories you have access to, all in one place.\n\n## How it works\n\nLike the [pull request](https://github.com/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/issues/assigned) dashboards, the [repos](https://github.com/repos) dashboard serves as your command center for repository discovery. It combines search capabilities, filtering, saved queries, and a relevance-based sorting algorithm that prioritizes repositories based on your contributions and access.\n\nYou can access the repos dashboard three ways:\n\n- Visit [github.com/repos](https://github.com/repos) directly\n- Click the repositories icon in the top global navigation bar\n- Navigate the left-hand navigation menu and select **Repositories**\n\n## Benefits\n\n![Repository dashboard displaying a list of built-in and saved views](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbe3552e-f8ee-4cf6-ae69-84fb52274c34)\n\n- **Discover repositories in one place:** Find any repository you’ve contributed to or have access to, from personal projects to enterprise codebases.\n- **Start with curated views:** Instantly access the repositories you care about most with the default views: `My contributions`\n, `My repositories` , `My forks` and `Adminable by me` .\n- **Zero in with filtering:** Refine your search using filters like `visibility`\n, `language` , `organization` , and more. Sort by relevance to surface the repositories where you’re most active.\n- **Save custom queries:** Bookmark custom filters and instantly return to the repository views that matter most to your workflow.\n\n![Repository dashboard displaying a saved view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c757d27-2973-4c5b-9417-c29ee86b27f6)\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe relevance filter and `My contributions` view only include activity from the past year. Repositories you contributed to more than a year ago won’t appear in these views, but these repositories can still be found using search and other filters.\n\nRelevance includes weight from comments made on issues, pull requests, and discussions on repositories. It does not depend solely on code contributions. This weighting is an area we are continuing to iterate on, so please share where it doesn’t “feel” right so we can keep improving.\n\nYou can filter by repository custom properties by preceding the property with an organization name and manually typing the property and value. We’re working to add automatic suggestions for properties and values in a future update. Sample query: `org:Byte-Sized-Demo props.production:true`\n\n[Visit the repository dashboard](https://github.com/repos) and join the discussion in [GitHub community](https://gh.io/repos-finder-discussion) to share your feedback.",
