You no longer need to provide GEI with shared access keys to a storage account you own to perform repository migrations. Instead, migrations can now be performed by uploading repository archives directly to github.com or ghe.com.\n\nYou can start a repository migration using GitHub-owned storage using the `gh gei` and `gh bbs2gh` command line extensions by passing in the `--use-github-storage` flag.\n\n![Repository migrations using `gh gei --use-github-storage` in the terminal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5da7b312-2c43-4f1e-a6fe-1a92b3db05de)\n\nTo migrate repositories with GitHub-owned blob storage, you can follow our documentation for [migrating repositories from GitHub Enterprise Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-between-github-products/migrating-repositories-from-github-enterprise-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud) or [migrating repositories from Bitbucket Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud/migrating-repositories-from-bitbucket-server-to-github-enterprise-cloud).
