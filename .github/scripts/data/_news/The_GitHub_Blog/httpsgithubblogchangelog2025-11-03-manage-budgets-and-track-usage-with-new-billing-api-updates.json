  "EnhancedContent": "We’re expanding our billing APIs with new capabilities to help you programmatically manage budgets, track usage, and access cost center data.\n\n### Manage budgets via APIs\n\nYou can now manage the full lifecycle of budgets via API. Previously, budgets could only be managed through the UI. Now, you can programmatically create, update, and delete budgets, as well as adjust the budget amount and alert notifications. There is currently a temporary limit of 50 budgets per account. This API is now available in public preview.\n\nFor more details, refer to [our documentation on REST API endpoints for budgets](https://gh.io/budget-api-docs).\n\n### Track usage with the new Usage summary API\n\nThe new Usage summary API allows you to retrieve usage information for your entire account or filter by specific organizations, repositories, cost centers, products, or SKUs. Usage can be queried by year, month, or day. This API is now available in public preview.\n\nFor more details, refer to [our documentation on the Usage summary REST API endpoint](https://gh.io/usage-summary-api).\n\n### Additional improvements\n\n- **Cost center API improvement**: The [Get all cost centers for an enterprise API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/enterprise-admin/billing?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-all-cost-centers-for-an-enterprise) now includes an optional `state`\nparameter, which allows you to only get active cost centers by adding `?state=active` when calling the endpoint.\n- **Usage report API changes**: We’ve removed the `hour`\nparameter from the existing usage report API and reduced the granularity of the response when using the `day` parameter to provide daily totals instead of hourly breakdowns. For more details, refer to [our documentation on the Get billing usage report for an enterprise REST API endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/enterprise-admin/billing?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-billing-usage-report-for-an-enterprise).\n\n### Who can use these features\n\n- Enterprise owners and billing managers on GitHub Enterprise plans.\n- Organization owners on GitHub Team plans.\n- Individuals on personal plans.\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://gh.io/billing-api-community-feedback).",
