When you create a new repository, you’ll see a streamlined workflow that makes setting up repositories faster and more intuitive.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- When you create a new repository, there’s an updated flow with clearer guidance for required fields.\n- The new experience helps you get set up quickly and confidently.\n- Inputs now respond to organization and enterprise policies for custom properties, making governance-driven rules easier to adopt.\n\n## Additional updates\n\n- You can now add the merge queue bot as a [bypass actor for rulesets](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#granting-bypass-permissions-for-your-branch-or-tag-ruleset) for repository and organization rulesets. Now merge queue branches (e.g., `gh-readonly-queue/**`\n) work as expected while allowing you to blocking updates from other actors.\n- We’ve updated the repository insights [commits page](https://github.com/github/codeql/graphs/commit-activity) to make the commit graph accessible to screen readers. You can also view commit data as a table or download it as a CSV or PNG.\n\n### Feedback\n\nWe want to hear from you!
