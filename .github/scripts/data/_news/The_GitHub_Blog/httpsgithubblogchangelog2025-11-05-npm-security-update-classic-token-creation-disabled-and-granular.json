As [previously announced](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/178140), we’re implementing the first set of changes to npm’s token management system.\n\n## What’s changing today (November 5, 2025)\n\n### Classic tokens\n\n- **New classic tokens can no longer be created** through the website, CLI, or API.\n- Existing classic tokens continue to work until November 19, 2025.\n- The `npm token create`\nCLI command no longer generates classic tokens.\n\n### Granular access tokens\n\n- **New tokens with write permissions now enforce 2FA by default**.\n- A new **Bypass 2FA** option is available for CI/CD workflows (unchecked by default).\n- **All existing granular tokens with write permissions are now capped at 90-day maximum lifetime**.\n- Existing tokens set to expire after February 3, 2026 have been adjusted to expire on that date.\n\n## What you need to do\n\n### If you use classic tokens\n\nYou have until **November 19, 2025** to migrate to granular access tokens. After this date, all classic tokens will be permanently revoked.\n\n#### Migration steps:\n\n1. Visit [npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens).\n2. Click **Generate New Token** → **Granular Access Token**.\n3. Configure appropriate permissions for your use case.\n4. For CI/CD workflows requiring write access, consider enabling **Bypass 2FA** or use established trust publishing with OIDC.\n5. Replace classic tokens in your workflows with the new granular tokens.\n\n**Note:** Granular tokens must currently be created through the website. We’re actively working on adding full CLI support for granular token management via `npm token` commands in the coming weeks.\n\n### If you use granular tokens\n\n- Check your tokens’ expiration dates at [npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/~/tokens).\n- Plan for token rotation if any of them expire on February 3, 2026.\n- New tokens created for CI/CD may need **Bypass 2F** enabled if noninteractive publishing is required.\n\n## Looking ahead: November 19, 2025\n\nOn November 19, we will **permanently revoke all classic tokens** and replace long-lived local publishing tokens with 2-hour session tokens.\n\n## Need help?\n\n- 📚 [Token migration guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens)\n- 💬 [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/178140)\n- 🎫 [npm support](https://www.npmjs.com/support)\n\nWe understand these changes require effort from you. Thank you for partnering with us to make npm more secure for the entire JavaScript ecosystem.",
