[This feature was previously in public preview](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-21-copilot-generated-commit-messages-on-github-com-is-in-public-preview/), and is now generally available to all Copilot users.\n\nWhen this feature is enabled, Copilot automatically suggests a concise summary of changes made through the file editor on github.com. File deletions will continue to use the existing “Delete FILENAME” default, and adding a file without any contents will continue to use the existing “Add FILENAME” default.\n\n![Commit message and description and a label indicating that the message was generated by Copilot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc01cef3-ad97-42d0-909b-ff8820f95593)\n\n## Enabling Copilot-generated commit messages\n\nCopilot-generated commit messages are available to users on all GitHub Copilot plans.\n\nIndividuals can opt out of this feature via the Copilot-generated commit messages toggle in [GitHub Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features). Enterprises (including GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency) and organizations can opt into this feature via their enterprise administrator settings. Enterprises that are opted into public preview features will automatically be opted into Copilot-generated commit messages.\n\nIf your enterprise has rulesets for commit metadata enabled, you will still see a default commit message for commits made in organization-related files.\n\nJoin the discussion within the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/176999).",
