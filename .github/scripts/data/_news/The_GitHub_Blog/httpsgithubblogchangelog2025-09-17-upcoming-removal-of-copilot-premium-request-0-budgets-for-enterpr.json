  "EnhancedContent": "Starting November 18, 2025, GitHub will begin removing all $0 Copilot premium request budgets for enterprise and team accounts created before August 22, 2025. As a result, premium request paid usage will be governed by your account’s premium request paid usage policy, not a static $0 budget.\n\n### Who is affected?\n\nAll enterprise and org accounts with an account-level $0 Copilot premium request budget created before August 22, 2025 are affected.\n\nPro and Pro+ Copilot users are **not** affected and will continue to have $0 budgets by default.\n\n### Why are we making this change?\n\n- **Enables granular controls without complexity:** Starting in October, each AI tool will have their own dedicated SKUs for tracking and managing premium request usage, beginning with coding agent and Spark. Keeping the $0 budget model would require you to manually create and manage separate $0 budgets for each new AI tool, creating unnecessary administrative burden as we expand our AI capabilities.\n- **Simplifies billing:** Removing this budget option eliminates friction and manual intervention for admins, letting you scale AI usage with confidence.\n\n### What do you need to do?\n\nTo control premium request paid usage, review and update your premium request paid usage policy. You can disable paid usage at any time in your Copilot policy settings.\n\nLearn more in [our documentation on premium requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests?versionId=enterprise-cloud@latest&amp;productId=billing).\n\n### Questions\n\nJoin the [community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/173899) or contact your GitHub account team for more information.",
