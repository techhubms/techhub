This change is intended to reduce confusion, improve reliability, and encourage use of the GitHub platform’s built-in tools for working with pull requests.\n\n### Upcoming Dependabot comment command deprecations\n\n- `@dependabot merge`\n- `@dependabot cancel merge`\n- `@dependabot squash and merge`\n- `@dependabot close`\n- `@dependabot reopen`\n\nOver the next month, you will notice Dependabot posts a comment on the pull request when you use these commands, letting you know of the upcoming deprecation. Beginning on November 11th, these comment commands will no longer be supported.\n\n### Migration guidance\n\nPlease update your workflows to rely on GitHub’s native features. For merging, closing, or reopening pull requests, we recommend using GitHub’s built-in UI, the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr), and/or the [REST API endpoints for pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls?apiVersion=2022-11-28).",
