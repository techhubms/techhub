  "EnhancedContent": "Actions Runner Controller (ARC) release [0.13.0](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/releases/tag/gha-runner-scale-set-0.13.0) is now available and provides improvements in storage, networking, platform, and metrics.\n\n### Enable container hooks to remove storage limitations\n\nARC now supports [container lifecycle hooks](https://github.com/actions/runner-container-hooks/releases/tag/v0.8.0) that restore and export job file systems between pods, eliminating the need for ReadWriteMany (RWX) volumes. This improves portability, simplifying operations, and enhancing performance by leveraging local storage. RWX remains supported for scenarios requiring concurrent writes. To use the new container hook with ARC, update the `containerMode` in the `values.yml` file to `kubernetes-novolume` . Refer to [our documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions/tutorials/use-actions-runner-controller/deploy-runner-scale-sets#using-kubernetes-mode) for additional information and examples.\n\n### Networking updates\n\nDual-stack networking (IPv4/IPv6) is now available for runners and controller services, enabling IPv6 on compatible clusters with seamless IPv4 fallback. Update any custom network policies, firewall rules, or ingress allow-lists to include IPv6 ranges to avoid connectivity gaps.\n\n### Platform and security\n\nVault integration for Azure Key Vault is now generally available, enabling secure integration for workflows without exposing secrets in the workflow context (e.g., `${{ secrets }}` ). This feature supports both cloud and on-premises scenarios. For cloud environments, Microsoft recommends using a managed identity for accessing Azure Key Vault, as it eliminates the need to manage secrets or certificates. Alternatively, customers can use the Secrets Store CSI driver for Kubernetes-based deployments.\n\nRed Hat OpenShift support for ARC is also generally available, broadening enterprise platform compatibility. Additionally, the JIT token is no longer stored in the ephemeral runner status field, enhancing security and reducing exposure risk.\n\n### Metrics and observability\n\nARC introduces distinct `workflow_name` and target labels for runners and metrics, enabling clearer filtering, alerting, and dashboards without parsing the composite `job_workflow_ref` . The legacy `job_workflow_ref` label will continue to be emitted in 0.13.0 for backward compatibility but will be removed in v0.14.0, so users should update dashboards, alerts, and automations before upgrading.",
