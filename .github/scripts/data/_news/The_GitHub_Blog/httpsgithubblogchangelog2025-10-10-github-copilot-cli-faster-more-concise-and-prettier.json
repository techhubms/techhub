This week brought another set of [daily improvements](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases) powered by your feedback in our public repo. Thank you for helping us build something great!\n\nHere’s what’s new this week.\n\n## Faster results, fewer tokens\n\nWe’ve made tweaks to our prompts that make Copilot’s responses more concise, relevant, and fast. In testing in Terminal-Bench, we’ve found that these improvements led to a 15% reduction in steps to task completion, a 17% reduction in input tokens, and a 15% reduction in output tokens. The average wall clock time per-task dropped 25%, with the median wall clock time dropping a whopping 45%. Copilot now responds more concisely to simple questions, delivering you answers faster and keeping you focused on the task at hand.\n\n## A more streamlined timeline and input experience\n\nWe’ve built on top of [last week’s updates](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-03-github-copilot-cli-enhanced-model-selection-image-support-and-streamlined-ui/#refined-interface-and-navigation) to our timeline interface and input experience to deliver a number of new improvements.\n\n- When editing files, the diffs are now shown by default without the need to Ctrl+R to expand them.\n- We adjusted markdown colors to be easier to read.\n- We improved rendering in windows less than 80 columns wide.\n\nWhen combined with last week’s changes and the assistant’s more concise output, this delivers a measurably better developer experience.\n\nBased on your feedback, we’ve implemented several quality-of-life improvements to the input experience. More are on the way!\n\n- Slash commands won’t cycle through tab completions if an argument is present.\n- Slash commands will give hints when inputting arguments.\n- Terminals supporting the Kitty protocol can now use Shift+Tab to input multiple lines — broader terminal support is on the way.\n- Ctrl+B and Ctrl+F move the cursor back and forward.\n\n## Windows improvements\n\nWe made a variety of fixes that improved our support in PowerShell on Windows. File write performance is greatly increased, and we fixed several bugs surrounding PowerShell command execution in cases where users had custom profiles and other configurations. Thank you for your reports as we work to bring Windows support to the same level as Linux and MacOS.\n\n## Bugfixes and other improvements\n\n- Proxy support now works on all supported Node versions.\n- Added a prompt for users who launch with `--screen-reader`\nto persistently save this preference.\n- Fixed a bug where pasting content truncated the prompt sent to the model.\n- Fixed a bug where `/clear`\ndid not properly reset the context truncation tracking state.\n\nAnd many more! Keep your eyes peeled on our [daily release notes](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases).\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nUpdate GitHub Copilot CLI by running `npm install -g @github/copilot@latest` in your terminal. Thank you to everyone who has submitted feedback via the `/feedback` command and by opening issues in [our public repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli). Your continued feedback is invaluable as we continue to ship improvements daily.",
