With YAML anchors, you can reuse configuration across your workflows and ensure better conformance with the YAML spec. This feature is automatically enabled for all GitHub Actions users and repositories.\n\nTo learn more about how YAML anchors work and see examples, check out the [documentation for YAML anchors](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/reusing-workflow-configurations#yaml-anchors-and-aliases).\n\n### Use workflow templates from non-public `.github`\nrepositories\n\nGitHub Actions now support workflow templates from a nonpublic GitHub repository. GitHub Actions users can use [workflow templates](https://docs.github.com/actions/concepts/workflows-and-actions/reusing-workflow-configurations#workflow-templates) to speed up their development process in their organization by placing templates in a public repository called `.github` . This repository is also used for other organization templates, like Issue Templates.\n\nGitHub Actions now supports issue templates in nonpublic `.github` repositories. If the `.github` repository is internal, then internal and private repositories can use these workflow templates. If the `.github` repository is private, only private repositories can use these workflow templates. These changes only apply to GitHub Actions — other products that use `.github` repositories (e.g., GitHub Issues) will continue to only use public `.github` repositories.\n\n### Identify running jobs with job check run ID in GitHub Actions contexts\n\nWe’ve added support for the `check_run_id` value in the job context for GitHub Actions workflows. Now you’ll be able to identify the currently running job directly from within that job by accessing `check_run_id` . This update makes it easier to handle reporting, send notifications, and upload artifacts that are tied to specific jobs. You can access it inside the `job` context using `job.check_run_id` , and it’s available to all GitHub Actions users\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
