Your patience and partnership in securing our shared ecosystem is deeply appreciated.\n\n## Whatâ€™s changing\n\n### Granular access token lifetime limits\n\nStarting in mid-October, all newly created write-enabled granular access tokens will have:\n\n- A default expiration of seven days, reduced from 30 days.\n- A maximum expiration of 90 days, which used to be unlimited.\n\n#### Why this matters\n\nLong-lived tokens are a primary vector for supply chain attacks. When tokens are compromised, shorter lifetimes limit the window of exposure and reduce potential damage. This change brings npm in line with security best practices already adopted across the industry.\n\n#### What you need to do\n\n- Review your CI/CD workflows that use granular tokens\n- Plan for more frequent token rotation\n- Consider migrating to [Trusted Publishers (OIDC)](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) for GitHub Actions workflows\n\nExisting granular tokens will continue working with their current expiration dates, giving you time to transition.\n\n### Classic token sunset\n\nOver the next five weeks, we will:\n\n- Revoke all existing legacy classic tokens.\n- Disable legacy classic token generation permanently.\n\n#### Why this matters\n\nClassic tokens lack granular permissions and modern security controls. They grant broad access to your account, making them high-risk if they are compromised.\n\n#### What you need to do\n\nIf you use classic tokens you **must immediately** take the following actions:\n\n- Generate new granular access tokens with appropriate scoped permissions.\n- Update all automation, CI/CD pipelines, and local configurations.\n- Check [npmjs.com documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com) for updated guidance.\n\n### TOTP 2FA configuration changes\n\nNew TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) setups will be permanently disabled. Existing TOTP configurations will continue to work for now, but they will be phased out in the coming months.\n\n#### Why this matters\n\nWeâ€™re strengthening our 2FA implementation to prevent potential bypass vulnerabilities. WebAuthn/passkeys provide stronger, phishing-resistant authentication.\n\n#### What you need to do\n\n- If you already use TOTP, no immediate action is needed, but you should plan to migrate.\n- New 2FA setups should use [WebAuthn/passkeys](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-two-factor-authentication).\n- Consider upgrading existing TOTP to WebAuthn for enhanced security.\n\n## Timeline and implementation\n\nThese changes will roll out progressively:\n\n- **Now**: Warning messages appear in npm CLI and website.\n- **Early October**: New token lifetime limits and TOTP changes take effect.\n- **Mid-November**: Classic tokens revoked and generation disabled.\n\nWeâ€™re deliberately spacing out these changes to give you time to adapt while maintaining momentum on security improvements.\n\n## Looking ahead: Trusted publishers\n\nWhile weâ€™re tightening token security, we recognize that frequent rotation can be challenging for automation workflows. Thatâ€™s why we strongly encourage adoption of [trusted publishing (OIDC)](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers).\n\nTrusted publishing eliminates long-lived tokens entirely by using temporary, job-specific credentials from your CI/CD provider. Currently supporting GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD, weâ€™re actively working to expand support for Azure Pipelines, CircleCI, and other platforms.\n\nThe benefits of trusted publishing include:\n\n- No tokens to rotate or leak\n- Automatic provenance attestation\n- Simplified security model\n- Better audit trails\n\nWe know trusted publishing needs improvements to support all workflows, and weâ€™re committed to expanding capabilities based on your feedback.\n\n## We need your partnership\n\nWe understand these changes require effort from our community. Securing npm is a shared responsibility. These changes may cause temporary friction, but theyâ€™re essential for protecting our ecosystem from increasingly sophisticated attacks. The recent compromises of popular packages underscore the urgency of these improvements.\n\nThings you can do to help:\n\n- Start migrating away from classic tokens today\n- Share feedback in our [Community Discussion thread](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/174507)\n- Update your token rotation practices\n- Help other maintainers in your community understand these changes\n\n## Getting support\n\nWeâ€™re here to help you through this transition:\n\n- ðŸ“š [npm Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com): Updated with the latest guidance\n- ðŸ’¬ [Community Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/174507): Share feedback and get help from the community\n- ðŸ“§ [npm Support](https://www.npmjs.com/support): For additional assistance\n\n## Thank you\n\nYour commitment to security makes npm safer for millions of developers worldwide. Together, weâ€™re building a more resilient foundation for the JavaScript ecosystem.\n\nStay tuned for future updates as we continue rolling out the security improvements outlined in our [security roadmap](https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/our-plan-for-a-more-secure-npm-supply-chain/).\n\n*This is the first in a series of security updates.
