  "EnhancedContent": "GPT-5, OpenAI’s latest frontier model, is rolling out in public preview to users of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse.\n\nGPT-5 is OpenAI’s most advanced model to date, delivering substantial improvements in reasoning, code quality, and user experience over previous versions. It excels at handling end-to-end complex coding tasks, large implementations with minimal prompting, and provides clear, upfront explanations of its actions. GPT-5 also introduces enhanced agentic capabilities, making it a true coding collaborator for developers as well as an intelligent assistant for all users.\n\n## Availability in GitHub Copilot\n\nGPT-5 is rolling out to all paid Copilot plans. You will be able to access the model in GitHub Copilot Chat on github.com, GitHub Mobile, VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse through the chat model picker (`Agent` , `Ask` , and `Edit` modes). If you do not yet have access, please continue to check back.\n\n## Enabling access\n\nCopilot Enterprise and Business administrators must opt in by enabling the new GPT-5 policy in Copilot settings. Once enabled, users in that organization will see **GPT-5** in the model picker.\n\nTo learn more about the models available in Copilot, see [our documentation on models](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-hosting#openai-models) and get started with Copilot today.\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nHave feedback or questions?
