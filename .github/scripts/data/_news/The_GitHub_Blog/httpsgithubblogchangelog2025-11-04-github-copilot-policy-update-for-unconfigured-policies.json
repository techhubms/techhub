Now, if an enterprise policy is set to `Unconfigured` , the corresponding organization policy will default to `Disabled` instead of allowing organizations to set it to `Enabled` .\n\nThis ensures that policies remain restricted unless the enterprise admin explicitly enables or delegates the policy.\n\nTo prevent an undesired disruption in service, formerly affected organization policies which are currently set to `Enabled` are not changed by this update. However, once an admin sets a policy to `Disabled` , it cannot be changed at the organization level again unless the enterprise policy is updated to permit it. Organization policies for future releases will automatically inherit the correct `Disabled` setting when the enterprise policy is `Unconfigured` .\n\n## Learn more\n\nFor more information visit [our documentation about managing Copilot policies](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-enterprise-policies).",
