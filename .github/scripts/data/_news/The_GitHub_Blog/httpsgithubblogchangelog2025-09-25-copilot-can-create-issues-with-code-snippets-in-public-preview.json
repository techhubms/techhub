You can now ask Copilot to include relevant code snippets and files directly into your issues on [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot).\n\nYou can now:\n\n- Create an issue and ask Copilot to attach related code snippets or files.\n- Add snippets after Copilot’s initial draft.\n- Review and edit Copilot’s suggestions before creating the issue.\n\n## Try it out\n\n1. Navigate to [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot).\n2. Try prompts like: “Create me an issue for `YOUR-PROMPT-HERE`\nin `YOUR-ORGANIZATION/YOUR-REPOSITORY` and add relevant code snippets.”\n\n## Helpful tips\n\n- Snippets aren’t added by default, so be sure to prompt Copilot to include them.\n- Copilot may make mistakes, so always double-check the snippets and files it suggests.\n- Be specific with your prompts to get the most useful results.\n\nWith this update, issues can carry richer context from the start, helping you maintain continuity from reporting to implementation.",
