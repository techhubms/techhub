  "EnhancedContent": "The era of AI-powered development is here. Gartner predicts that by 2028, 90% of enterprise software engineers will use AI code assistants, up from less than 14% in early 2024. This surge confirms what developers already know: AI is transforming how software gets built, removing friction, unlocking creativity, and enabling teams to achieve more than ever before. It’s a paradigm shift that’s driving adoption at unprecedented speed.\n\nWith 20M+ users across 77,000 enterprises, GitHub Copilot’s scale sets us apart, helping to shape the rapidly evolving AI Code Assistants market. As adoption accelerates and the landscape expands with new entrants and innovation, we continue to push the boundaries of innovation to increase the happiness and productivity of every developer. This is why we’re proud to announce that, for the second year in a row, Gartner® has positioned GitHub as a Leader for our flagship product GitHub Copilot in the 2025 Magic Quadrant™ for AI Code Assistants.\n\n![Gartner 2025 Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants showing GitHub as highest in ability to execute and the furthest right in completeness of vision. Other Leaders include Amazon, Cognition (Windsurf), GitLab, and Google Cloud.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MQ.png?resize=937%2C1024)\n\nAs part of the report, Gartner evaluated 14 vendors based on their ability to execute and completeness of vision. GitHub placed as the highest in ability to execute and the furthest right in completeness of vision.\n\nAccording to Gartner, “Leaders in this Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants continue to set the benchmark for end-to-end developer enablement through advanced AI capabilities. They consistently integrate cutting-edge models into robust, agentic workflows that enhance productivity, code quality, and security across the SDLC. These vendors exhibit a sharp understanding of enterprise needs, translating customer feedback into iterative improvements and differentiated innovation — such as long-context reasoning, hybrid deployment flexibility, and seamless integration across IDEs and DevSecOps platforms. Leaders also stand out through their operational maturity, supporting global enterprises with scalable infrastructure, regulatory compliance, and strong service-level reliability. Their growing ecosystems, deepening product integration, and strategic clarity ensure sustained influence across diverse developer and enterprise environments.”\n\nWe view this recognition as a reflection of our commitment to empowering every developer and staying true to our north star: building an open, secure, and AI-powered platform that defines the future of software development.\n\n## Trusted innovations\n\nWe believe that our Leader placement in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Code Assistants is a reflection of our progress at that moment in time. We’ve since kept our foot on the gas, shipping innovations that continue to reshape how developers and organizations build with AI, including:\n\n- GitHub Copilot Coding Agent: An asynchronous teammate that lives in the cloud, takes on issues, and sends you fully tested pull requests while you focus on higher value work.\n- Copilot agent mode: A real‑time collaborator that sits in your editor, works with you, and edits files based on your needs.\n- Copilot Application Modernization: Helps developers and teams automatically update and refactor legacy codebases to use newer languages, frameworks, or libraries. It handles complex, multi-file changes to modernize applications.\n- GitHub Copilot in VS Code: The core Copilot experience integrated directly into the VS Code editor. It provides real-time code suggestions, autocompletes functions, and helps you write code faster.\n- GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio: The same core Copilot experience, bringing AI-powered code suggestions and real-time assistance directly into the Visual Studio IDE for developers.\n\n## Where we’re headed\n\nOur focus remains on strengthening what makes Copilot the most widely adopted developer tool, whether that means delivering AI-native, enterprise-grade capabilities that embed trust, compliance, and governance at scale; expanding agentic workflows that free developers to focus on higher-value work; or broadening model support and deepening integrations. Each of these investments strengthens the foundation for an AI-powered future where Copilot empowers every developer — from individual contributors to global enterprises — to build with greater speed, creativity, and confidence.\n\nLet’s build.\n\n[Read the full Gartner report](https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2LVTG7RP&amp;ct=250915&amp;st=sb) to discover how vendors were evaluated and why GitHub was recognized as a Leader.\n\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
