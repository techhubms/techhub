  "EnhancedContent": "We’ve added a new `enterprise:` qualifier to GitHub code search, making it easier to search across all organizations in your enterprise.\n\nPreviously, searching across multiple organizations required manually combining many `org:` qualifiers with [boolean operators](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax#using-boolean-operations)—a cumbersome process for enterprises with hundreds or thousands of organizations.\n\n### How it works\n\nAdd the `enterprise:` qualifier to any code search query to search across all organizations in your enterprise. Check out [our docs for an example](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax#enterprise-qualifier).\n\nThe `enterprise:` qualifier works seamlessly with other existing search qualifiers and is subject to the same [limitations as all other qualifiers in GitHub Code Search](https://docs.github.com/search-github/github-code-search/about-github-code-search#limitations).\n\nThis feature is now generally available for all GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers.",
