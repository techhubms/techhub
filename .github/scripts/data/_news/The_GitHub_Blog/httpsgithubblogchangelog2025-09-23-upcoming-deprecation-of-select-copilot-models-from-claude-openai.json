Copilot Enterprise administrators may need to enable access to alternative models through their model policies in Copilot settings. As an administrator, you can verify availability by checking your individual Copilot settings and confirming that the policy is enabled for the specific model. Once enabled, you’ll see the model in the Copilot Chat model selector in VS Code and on github.com. No action is required to remove the models once they have been deprecated.\n\nGitHub Enterprise customers with questions or concerns are encouraged to reach out to their account manager for further assistance.",
