  "EnhancedContent": "CodeQL is the static analysis engine behind GitHub code scanning, which finds and remediates security issues in your code. We’ve recently released [CodeQL 2.23.2](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.23.2/), which introduces a new Rust security query and various other improvements that enhance the accuracy of your code scanning results.\n\n## Language and framework support\n\n- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: We’ve added improved support for the `graphql`\nlibrary. Data flow from GraphQL query sources and variables to resolver function parameters is now tracked. We’ve also added support for the `aws-sdk` and `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` , `@aws-sdk/client-athena` , `@aws-sdk/client-s3` , and `@aws-sdk/client-rds-data` packages.\n- **Python**: Data flow tracking through global variables now supports nested field access patterns such as `global_var.obj.field`\n. This improves the precision of taint tracking analysis when data flows through complex global variable structures.\n- **Ruby**: We’ve added initial modeling for the Ruby Grape framework to detect API endpoints, parameters, and headers within Grape API classes.\n- **Go**: CodeQL Go analysis now supports the **Git Source** type for private package registries. This adds to the existing support for the **GOPROXY server** type.\n\n## Query changes\n\n**C#**\n\n- We’ve improved the modeling of null guards based on complex pattern expressions, which in turn improves the query `cs/dereferenced-value-may-be-null`\nby removing false positives.\n\n**Python**\n\n- We’ve improved queries that check for unmatchable `$`\nand `^` in regular expressions to correctly account for occurrences inside look-ahead and look-behind assertions, eliminating this source of false positives.\n- We’ve modernized the `py/inheritance/signature-mismatch`\nquery. It produces more precise results and more descriptive alert messages. The `py/inheritance/incorrect-overriding-signature` query has been deprecated and its results have been consolidated into the `py/inheritance/signature-mismatch` query.\n\n**Rust**\n\n- We’ve added a new query, `rust/non-https-url`\n, for detecting the use of non-HTTPS URLs that can be intercepted by third parties.\n\nFor a full list of changes, refer to the complete [changelog for version 2.23.2](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.23.2/). Every new version of CodeQL is automatically deployed to users of GitHub code scanning on github.com. The new functionality in CodeQL 2.23.2 will also be included in a future GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) release. If you use an older version of GHES, you can [manually upgrade your CodeQL version](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.17/admin/managing-code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access).",
