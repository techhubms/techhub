  "EnhancedContent": "If 2025 had a theme, it would be growth. Every second, more than one new developer on average joined GitHub‚Äîover 36 million in the past year. It‚Äôs our fastest absolute growth rate yet and **180 million-plus developers now work and build on GitHub**.\n\nThe release of [GitHub Copilot Free](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=octoverse-copilot-cta&amp;utm_medium=octoverse&amp;utm_campaign=universe25) in late 2024 coincided with a step-change in developer sign-ups, exceeding prior projections. Beyond bringing millions of new developers into the ecosystem, we saw record-level activity across repositories, pull requests, and code pushes. Developers created more than 230 new repositories every minute, merged **43.2** **million** pull requests on average each month (+23% YoY), and pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 (+25.1% YoY)‚Äîincluding a record of nearly 100 million in August alone.\n\nThis surge in activity coincides with a structural milestone: for the first time, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub, reflecting how developers are reshaping their toolkits. This marks the most significant language shift in more than a decade.\n\n![A graphic showing key Octoverse 2025 metrics: 630 million total projects on GitHub, over 180 million developers, 1.12 billion total contributions, 4.3 million AI projects, 43.2 million pull requests merged per month (up 23% year over year), and TypeScript and Python as the top two languages used in 2025.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Octoverse-2025-top-level-metrics.png?resize=1440%2C810)\n\nAnd the growth we see is global: India alone added more than 5 million developers this year (over 14% of all new accounts) and is on track to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 2030.\n\n**This year‚Äôs data highlights three key shifts:**\n\n1. **Generative‚ÄØAI is now standard in development.** More than 1.1 million public repositories now use an LLM SDK with 693,867 of these projects created in just the past 12 months alone (+178% YoY, Aug ‚Äò25 vs. Aug ‚Äò24). Developers also merged a record 518.7M pull requests (+29% YoY). Moreover, AI adoption starts quickly: 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week.\n2. **TypeScript is now the most used language on GitHub**. In August 2025, TypeScript overtook both Python and JavaScript. Its rise illustrates how developers are shifting toward typed languages that make agent-assisted coding more reliable in production. It doesn‚Äôt hurt that nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds with TypeScript by default. Even still, Python remains dominant for AI and data science workloads, while the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem still accounts for more overall activity than Python alone.\n3. **AI is reshaping choices, not just code.** In the past, developer choice meant picking an IDE, language, or framework. In 2025, that‚Äôs changing. We see correlations between the rapid adoption of AI tools and evolving language preferences. This and other shifts suggest AI is influencing not only how fast code is written, but which languages and tools developers use.\n\nAnd one of the biggest things in 2025? **Agents are here.** Early signals in our data are starting to show their impact, but ultimately point to one key thing: we‚Äôre just getting started and we expect far greater activity in the months and years ahead.\n\nLet‚Äôs jump in.\n\n**üí° Oh, and if you‚Äôre a visual learner, we have you covered.üëá**\n\n## The state‚ÄØof‚ÄØGitHub in‚ÄØ2025: A year of record growth\n\n![Three key Octoverse 2025 metrics: on average 1 developer joined GitHub every second (up 23% YoY), about 230 new repositories created per minute (+121 million YoY), and 395 million public and open source repositories overall (+72 million YoY).](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-year-of-record-growth.png?resize=1152%2C288)\n\nIn 2023, GitHub crossed 100 million developers after nearly three years of growth from 50 million to 100 million. But the past year alone has rewritten that curve with our fastest absolute growth yet. Today, more than 180 million developers build on GitHub.\n\n**So, what does ‚Äúmore than one new developer joining GitHub every second on average‚Äù actually mean?**\n\n- **Developers are converging on GitHub.** More than 36 million developers joined GitHub in a single year (23% YoY), confirming GitHub as the primary hub for collaboration.\n- **AI adoption starts immediately.** We see nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=octoverse-copilot-cta&amp;utm_medium=octoverse&amp;utm_campaign=universe25) within their first week, offering evidence that AI is now an expectation among new coders.\n- **The talent boom is geographically diverse.** Every minute, ~25 developers joined from APAC, ~12 from Europe, ~6.5 from Africa and the Middle East, and ~6 from LATAM. India alone added over 5 million developers this year.\n\n### GitHub Copilot steepened growth curves\n\nHistorically, developer sign ups and repository creation followed predictable year-over-year patterns. The launch of [Copilot Free](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=octoverse-copilot-cta&amp;utm_medium=octoverse&amp;utm_campaign=universe25) in December 2024 accelerated those curves globally, giving millions access to AI-powered workflows for the first time. The end result? Our typical models for growth overturned dramatically.\n\n![A line chart showing the number of new developers joining GitHub from 2020 to 2025. The line rises steadily, reaching 36.2 million in 2025, with a sharp increase after the launch of Copilot Free in late 2024. The chart has a dark background with blue data lines and the title &lsquo;The number of new developers on GitHub.&rsquo;](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-number-of-new-developers-on-github.png?resize=1728%2C972) ![A graphic showing that nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot within their first week, displayed in large bold text on a blue background with green and purple gradient ribbons.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-80-percent-of-new-devs-use-copilot-in-week-one.png?resize=1440%2C810)\n\n### Private and public repositories play different but interdependent roles\n\nIn 2025, 81.5% of contributions happened in private repositories, while 63% of all repositories were public. The split highlights GitHub‚Äôs dual role: most day-to-day work takes place in private projects, but depends on libraries, models, and frameworks in public open source.\n\nPrivate repositories also grew faster (+33% YoY) than public repositories (+19% YoY), reflecting the growth in organizational development happening on GitHub. We also sometimes see open source software (OSS) work start in private projects.\n\n| **2025‚ÄëYTD lens** | **Contributions** | **Share of total** | **What it signals** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Private repositories** | **4.97B** | **‚âà‚ÄØ81.5%** | Enterprise and team‚Äëlevel collaboration is happening on GitHub. | | **Public repositories** | **1.12B** | **‚âà‚ÄØ18.5%** | The *volume* of work is smaller, yet these projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power the broader ecosystem. |\n\n### Key numbers\n\n- **180M+ developers** are now on GitHub\n- **630M** total repositories with **+121M** new repositories in 2025 marking our biggest year yet\n- **+58M** private repositories (up ‚ÄØ33%) underscore the activity happening outside of the public eye.\n- **Open source and public projects represent the majority of repositories on GitHub.** 63% of all repositories are open source or public.\n\n## Developer productivity: shipping more, waiting less\n\n![A graphic highlighting developer productivity metrics from Octoverse 2025: 5.5 million issues closed in public and private projects in July 2025, 43.2 million pull requests merged per month in 2025, and a 75% year-over-year increase in Jupyter Notebooks as of March 2025. The data is displayed in three panels on a light blue background with abstract gradient shapes.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-developer-productivity-top-line-metrics.png?resize=1728%2C432)\n\n2025 marked the most active 12-month period in GitHub history with more than 1.12B contributions to public and open source projects. Following [the SPACE framework](https://github.blog/enterprise-software/devops/measuring-enterprise-developer-productivity/) (a model that looks at developer Satisfaction, Performance, Activity, Communication, and Efficiency), this increase reflects record levels of developer activity. As developers are increasingly working with LLMs and agents, there are some new, notable correlations in this year‚Äôs data.\n\n### Developer activity reached record levels in 2025\n\nAcross every productivity signal on GitHub, developers set new records in 2025.\n\n| **Activity** | **2024 monthly average** | **2025 monthly average** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Issues closed** | ‚âà‚ÄØ3.4M | **4.25M** | | **Pull requests merged** | 35M | **43.2M** | | **Code pushes** | 65M | **82.19M** |\n\nMomentum accelerated in early 2025 and coincided with the [preview of Copilot coding agent in March](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/) and [the introduction of Copilot code review in April](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-04-copilot-code-review-now-generally-available/). In March, developers closed 1.4 million more issues than the prior month, then continued breaking records, culminating in 5.5 million issues closed in July.\n\nCode pushes are driving the surge with more than 986M commits in 2025 (+25% YoY) and monthly pushes topping 90M by May. Other activity followed:\n\n- **Pull requests created:** +20.4% (47.5M vs 39.5M)\n- **Issues created:** +11.3% (17.5M vs 15.7M)\n- **Comments on issues/PRs:** essentially flat (+0.35%)\n- **Comments on commits:** down -27% (sharp decline)\n\nThese are **observational signals rather than causal claims** and more work is needed to understand the full impact AI is having in software development.\n\n![A line chart showing total open source contributions on GitHub by type from 2022 to 2025. Total contributions increased steadily to about 98.6 million by 2025, with smaller lines representing specific contribution types such as commits, issues, pull requests, and reviews.

In 2025, **2.4 million repositories used Notebooks (+75% YoY)** and **1.9 million used Dockerfiles (+120% YoY).** This growth is likely fueled by the need to sandbox agents and LLMs, and containerization is a practical method to run and scale them securely.\n\n| | **Repositories in‚ÄØ2024** | **Repositories in‚ÄØ2025** | **Delta** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Jupyter Notebook present** | 1.4M | **2.42M** | +75% | | **Dockerfile present** | 875k | **1.9M** | +120% |\n\n### AI agents enter the mainstream\n\n- **AI code‚ÄØreview** **helps developers.** We [conducted in-depth interviews with developers about their code review process](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/code-review-in-the-age-of-ai-why-developers-will-always-own-the-merge-button/) and found that 72.6% of developers who use Copilot code review said it improved their effectiveness**.**\n- **Developers are using AI and agentic tools to build and share their work faster.** Between the total number of developers on GitHub growing in tandem with the release of popular agentic tools and the overall activity increases in languages such as TypeScript and Python, 2025 data shows an increase in rapid prototyping and experimentation.\n\n## Where the world codes‚ÄØin‚ÄØ2025\n\n![A graphic showing key 2025 developer population metrics by country: 21.9 million developers in India (up from 4.5 million in 2020, now ranked #2 globally), 6.89 million developers in Brazil (now #4 globally), and 4.37 million developers in Indonesia (up from 0.9 million in 2020).

That makes India the single largest source of new developers on GitHub this year, continuing its rapid rise since 2020.\n\n![A chart ranking the top 10 countries by developer population on GitHub from 2020 to 2025. The United States remains #1 with 10.2 million to 28 million developers, followed by India rising to #2 with 4.5 million to 21.9 million.

The United States will be the second-largest community with more than 40 million developers expected, while Brazil (19.6M), Japan (11.7M), and the United Kingdom (11M) round out the top five.\n\n**Notably, emerging regions across Africa and the Middle East show momentum with Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Morocco all projected to add millions of developers in the coming years**. This points to a developer population that is not only growing but diversifying geographically at unprecedented speed.\n\n### Key takeaways\n\n- **One in every three** new developers who joined GitHub this year comes from a country that wasn‚Äôt in the global top 10 in 2020.\n- **India alone** added the most developers this year of any country, outpacing the US in growth**.**\n- **The AI boom is global**:‚ÄØThe number of contributors to generative AI projects on GitHub continues to grow fast, and those contributors are working around the world.\n\n## Open source in 2025: activity and influence in the AI era\n\n![A graphic showing key 2025 open source metrics: 1.128 billion contributions to public and open source repositories (up 13% year over year), 60% of the top 10 projects by contributors are AI focused, and 255,000 new open source contributors in March 2025&mdash;the largest month on record.

But we‚Äôre also seeing other project types capture mindshare among developers who are new to open source.\n\n- **Most of the most popular projects sit firmly in AI infrastructure.** Repositories like ollama/ollama, comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, and ultralytics/ultralytics appear prominently, confirming that newcomers want to experiment with models, create local runners, or build pipelines.\n- **Major platforms bring visibility.** microsoft/vscode shows up as one of the top destinations for first-time contributors, underscoring the pull of widely used developer tools and the scale of contribution opportunities within them.\n- **firstcontributions/first-contributions exist almost entirely to help people submit their first pull request**. Their year-over-year presence says first-timers still need and seek low-friction practice sandboxes.\n- **Smart-home, mobile, and game-dev ecosystems attract newcomers.** Smart-home (home-assistant/core), mobile (flutter/flutter, expo/expo), game-dev (godotengine/godot), and 3D printing (bambulab/BambuStudio) rank closely behind the learning repositories. These ecosystems offer visible results on day one, which is perfect for those who want to ‚Äúlearn by doing.‚Äù\n\n**Frontend and dev tool projects also light up.** shadcn/ui and uBlockOrigin/uAssets show that CSS, UI, and browser tooling remain magnets for fresh contributors.\n\n### The global landscape in open source activity\n\n![A chart showing the top 10 countries on GitHub in 2025 by contributors and by total contributions to public repositories.

This suggests higher per-developer activity.\n- **Brazil, Indonesia, and Germany round out the next tier.** Brazil contributes both strong headcount and volume, while Indonesia enters the top 5 for contributors, showing how emerging regions are shaping OSS.\n\n### Community health: Governance isn‚Äôt keeping pace with developer activity\n\n‚Äã‚ÄãGovernance is not keeping pace with velocity. This gap presents an opportunity for developers, organizations, and companies to contribute documentation as well as code.\n\n- **README reach:** ~63% of public repositories include a README, holding steady year over year.\n- **Contributor guides:** At **5.5%**, contributor guides remain an ecosystem-wide opportunity as the number of first-time contributors increases.\n- **Codes of Conduct:** 2% penetration; governance still lags growth.\n\nKey repository files like README or a LICENSE file are more than formalities. They‚Äôre foundational to scaling inclusive, legal, secure, and sustainable collaboration.

Displayed in three light blue panels with abstract gradient design elements.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-security-top-metrics.png?resize=1728%2C432)\n\nAverage fix times for critical severity vulnerabilities have improved by 30% over the past year, as remediation is beginning to keep pace with faster software development.\n\n**Automation is driving this acceleration**. Dependabot usage more than doubled (846k projects, +137% YoY), and AI tools like Copilot Autofix are resolving [common OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) issues across thousands of repositories every month. This is underscored by the fact that in 2025, 26% fewer repositories received critical alerts through a combination of increased automation and AI usage.\n\nAt the same time, new risks are emerging. Broken Access Control overtook Injection as the most common CodeQL alert, flagged in **151k+ repositories (+172% YoY).** Much of this stems from misconfigured permissions in CI/CD pipelines and AI-generated scaffolds that skip critical auth checks (GitHub‚Äôs engineers [published a walkthrough of how they improved their SAML authentication flow](https://github.blog/security/web-application-security/inside-github-how-we-hardened-our-saml-implementation/), which offers some valuable lessons).\n\n### Automation is working (until the merge queue stalls)\n\n**Developers are automating more build, test, and security activity.** In 2025, we saw developers use 11.5 billion total GitHub Actions minutes (measured in CPU minutes) in public projects for free. That‚Äôs up 35% year over year from 8.5 billion GitHub Actions in 2024. Note: in last year‚Äôs report, we included GitHub Actions minutes across public projects and self-hosted usage. If we use the same rubric this year, 13.5 billion minutes were used, which is up 30% from last year.\n\n**Automation raises fixes quickly, but merges still stall when approval depends on humans or policy.** Projects that configure Dependabot with auto-merge rules remediate vulnerabilities more consistently than those relying solely on manual review.\n\n![A graphic showing Dependabot activity on GitHub from 2023 to 2025. Dependabot pull requests opened peaked at 57.74 million in 2023, then were 39.91 million in 2024 and 40.15 million in 2025. Dependabot pull requests merged rose from 12.15 million in 2023 to a high of 15.39 million in 2024, then slightly decreased to 14.17 million in 2025. Displayed on a blue gradient background with abstract geometric icons.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-dependabot-metrics.png?resize=1440%2C810)\n- **We saw a peak of more than 12M Dependabot alerts in December 2022**, which came a year after the Log4Shell vulnerability and immediately after key vulnerabilities in OpenSSL.\n- Monthly openings have since settled near the 3-4M range, but merges hover around 1M. **Only ~1‚ÄØin‚ÄØ3 fixes ships** within the same month it‚Äôs proposed.\n- **Security alerts follow the same pattern**: brief spikes when new CVEs land, then a long tail of unresolved notifications (a number of which are likely attributable to zombie projects that are no longer maintained).\n\n### Faster fix times\n\nIn 2025, we saw 30% faster fixes of critical severity vulnerabilities with 26% fewer repositories receiving critical alerts. And this acceleration is happening at scale with the average fix time shrinking from 37 to 26 days in total.\n\n### Configuring and codifying security\n\nRepositories that define Dependabot behavior in `dependabot.yml` more than doubled this year (**846k, +137% YoY**), marking a shift from ‚Äúnotify me‚Äù to **‚Äúpatch me automatically, within guardrails.‚Äù**\n\n| **Signal** | **2024 (cumulative)** | **2025‚ÄØ (cumulative)** | **YoY** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Repositories with **`dependabot.yml`** | 356k | **846k** | +137% |\n\n### CodeQL in 2025: Broken access control vulnerabilities spike\n\n![A line chart showing the most common types of vulnerabilities detected by GitHub CodeQL from 2022 to 2025. Broken Access Control leads with a sharp rise in 2025, followed by increases in Insecure Design, Security Misconfiguration, and Software and Data Integrity Failures. The chart tracks the number of distinct repositories alerted for each vulnerability type, with Broken Access Control surpassing 30,000 by 2025.

New CodeQL coverage for GitHub Actions revealed widespread misconfigured permissions and token scopes.\n\nThis points to a broader issue: **authentication and authorization remain difficult for both developers and LLMs.** Injection still dominates JavaScript, but Broken Access Control now leads in Python, Go, Java, and C++ (languages where AI-assisted ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù sometimes scaffolds endpoints that look correct but lack critical auth checks).\n\n![A line chart showing the most common types of vulnerabilities detected by GitHub CodeQL from 2022 to 2025.

Autofix also gained traction for Injection (3,100 projects), Insecure Design (2,300 projects), and Logging/Monitoring failures (3,500 projects).\n\n**OpenSSF Scorecard status**: 47 of the top 50 open source projects (94%) defined by their Mona ranking (combined ranking of stars, forks, and issue authors) now use the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) via GitHub Actions or are independently scanned, bringing real-time checks for security best practices.\n\n## The top programming languages of 2025: TypeScript jumps to #1 while Python takes #2\n\n![A graphic highlighting the top programming language trends on GitHub in 2025. TypeScript gained over 1 million contributors (+66% year over year), overtaking Python and JavaScript. Python added 850,000 contributors (+48% YoY), and JavaScript grew by 427,000 contributors (+24.79% YoY). Displayed in three light blue panels with abstract gradient shapes.&rdquo;](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-top-programming-languages-metrics.png?resize=1728%2C432)\n\n**By GitHub contributor counts, August 2025 marks the first time TypeScript emerged as the most used language on GitHub, surpassing Python by ~42k contributors** (other industry indices use different methodologies and may still rank JavaScript and Python higher). This caps a decade-long trend of developers shifting toward typed JavaScript and signals a new default for modern development.\n\n- **TypeScript** grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025 (+66% YoY), driven by frameworks that scaffold projects in TypeScript by default and by AI-assisted development that benefits from stricter type systems.\n- **Python** remains dominant in AI and data science with 2.6 million contributors (+48% YoY). Jupyter Notebook remains the go-to exploratory environment for AI (‚âà403k repositories; **+17.8% YoY** inside AI-tagged projects).\n- **JavaScript** is still massive (2.15M contributors), but its growth slowed as developers shifted toward TypeScript.\n\nTogether, TypeScript and Python now account for more than 5.2 million contributors (roughly 3% of all active GitHub developers in August 2025). The rise of typed languages suggests AI isn‚Äôt just changing the speed of coding, but also influencing which languages teams trust to take AI-generated code into production.\n\n### What changed in 2025\n\n| **Rank 2025** | **Language** | **YoY contributor gain** | **YoY % growth (Aug 2024 vs. Aug 2025)** | **Big takeaway** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **1** | **TypeScript** | **~1,054,015** | **66.63%** | TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript for #1 growth, showing its dominance in new green-field development. | | **2** | **Python** | **~850,579** | **48.78%** | Considered the lingua franca of AI and ML, Python‚Äôs usage has increased significantly amidst generative AI work. | | **3** | **JavaScript** | **~427,148** | **24.79%** | Still massive in scale, but more incremental growth as usage shifts toward TypeScript. | | **4** | **Java** | **~174,705** | **20.73%** | Java continues its steady enterprise-driven growth. | | **5** | **C#** | **~136,735** | **22.22%** | Cloud, desktop, and game dev keep momentum for C#. |\n\n![A chart showing the top 10 programming languages on GitHub from 2023 to 2025. TypeScript rises to #1 in 2025, overtaking Python and JavaScript, which move to #2 and #3 respectively. Other top languages include Java, C#, PHP, Shell, C++, HCL, and Go.

JavaScript and TypeScript lead with over 4.5 million users by 2025, followed by Python with about 3 million, and smaller but steady usage for Java and C#. The chart has a dark background with colored lines and the title &lsquo;JavaScript &amp; TypeScript have the largest combined usage.&rsquo;](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-js-ts-combined-usage.png?resize=1728%2C972)\n\n#### What else we‚Äôre seeing\n\n- **Python dominates AI projects.** It remains the clear leader inside AI-tagged repositories, where Jupyter Notebook usage nearly doubled in 2025 offering evidence of its role as the go-to language for prototyping, training, and orchestrating AI workloads.\n- **Typed &gt; loosely typed.** TypeScript‚Äôs growth confirms our 2024 observation: much of what was previously counted as ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù activity already came through TypeScript transpilation pipelines. The data shows typed languages are increasingly becoming the default.\n- **Enterprise stacks endure.** Java and C# each added over 100k contributors this year, showing steady growth across large enterprise and game-dev environments even as AI reshapes the landscape.\n- **Legacy experiments emerge.** COBOL appeared in our dataset with nearly 3,000 active developers‚Äîlikely driven by organizations and hobbyists creating AI-assisted tutorial repositories aimed at modernizing legacy codebases.\n\n### The fastest-growing languages by percentage growth\n\nThe following languages may not have the biggest developer communities behind them, but each has at least 1,000 monthly contributors and they‚Äôre posting the fastest year-over-year growth rates on GitHub.\n\n| **Language** | **Current developer count** | **YoY %** | **Why it‚Äôs hot** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Luau** | &gt;3,600 | &gt;194% | Luau is Roblox‚Äôs scripting language and a *gradually typed* language, reflecting a broader industry trend toward typed flexibility. | | **Typst** | &gt;3,600 | &gt;108% | As a **modern LaTeX alternative**, Typst aims to make academic and technical publishing faster, less cryptic, and more collaborative. | | **Astro** | &gt;45,600 | &gt;78% | Astro‚Äôs ‚Äúislands architecture‚Äù and focus on shipping zero-JavaScript by default resonate with developers building fast, content-heavy sites (we [added Astro to Linguist in 2021](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/issues/5459), which is our source for languages). | | **Blade** | &gt;91,100 | &gt;67% | As **Laravel‚Äôs templating engine**, Blade rides on Laravel‚Äôs continued dominance in PHP web development. | | **TypeScript** | &gt;2,600,000 | &gt;67% | **Offering type safety for the JavaScript world**, TypeScript‚Äôs combination of JavaScript ubiquity and type safety is compelling for both greenfield and legacy projects (plus, its types work well with AI coding tools). |\n\n### Core stacks for new projects built in the last 12 months\n\nNearly 80% of new repositories used just six languages: **Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, and C#.** These core languages anchor most modern development.\n\n| **Language** | **Total repositories (Sep 2024-Aug 2025)** | **Growth (Jan-Aug 2025 vs. Jan-Aug 2024)** | **What this growth tells us** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Python** | 9,261,587 | **53.41%** | AI‚Äôs default glue with growth driven by ML, agents, notebooks, and orchestration. | | **JavaScript** | 9,345,046 | **14.57%** | Still ubiquitous for scripts and web apps, though growth is slower as TypeScript gains share. | | **TypeScript** | 5,394,256 | **78.10%** | Typed standard for modern web dev. Ideal for safe API/SDK integration, especially with AI. | | **Java** | 3,520,215 | **9.35%** | Reliable enterprise and backend workhorse.

This suggests AI features are being integrated into existing .NET workflows rather than driving a wholesale language shift.\n\n### The languages powering AI development\n\n![A chart listing the most commonly used programming languages in AI-tagged projects on GitHub in 2025. Python ranks first with 582,000 repositories (+50.7% year over year), followed by JavaScript with 88,000 (+24.8%), TypeScript with 86,000 (+77.9%), Shell with 9,000 (+324%), and C++ with 7,800 (+11%).

In 2025, it became part of the everyday workflow. And no matter what tool developers used over the last 12 months, their work converged on GitHub.\n\n- **AI-related repositories on GitHub now exceed 4.3 million,** nearly doubling in less than two years.\n- **Roughly 80% of new GitHub users tried Copilot within their first week,** showing that AI is no longer an advanced tool to grow into, but part of the default developer experience.\n\n![A chart titled &lsquo;Growth in contributors to generative AI projects,&rsquo; showing a sharp rise in distinct contributors from January 2024 through mid-2025.

From September 2024 through August 2025, months averaged ~151k contributors (median ~160k). Activity rose from ~86k in January 2025 to a peak of 206,830 in May (+132% YoY vs. May 2024). It then held near ~200k through the summer. On a like-for-like basis, Jan‚ÄìAug 2025 averaged ~175k contributors, up +108% YoY vs. Jan‚ÄìAug 2024 (~84k), indicating a durable step-change rather than a one-off spike.\n\n**Key takeaways:**\n\n- **Generative AI is becoming infrastructure.** More than 1.1M public repositories now import an LLM SDK (+178% YoY, August ‚Äò25 vs. August ‚Äò24), supported by 1.05M+ contributors and 1.75M monthly commits (+4.8X since 2023).\n- **Growth surged early in the calendar year, then normalized as projects shifted from experimentation to shipping.** Contributors ran +100-118% YoY from Feb-May 2025, then cooled to +31% (Jun), +11% (Jul), and -3% (Aug) as teams focused on shipping vs. experimenting.\n- **AI in open source.** Half (50%) of open source projects have at least one maintainer using [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=octoverse-copilot-cta&amp;utm_medium=octoverse&amp;utm_campaign=universe25).\n- **Early evidence of a prototype-to-production pivot.** Python-based code accelerated mid-2025 while Notebook growth flattened‚Äîsignaling packaging into production.

In other words, teams aren‚Äôt only assigning coding agent to throwaway projects; they‚Äôre trying it in better-known, more established projects as well.\n\nWe invite the community to run **within-repository experiments** (A/B or stepped-wedge) and **matched analyses** conditioned on size, stars, age, and complexity proxies to establish robust baselines. We‚Äôll continue looking into this as we evolve coding agent across GitHub, the Copilot CLI, and more.\n\n### AI is driving notable breakouts in open source\n\n**Generative AI projects continue to be among GitHub‚Äôs most popular.** Projects like vllm, ragflow, and ollama outpaced the historical contributor growth of staples such as vscode, home-assistant, flutter.\n\n| **Repository (age ‚â§3 yrs unless noted)** | **AI connection** | | --- | --- | | **vllm-project/vllm** | Open source *vision-language* model + training/inference stack | | **ggml-org/llama.cpp** | Local Llama inference on CPU/GPU | | **infiniflow/ragflow** | End-to-end retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) template | | **cline/cline** | ‚ÄúLLM-native‚Äù command-line shell that reasons over local context | | **huggingface/transformers** (6.6 yrs) | Defacto Python library for model loading/fine tuning |\n\n### What this tells us\n\n1. **Software infrastructure outpaces everything else in velocity.** Brand-new generative AI repositories (‚â§ 1 yr old) are racking up star counts that took other projects a decade to accumulate.\n2. **Standards are emerging in real time.** The rapid rise of **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) shows the community coalescing around interoperability standards.\n3. **AI is reshaping classic tooling.** Projects like **ollama** **** and **** **ragflow** show how local inference and AI-augmented pipelines are moving from proof-of-concept into mainstream developer workflows.\n\n### AI is helping developers fix code, too\n\nGitHub Copilot Autofix contributed to measurable improvements in 2025:\n\n- **Broken access control** surged the fastest, with fixes accepted in **6,000+ repositories per month** by mid-2025.\n- **Security logging and monitoring failures, injection, insecure design, and misconfiguration** fixes also climbed sharply, each crossing into the thousands of repositories monthly.\n- Autofix is addressing the most common OWASP Top 10 issues‚Äînot just exotic vulnerabilities‚Äîbringing AI into the daily fabric of software security.\n\n### Here‚Äôs how to stay ahead\n\nEarly adopters using agents, open standards, and self-hosted inference are already setting the norms for the next decade. Continuous AI‚Äîsystems and workflows that are updated, retrained, and deployed on an ongoing basis‚Äîis emerging.\n\n- **Expect AI libraries to become ‚Äúplumbing.‚Äù** If your stack can‚Äôt load a model or pipe context into one, you‚Äôll feel legacy-bound quickly.\n- **Go beyond notebooks***.* Package your experiments early to share them with others.\n- **Watch the toolchain, not just the models.** The next productivity leap may come from LLM-native editors, shells, and test runners growing out of today‚Äôs fast-rising repositories.\n- **Build for interoperability.** Standards like MCP and Llama-derived protocols are gaining momentum across ecosystems.\n\n## Take this with you\n\nThree years ago, we said AI wouldn‚Äôt replace developers‚Äîit would bring more people into the ecosystem. The data now proves it: activity on GitHub has reached record levels, with more contributors, more repositories, and more experimentation than ever.\n\n**The past year marked historic milestones**:\n\n- **India overtook the United States as the largest contributor base to public and open source projects on GitHub.** It‚Äôs also poised to overtake the US developer population within the next few years, underscoring how global the developer community has become.\n- **TypeScript became the most used language for the first time**, overtaking both Python and JavaScript and signaling a generational shift in how modern software is built.\n- **Open source remains the foundation**. Public projects supply the libraries, models, and workflows that power most private development. The strength of this ecosystem and the maintainers who sustain it will determine how far and how fast the next wave of software innovation goes.\n\nThe story of 2025 isn‚Äôt AI versus developers. It‚Äôs about the evolution of developers in the AI era where they orchestrate agents, shape languages, and drive ecosystems. No matter which agent, IDE, or framework they choose, GitHub is where it all converges.\n\n## Glossary\n\n- **2025**: Refers to September 1, 2024 through August 31, 2025.\n- **Year-over-year language comparisons:** Unless otherwise noted, YoY values reflect same-month comparisons (e.g., Aug 2025 vs Aug 2024) to normalize for month-length and seasonality in developer activity.\n- **Contributions:** Commenting on a commit, issue, pull request, pull request diff, or team discussion; creating a gist, issue, pull request, or team discussion; pushing commits to a project; and reviewing a pull request.\n- **Contributors**: GitHub users who have performed any of the contribution activities defined above.\n- **Developer:** Anyone with a GitHub account. Also sometimes referred to as a GitHub user. The open source and developer communities are an increasingly diverse and global group of people who tinker with code, make non-code contributions, conduct scientific research, and more. GitHub users drive open source innovation, and they work across industries‚Äîfrom software development to data analysis and design.\n- **Total repositories:** The combined number of public and private repositories on GitHub.\n- **Programming language usage:** Unless otherwise noted, ‚Äúmost used‚Äù languages are ranked by the number of distinct monthly contributors who committed code in that language. This is the standard measure for ‚ÄúTypeScript became the most used language on GitHub.‚Äù\n- **AI-related repository:** Any repository tagged with AI-related topics (e.g., ‚ÄúAI,‚Äù ‚ÄúML,‚Äù ‚ÄúLLM‚Äù) or falling under our AI classification methodology. This broad category captures general experimentation and projects adjacent to AI.\n- **Agentic workflows:** Software development tasks completed with the aid of autonomous or semi-autonomous AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot coding agent creating pull requests, triaging issues, or running tests).\n- **Copilot coding agent**: A GitHub Copilot feature that can independently draft code, run tests, and open draft pull requests in a secure environment‚Äîsubject to developer review and approval.\n- **Copilot code review**: A GitHub Copilot feature that reviews pull requests, suggests changes, and surfaces potential issues before merging.\n- **GitHub Actions minutes**: CPU minutes used to execute GitHub Actions (CI/CD workflows). Reported cumulatively and as YoY growth.\n- **CodeQL**: GitHub‚Äôs semantic code analysis engine used to detect security vulnerabilities. Alerts are categorized by vulnerability type (e.g., Broken Access Control, Injection, Insecure Design).\n- **Mona rank**: Ranks repositories based on their stars, forks, and unique issue authors in the repository. The steps to compute Mona rank: 1) Calculate individual ranks based on stars, forks, and issue authors. 2) Sum these individual ranks. 3) Assign the final ‚ÄúMona Rank‚Äù based on the summed rank.\n- **LLM SDK:** A set of official libraries and tools published by model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, or AI21) that make it easier for developers to connect to and use their large language models. These SDKs wrap the underlying model APIs with client libraries, helper functions, and runtime integrations, letting developers handle prompts, responses, tokens, and extensions without needing to build low-level infrastructure. To determine usage of LLM SDKs, we referenced models offered via GitHub Models. These included SDKs from DeepSeek, Grok, Mistral, Phi, OpenAI, Cohere, Llama, and AI21.\n\n## Methodology\n\n**Scope & coverage**\n\n- **Octoverse year:** **Sep 1, 2024 through Aug 31, 2025**.\n- Unless noted, metrics reflect **public activity** only. Public indicators are also available on the [**GitHub Innovation Graph**](https://innovationgraph.github.com/). For country-level reporting there, we publish metrics only when **‚â•100** unique developers performed the activity in the period.\n\n**Time windows**\n\n- **Monthly snapshots:** Calendar-month metrics to show peaks/turning points (e.g., **Aug 2025** language rankings).\n- **Trailing-12-month (T12):** **Sep ‚Äô24‚ÄìAug ‚Äô25** vs **Sep ‚Äô23‚ÄìAug ‚Äô24** for year-over-year trends/averages.\n- **Longer lookbacks:** Historical context from **Jan 2022 ‚Üí Aug 2025** where relevant.\n\n**Units & entities**\n\n- **Contributors/developers:** **Monthly unique** users per metric (e.g., per language). One user can appear in multiple categories in the same month, so these do not sum across categories.\n- **Repositories:** Counted in a month if created or active, per metric definition.\n- **Activities:** ‚Äúpushes,‚Äù ‚Äúpull requests created/merged,‚Äù ‚Äúcomments,‚Äù etc., follow standard GitHub event definitions.\n\n**Growth baselines**\n\n- **Same-month YoY:** Month vs. the **same month** prior year (e.g., **Aug ‚Äô25 vs Aug ‚Äô24**) are used for milestones/seasonality control as in language comparisons.\n- **T12 YoY:** Trailing-12-month **total or average** vs the prior trailing-12-month metric are used for sustained trends (e.g., average monthly contributors, pull requests per month).\n- **Stock vs. flow (cumulative metrics):** **Stock** = level at a point in time (e.g., SDK repos **as of Aug ‚Äô25**). **Flow** = **adds** over a window (e.g., **Sep ‚Äô24‚ÄìAug ‚Äô25**). Labeled distinctly.\n\n**Geography**\n\n- Developers are mapped to countries via **self-reported locations**, standardized to **ISO country codes**; country aggregates observe the **‚â•100 developers** publication threshold.\n\n**Repository & language classification**\n\n- **Primary language:** GitHub language detection (e.g., Linguist); mixed-language repositories are attributed to **one primary** language.\n- **Notebooks:** ‚ÄúJupyter Notebook‚Äù is a development-environment classification and is labeled transparently.\n- **AI projects:** Identified via signals such as **generative-AI SDK usage** (imports/dependencies) and related metadata.\n- **Open source quality signals:** Presence of files/policies (e.g., codes of conduct) from repository metadata.\n\n**Statistical techniques**\n\n- **Monthly time-series** tracking; **cumulative counts** for stock growth; **Top-N rankings** (contributors, repo counts, growth rates, activity volumes).\n- **Minimum thresholds** to reduce noise (e.g., lists may require **‚â•1,000** contributors or **‚â•X** repos; metric-specific).\n\n**User de-duplication**\n\n- Count **unique users per time period and per metric** to avoid within-slice double counting; cross-category duplication is expected by design.\n\n**Data quality controls**\n\n- **Exclude incomplete months** (e.g., the current month) from YoY/T12.\n- **Filter bots/automation** where identifiable (account flags + behavioral heuristics).\n- Enforce **minimum activity** for inclusion in growth and rankings.\n- **Cross-validate** against multiple internal/public sources (e.g., Innovation Graph).\n\n**Interpretation & reproducibility**\n\n- **Seasonality:** motivates same-month YoY for snapshots and **T12** for structure.\n- **Attribution:** primary language is repository-level; TypeScript/JavaScript mixes may appear under one language.\n- **Scope:** public-only views undercount private activity but preserve directionality.\n- Public counterparts for several metrics can be verified via the **Innovation Graph**.\n\n**Developer growth projections**\n\n- **Forecasting models**: a collection of time-series and regression models that use historical data and statistics to predict future outcomes. Forecasting models relied on historical GitHub data, sign-up rates and product usage, as well as market-sizing information.\n- **Accuracy of forecasts:** No forecast is ever accurate. Backtesting shows models used for forecasting growth projections were within reasonable levels of accuracy (less than 30% Mean Absolute Percentage Error).\n- **External factors:** Forecasts do not take into account competitive landscape changes, geopolitical/economic conditions, or future covariates (product/feature releases that may shift responses differently from historical data).",
