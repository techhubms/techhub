  "EnhancedContent": "With the new [GitHub app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA200009189?tab=Overview) for Microsoft Teams, you can ask [Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent) to generate pull requests, directly from a Teams conversation. Copilot coding agent is our asynchronous, autonomous developer agent.\n\nJust mention `@GitHub` in a conversation with a prompt, and Copilot coding agent will get to work. When the pull request is ready, you can request changes directly from the Teams thread.\n\nIt’s great for offloading tasks such as bug fixes, small features, refactors, logging, and scaffolding — freeing up your time to collaborate and solve complex problems.\n\n### Try it out\n\n1. Make sure Copilot coding agent is enabled for your GitHub account. Copilot coding agent is available with all paid Copilot plans. If you’re a Copilot Business or Enterprise subscriber, an admin must [enable the policy](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/coding-agent-for-business-and-enterprise#copilot-coding-agent-policies-for-copilot-business-and-copilot-enterprise).\n2. Install the [GitHub app](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/836ecc9e-6dca-4696-a2e9-15e252cd3f31) in Microsoft Teams.\n3. Link your GitHub account.\n4. Set your default repository (or specify one when you kick off the task with `repo=owner/repository-name`\n).\n5. Mention `@GitHub`\nin a Teams thread with a prompt like *“Fix this issue with database query timeouts”* to start Copilot coding agent, and follow its progress directly from the thread.\n\nThe previous GitHub for Teams app has been renamed [GitHub Notifications](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/wa200002077?tab=overview), which now focuses on surfacing notifications such as GitHub Issues, pull requests, and GitHub Actions workflows.\n\nThe GitHub app for Microsoft Teams is available in public preview. [Learn more about it](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/integrate-coding-agent-with-teams) and join the discussion within the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations).",
