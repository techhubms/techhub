Delegate a task to Copilot, and it opens a draft pull request, makes changes in the background, then requests a review from you.\n\nThe [GitHub CLI 2.80.0 release](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.80.0) introduces the `agent-task` command set for managing coding agent tasks in `gh` :\n\n- Start a new task: `gh agent-task create \"refactor the codebase\"`\n- List all your tasks: `gh agent-task list`\n- View task details: `gh agent-task view 1234`\n- View the task log in real-time: `gh agent-task view 1234 --log --follow`\n\nThe `agent-task` command set also ships with the following aliases for convenience:\n\n- `gh agent-tasks`\n- `gh agent`\n- `gh agents`\n\nFor more information about command line flags and arguments, run `gh agent-task --help` .",
