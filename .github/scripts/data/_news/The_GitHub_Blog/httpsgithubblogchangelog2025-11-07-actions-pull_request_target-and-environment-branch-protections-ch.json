  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub is updating how GitHub Actions’ `pull_request_target` and environment branch protection rules are evaluated for pull-request-related events.\n\nThese changes will take effect on 12/8/2025. They aim to reduce security critical edge cases in how these events operate on user-controlled branches that may result in unexpected execution of user-supplied workflow code or execution with environment secrets.\n\n### What is changing?\n\nThe `pull_request_target` event now always uses the default branch for workflow source and reference:\n\n- The workflow file and checkout commit will always be taken from the repository’s default branch, regardless of the pull request’s base branch. This prevents outdated—and potentially vulnerable—workflows on other branches within the repository from being executed in these events.\n- `GITHUB_REF`\nfor `pull_request_target` will resolve to the default branch, and `GITHUB_SHA` will point to the latest commit on that branch. This aligns ref semantics with the security model and closes a known class of vulnerabilities where untrusted names or branches could influence evaluation.\n\nPreviously, any branch within the parent repository set as the base branch of a pull request could have been used as the source of the executed workflow (`GITHUB_REF` /`GITHUB_SHA` ) and could result in the execution of outdated workflows. Historically, this behavior has led to the exploitation of outdated workflows that contained vulnerabilities in `pull_request_target` workflows that were presumed to be remediated since they were fixed in the default branch. This change will ensure only the default branch of the repository can be used as the workflow source that is executed for these events, enabling remediation of vulnerabilities in `pull_request_target` workflows in a way that better aligns with developers’ expectations on vulnerability remediation and without the need to update all outdated branches in the repository.\n\nWhile this change helps enable the remediation of vulnerabilities in `pull_request_target` workflows in a repository, it is important to note that the use of `pull_request_target` events in combination with pull requests from forks has an increased risk. `pull_request_target` events execute based on user-supplied pull requests, which can come from external forks, and are executed with access to action secrets. Given this attack surface, care should be taken to avoid [action workflow vulnerabilities](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/) and to ensure untrusted code or input is not being used in a way that could influence execution. GitHub’s code scanning with CodeQL can be used to [identify vulnerabilities in action workflows](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-22-github-actions-workflow-security-analysis-with-codeql-is-now-generally-available/) and is free for all public repositories.\n\nAnother change is that environment branch protection rules for pull request events evaluate against the executing reference:\n\n- To prevent unintended access to environment secrets during pull request workflows, environment branch protection rules will evaluate against the execution reference (`GITHUB_REF`\n), not the pull request head (`HEAD_REF` ).\n- For `pull_request`\n, `pull_request_review` , and `pull_request_review_comment` , environment rules evaluate against `refs/pull//merge` . This matches the merge commit context those events use during execution.\n- For `pull_request_target`\n, environment rules evaluate against the default branch. This is consistent with the updated `GITHUB_REF` and ensures policy checks occur against a trusted ref.\n\n### Breaking changes and impact\n\nWorkflows that rely on environment branch protection rules with pull request triggers may stop matching previous branch patterns because evaluation now occurs on `refs/pull//merge` for `pull_request` family events and on the default branch for `pull_request_target` . Update environment branch filters accordingly.\n\n### What you should do\n\nAssess your usage of `pull_request_target` and use it only when necessary:\n\n- Ensure user-controlled input or code cannot influence execution in a way that runs untrusted code.\n- If your workflow does not require elevated permissions or access to secrets, use `pull_request`\ninstead.\n- Restrict permissions granted to these workflows. Configure the default token [permissions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token.) to read-only or apply least-privilege settings in the workflow.\n- Enable code scanning to have [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) scan your action workflows for common vulnerabilities.\n\nIf your workflows use environments with branch protection rules and are triggered by pull request events:\n\n- Update environment branch filters for `pull_request`\n, add patterns like `refs/pull/*/merge` . For `pull_request_target` , add the repository’s default branch.\n- Consider alternative workflow triggers to continue using your existing branch protection rules or alternative branch protection rules to continue using your existing workflow triggers.\n- As a last resort, disable environment branch protection rules used by pull request jobs, recognizing the trade-off in secret exposure risk.\n\n### How to give feedback\n\nIf you have any feedback or questions, feel free to drop a comment in our [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/179107).",
