This customization helps you to better meet your organization’s security policies and prevent a wider range of secrets from being committed to your repositories.\n\nYou can configure push protected patterns at the Enterprise (**Settings -&gt; Advanced Security -&gt; Additional Settings**) or Organization level (**Settings -&gt; Advanced Security -&gt; Global settings**). The Organization level automatically inherits any settings from the Enterprise level; however, any changes made at the Organization level will take precedence. Pattern configurations are applied globally and cannot be applied to individual repositories or sets of repositories at this time. Push protection configuration for custom patterns has moved to a secondary tab within the **Pattern configuration** pages.\n\n![screenshot of org-level push protection config settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3df5bb65-0709-4d02-bd35-6bc3f9e98d7b)\n\nThe configuration table shows data derived from your Enterprise or Organization on alert volume, false positive resolution rates, and bypass rates. You can use this information to determine whether you should include a pattern in push protection. By default, all patterns are set to their GitHub recommended setting.\n\nYou can also make configuration updates via [the REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/secret-scanning/push-protection?apiVersion=2022-11-28).\n\nLearn more about securing your repositories with [secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning) and [push protection](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-push-protection).",
