This could cause unexpected app installations and governance challenges, particularly for organizations with strict security or compliance requirements.\n\nWith this new setting, organization owners can prevent repository admins from installing GitHub Apps on the repositories they manage. When the setting is enabled, only organization owners will be able to install GitHub Apps on organization repositories. Repository admins must instead request an app installation from an organization owner.\n\n**How this benefits you**\n\n- Strengthen governance for your organization by ensuring only trusted users can install GitHub Apps across repositories.\n- Reduce the risk of unauthorized or unexpected app installations.\n- Help meet compliance requirements.\n\nTo get started, organization owners can navigate to their organization’s **Settings**, click the **Member privileges** tab, and find the new option under **GitHub Apps**.\n\n**How to give feedback**\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, feel free to leave a comment in our [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/178756).",
