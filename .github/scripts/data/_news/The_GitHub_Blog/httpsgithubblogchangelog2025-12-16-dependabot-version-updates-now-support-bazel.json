For projects that use Bazel—either Bzlmod or WORKSPACE—Dependabot version updates can now ensure dependencies stay current with the latest releases.\n\nA huge thanks to the Bazel team for their contributions and collaboration bringing support to Dependabot.\n\n## Background\n\nThe open source community’s [top requests for Bazel support for Dependabot](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/discussions/27142) included:\n\n- Proper lockfile generation\n- `*.MODULE.bazel`\nsupport\n- WORKSPACE support (still widely used despite upcoming deprecation)\n\nBazel uses two dependency systems, both the modern Bzlmod system (`MODULE.bazel` files) and the legacy WORKSPACE system. Community feedback showed many teams still rely on WORKSPACE, so we built support for both. Additionally, Bazel’s `MODULE.bazel.lock` files capture complex transitive dependency graphs, including module extensions and repository rules. Incorrect lockfile generation breaks reproducible builds, so we worked closely with the Bazel community to get this right.\n\n## Community partnership\n\nThe Bazel community provided critical guidance:\n\n- **Fabian Meumertzheim:** Lockfile semantics and behavior matching\n- **Yun Peng:** Testing, validation, and implementation data\n- **Alex Eagle:** File naming conventions and `*.MODULE.bazel`\npatterns\n\nThank you especially to these folks, and to everyone who tested and provided feedback during our preview support for this ecosystem.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Dependency detection:** Dependabot scans your `MODULE.bazel`\n, `*.MODULE.bazel` , or WORKSPACE files and checks the Bazel central registry for updates.\n2. **Lockfile management:** Dependabot regenerates lockfiles to maintain reproducible builds.\n3. **Pull requests:** Dependabot opens pull requests with updated declarations, regenerated lockfiles, release notes, and compatibility information.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRequirements include:\n\n- Bazel 7, 8, or 9\n- A `MODULE.bazel`\nor `WORKSPACE` file at the repository root\n- Engage with [the Dependabot open source community](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2196) on the topic of Bazel support.\n- Learn more in [our Dependabot version updates documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates).\n- Learn more about [Bazel](https://bazel.build/).",
