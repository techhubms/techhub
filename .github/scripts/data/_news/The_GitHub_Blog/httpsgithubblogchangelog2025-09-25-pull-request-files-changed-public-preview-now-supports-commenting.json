Navigate to the **new ‚ÄúFiles changed‚Äù page**.\n2. Select a changed file and expand all or part of the diff to reveal unchanged lines.\n3. Click the `+`\non a line and add your comment or include a suggested change, just like you normally would.\n\nThese comments will appear on the new ‚ÄúFiles changed‚Äù and the ‚ÄúConversation‚Äù pages.\n\n> >\n> **Note**: This feature is rolling out gradually on a per-repository basis.\n> >\n\n### Considerations\n\n1. If using the classic ‚ÄúFiles changed‚Äù page to view a pull request with comments on unchanged lines, a warning message will appear explaining that there are additional comments only available on the new page.\n2. These comments can only be added to files already changed (i.e., not unchanged files).\n3. API support is currently limited, but comments on unchanged lines will be returned by existing APIs and in webhook events.\n4. This feature changes the positioning logic for comments in general. If you notice any issues with comment positioning, let us know.\n\n## üöÄ Single file mode improvements\n\nSingle file mode, announced in the [last update](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-11-pull-request-files-changed-public-preview-experience-september-11-updates/) to help you view larger pull requests, has been improved:\n\n![Screenshot of the new files changed page in single file mode, with an arrow pointing to the next and previous buttons on the toolbar and an arrow pointing to the new message at the bottom of the page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/434fd43d-0768-420f-bd3b-2f0626ba2d4b)\n\n- **New**: Marking a file as viewed automatically moves you to the next file.\n- **Fixed**: Navigating between files using the `Next file`\nor `Previous file` buttons now honors any file filters you have applied.\n- **New**: Keyboard shortcuts are now available for navigating to the next (`J`\n) or previous (`K` ) file.\n- **Improved**: To reduce confusion, a message now appears at the bottom of the page when the page is in single file mode.\n- **Improved**: Large and deleted files, which are not rendered by default, no longer influence the decision to apply single file mode.\n- **Fixed**: Various bugs related to unnecessary fetch requests, filtering, and more have been addressed.\n\n## üì£ Feedback\n\nYour feedback is super important to us! Visit us in the GitHub community:\n\n- [Feedback on the new ‚ÄúFiles changed‚Äù page](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback)\n- [Feedback on the feature enabling you to comment on any line](https://gh.io/comment-any-line-feedback)\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
