  "EnhancedContent": "The Copilot usage metrics dashboard and corresponding API are available in public preview for GitHub Enterprise.\n\nThe AI era of software development isn’t about **are** teams using AI, but rather **how well** are they using it?\n\nThe GitHub Copilot usage metrics dashboard and API, now in public preview for GitHub Enterprise customers using Copilot, helps you answer that question with data.\n\nYou can now see how Copilot adoption and engagement in the IDE varies across both your enterprise and your users to understand who’s using it, where, and how.\n\n## What’s included in the public preview\n\nThe **Copilot usage metrics dashboard** gives enterprise administrators and billing managers direct visibility into Copilot usage and adoption under the **Insights** tab.\n\nT\n\nhe dashboard provides an aggregated enterprise view, while the NDJSON download or API offer user-level granularity for deeper analysis.\n\nIn this public preview, you’ll find metrics including:\n\n- Daily and weekly active users across GitHub Copilot IDE modes, including agent mode.\n- Agent adoption across your user base.\n- Lines of code added and deleted across all IDE modes.\n- Language and model usage patterns across IDEs.\n\nThese metrics help you understand:\n\n- **Overall usage and adoption**: Review indicators like weekly usage provide a broad view of Copilot adoption across your enterprise.\n- **Specific model, feature, and language usage**: See which AI models and programming languages are most utilized by your teams, highlighting areas for even greater value.\n- **Agent adoption percentage**: Track how many developers are using Copilot for advanced tasks like refactoring, debugging, and complex problem solving. High agent adoption signals a shift toward truly transformative coding.\n\nTogether, these are foundational metrics showing who’s adopting Copilot, how consistently, and what that usage looks like across your enterprise.\n\n## How to enable Copilot usage metrics in your enterprise\n\nBy default, **Copilot usage metrics** are disabled unless your enterprise participated in the private preview, in which case they remain enabled.\n\nEnterprise admins can enable them as follows:\n\n1. Navigate to your **AI Controls** tab on github.com.\n2. Select **Copilot** in the left sidebar.\n3. Scroll down to the “Metrics” section where you’ll see **Copilot usage metrics**.\n4. Change the **Copilot usage metrics** policy setting to **Enabled**. This will enable the Copilot usage metrics dashboard and API for your enterprise, allowing enterprise administrators and billing managers to view usage and adoption data.\n\nOnce enabled, you can access the Copilot usage metrics dashboard directly from the **Insights** tab at the enterprise level or through the [Enterprise and user-level API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/early-access/copilot-metrics/apis/about-the-copilot-metrics-apis?utm_source=changelog-docs-copilot-usage-metrics-dashboard&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25).\n\n## Learn more\n\nView the Copilot [usage metrics dashboard documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/early-access/copilot-metrics/dashboards/about-the-copilot-metrics-dashboard?utm_source=changelog-docs-copilot-usage-metrics-dashboard&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25).\n\nExplore the [Copilot usage metrics API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/early-access/copilot-metrics/apis/about-the-copilot-metrics-apis?utm_source=changelog-docs-copilot-usage-metrics-dashboard&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25).\n\nJoin the [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/177155?utm_source=changelog-community-copilot-usage-metrics-dashboard&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25) to share your feedback and ask questions.\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
