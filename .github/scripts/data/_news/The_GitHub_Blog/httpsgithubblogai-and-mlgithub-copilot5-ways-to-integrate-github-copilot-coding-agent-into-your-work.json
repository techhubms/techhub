  "EnhancedContent": "If you‚Äôve already tried [GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/coding-agent/coding-agent), you know the basics: assign a task, let it work in the background, and review the pull request when it‚Äôs done.\n\nBut what if you‚Äôre ready to move beyond the basics?\n\nWe got you. In this tutorial, we‚Äôll explore five powerful strategies to integrate the coding agent deeper into your development workflow. From tackling tech debt to validating UI changes and experimenting with branch strategies, let‚Äôs unlock Copilot‚Äôs full potential.\n\nLet‚Äôs go!\n\n**1. Offload tech debt with the Agents panel**\n\nTech debt is like weeds in your garden: ignore it, and it spreads everywhere.\n\nYou know that pile of ‚Äúwe should really fix this someday‚Äù tasks sitting in your backlog? The dependency upgrades, lingering feature flags, small refactors that everyone avoids because they‚Äôre boring but necessary?\n\nI used to let those pile up until they became weekend projects. Not anymore.\n\nThe new [Agents panel](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-19-agents-panel-launch-copilot-coding-agent-tasks-anywhere-on-github-com/) lets me batch these tedious-but-important tasks and hand them off to Copilot while I focus on actual feature development.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Open your repository on GitHub.com and click the **Agents panel button**.\n2. Describe your task:\n\n- *‚ÄúUpdate the extension manifest to support VS Code 1.104‚Äù*\n- *‚ÄúAdd TypeScript strict mode and fix all resulting type errors‚Äù*\n3. Hit **Start task** and let Copilot do the rest.\n\nüëâ **Pro tip**: Batch small cleanup tasks into separate requests. [Each task only costs one premium request](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests#what-are-premium-requests), and you‚Äôll get neatly scoped pull requests you can merge independently.\n\n## **2. Validate UI changes with Playwright MCP**\n\nFront-end changes usually come with a side quest: Spin up the app locally, poke around the UI, and hope nothing‚Äôs broken. Copilot‚Äôs Playwright MCP server integration changes this completely. It can spin up your application, interact with it, and capture screenshots automatically.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. From the Agents panel, describe the task:\n*‚ÄúAdd internationalization support for English, French, and Spanish.‚Äù*\n2. Copilot generates the code, uses the Playwright MCP server to run your app in a browser, and captures **screenshots for the pull request**.\n3. Review the screenshots directly in the pull request before checking out the branch locally.\n\n![Square image](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/playwright.gif)\n\nüëâ **Pro tip**: This is great for validating responsive designs, dark mode toggles, or any UI change where a screenshot is worth a thousand code reviews.\n\n## **3. Experiment safely with branch strategies**\n\nNot every idea is ready for prime time. Sometimes you need a safe space to let Copilot experiment without touching your main branch. And here‚Äôs what makes Copilot‚Äôs branch handling really powerful: You can pick any branch as your starting point, not just the default.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. From the Agents panel, describe the task:\n‚Äú*Add real time flight tracking with live delay notifications‚Äù*\n2. **Choose your base branch** from the dropdown: Maybe you want to build on `feature/booking-system`\ninstead of main.\n3. Copilot creates a `copilot/`\nbranch from your selected base branch and opens a draft pull request for your review.\n\n1. Review the pull request and give Copilot feedback through pull request comments, as seen in the gif below:\n\n![Square image](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mentioncopilot-4.gif)\n\nüëâ **Pro tip**: Use dedicated branches to showcase prototypes in demos ‚Äî clean, isolated, and easy to discard if needed.\n\n## **4. Choose the right entry point for your task**\n\nYou wouldn‚Äôt use a screwdriver when you need a hammer, and the same goes for assigning tasks to Copilot. With multiple entry points (Agents panel, GitHub Issues, Your favorite IDE, GitHub Mobile), the trick is knowing which one fits the moment.\n\nMy best fits:\n\n- **Agents panel:** Perfect for ad hoc tasks while browsing GitHub ‚Äî ideal when you‚Äôre reviewing issues or planning work.\n- **GitHub Issues:** Great if your team already tracks work in Issues. Just assign directly to Copilot and it becomes part of your existing workflow.\n- **VS Code:** Use for quick refactors spotted while coding ‚Äî no context switching required.\n- **Mobile app:** Surprisingly useful for small tasks or follow-ups when you‚Äôre away from your desk.\n\nüëâ **Pro tip**: Don‚Äôt overthink it. The best entry point is the one closest to where inspiration strikes.\n\n## **5. Extend Copilot Coding Agent with MCP servers**\n\nHere‚Äôs where things get interesting. Copilot gets smarter when it has more context to work with. Out of the box, it ships with two powerful Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:\n\n**Default MCP servers:**\n\n- **Playwright MCP:** Enables browser automation and screenshot capabilities for testing web applications\n- **GitHub MCP:** Provides awareness of GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and other GitHub-specific context.\n\nBut it can become ever more powerful when you extend this ecosystem with custom MCP servers, for example:\n\n- **Notion MCP:** Pull in project specs or notes.\n- **Hugging Face MCP:** Access AI models and datasets for machine learning features.\n\nThe recently launched open source [MCP Registry](http://modelcontextprotocol/registry) provides a centralized place to discover, publish, and manage MCP server integrations. Check it out to see what others have built or to contribute your own.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nüëâ **Pro tip**: For implementation examples, visit the [VS Code Insider page](https://code.visualstudio.com/insider/mcp), which offers a curated list of MCP servers across categories like Developer Tools, Productivity, Data & Analytics, Business Services, and Cloud & Infrastructure ‚Äî all installable with a click.\n\nThese five workflows demonstrate how Copilot evolves from a suggestion tool into an essential development partner with the coding agent. By integrating it into your daily routine, you‚Äôre not just saving time, you‚Äôre fundamentally changing how you approach development challenges.\n\nThink about it: Those tech debt items that used to languish for months? Now automated. The UI validations that demanded context-switching? Handled with screenshots. The experimental features you were hesitant to build? Safely prototyped in isolated branches.\n\nThe big wins: When teams stop seeing Copilot as just another coding tool and start treating it as a collaborator that unlocks new possibilities in your dev workflow.\n\n## **Your next steps**\n\nDon‚Äôt just read about these workflows, experience them. Choose one task from your backlog right now (we all have them), open the Agents panel in your repository, and hand it off to Copilot. Then use those reclaimed hours to tackle the creative challenges only us humans can solve.\n\nAs AI-assisted development continues to evolve, the developers who thrive won‚Äôt be those who code the fastest, they‚Äôll be the ones who masterfully orchestrate their AI tools to amplify their impact.\n\nWhat will you build with your new teammate?\n\n[Read the Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/coding-agent/coding-agent) to learn more about GitHub Copilot coding agent &gt;",
