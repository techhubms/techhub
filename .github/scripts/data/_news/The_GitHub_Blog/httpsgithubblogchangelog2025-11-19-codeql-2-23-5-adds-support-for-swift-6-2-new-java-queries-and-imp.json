  "EnhancedContent": "CodeQL is the static analysis engine behind GitHub code scanning, which finds and remediates security issues in your code. We’ve recently released [CodeQL 2.23.5](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.23.5/), introducing three new Java security queries for detecting concurrency issues and improving the accuracy of your code scanning results.\n\n**Language and framework support**\n\n- **Swift**: CodeQL now supports Swift 6.2, ensuring you can analyze projects built with this version.\n- **Rust**: We’ve added support for the `actix-web`\nweb framework and extended support for the `mysql` and `mysql_async` libraries.\n- **C#**: We’ve added tracer support for macOS and Linux when the .NET CLI (`dotnet`\n) directly invokes the C# compiler (`csc` ), providing basic tracing and extraction capabilities for .NET 10 RC2 on these platforms.\n\n**Query changes**\n\n**C#**\n\n- We’ve completely rewritten the `cs/dereferenced-value-may-be-null`\nquery, which removes a very significant number of false positives. This query has also been changed from a `path-problem` query to a `problem` query, so paths are no longer reported.\n- We’ve updated the `cs/constant-condition`\nquery to report a wider range of high confidence results.\n- We’ve improved the `cs/web/missing-x-frame-options`\nquery, so it now correctly handles configuration nested in root “ elements.\n\n**Java/Kotlin**\n\n- We’ve promoted the `java/sensitive-cookie-not-httponly`\nquery from experimental to the main query pack.\n- We’ve added three new queries to detect concurrency issues in classes marked as `@ThreadSafe`:\n- `java/escaping`\ndetects values escaping from thread-safe classes.\n- `java/not-threadsafe`\ndetects data races in thread-safe classes.\n- `java/safe-publication`\ndetects unsafe publication in thread-safe classes.\n- Calls to `String.matches`\nare now treated as sanitizers for the `java/ssrf` query, which can reduce the occurrence of false positives.\n\n**Python**\n\n- We’ve split the `py/insecure-cookie`query into multiple queries:\n- `py/insecure-cookie`\nchecks for cases where the `Secure` flag isn’t set.\n- `py/client-exposed-cookie`\nchecks for cases where the `HttpOnly` flag isn’t set.\n- `py/samesite-none`\nchecks for cases where the `SameSite` attribute is set to `None` .\n- These queries now only alert when the cookie is detected to contain sensitive data.\n\nFor a full list of changes, refer to the complete [changelog for version 2.23.5](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-overview/codeql-changelog/codeql-cli-2.23.5/).\n\n**Availability**\n\nEach new version of CodeQL is automatically deployed to users of GitHub code scanning on github.com. The new functionality in CodeQL 2.23.5 will also be included in GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) release 3.20. If you use an older version of GHES, [manually upgrade your CodeQL version](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.18/admin/managing-code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access).",
