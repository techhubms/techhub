This gives you programmatic access to create, update, and delete custom properties with your existing workflows and automation tools.\n\nTo learn more, see [the GraphQL API documentation for custom properties](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference). **Note:** there is a delay in publishing GraphQL documentation and may take 24 hours to go live.\n\n### New URL property type\n\n![The GitHub \"New property\" interface showing the configuration for a custom property named \"AzureK8Fleet\" with the type set to URL. The form includes a default value linking directly to the Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Fleet portal.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb05d0b9-2093-4cc5-8d1e-f761bb75da5a)\n\nCustom repository properties now support a `URL` type with built-in validation. This makes it easier for admins to attach relevant resources to repositories like runbooks, monitoring dashboards, or external documentation without worrying about invalid URLs.\n\nWhen you create a `URL` property, GitHub automatically validates that values are properly formatted URLs, ensuring consistency across your organization.\n\nFor more information, see [our documentation about managing custom repository properties](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization).\n\nShare your feedback in our [community discussion](https://gh.io/props-gql-url-discussion).",
