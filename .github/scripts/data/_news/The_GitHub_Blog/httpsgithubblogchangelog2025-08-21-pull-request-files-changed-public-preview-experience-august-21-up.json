  "EnhancedContent": "Check out the latest updates to the [new pull request ‚ÄúFiles changed‚Äù page](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-26-improved-pull-request-files-changed-experience-now-in-public-preview/) public preview, including submodule support, improvements to the review submission panel, and lots of fixes.\n\n## ‚ú® Improved review submission panel\n\nBased on your feedback, the panel for submitting a review now appears below the `Submit review` button and allows the page to be scrolled. It still shows pending comments, but the buttons are much closer and require less mouse travel. You can also now submit your review by pressing `Command` (or `Ctrl` ) + `Enter` .\n\nIf you have pending comments, you can click the `Expand this section` button in the header of the panel to expand the panel to the full height of the page as shown in this video:\n\n## üîó Submodule support\n\nWhen a submodule reference is updated in a pull request, the changes being introduced in that update are now listed and can be reviewed individually. This helps you understand the actual changes being introduced in an update to a submodule.\n\n![Screenshot of a diff on the pull request Files Changed page for an update to a submodule reference in the pull request](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a509f03-a584-4b56-add0-c129a91a64d6)\n\n## üîß Fixes\n\n- **Fixed**: The option to ignore whitespace-only changes is no longer reset when refreshing the page and is remembered for each pull request.\n- **Fixed**: Previously, showing changes from all commits would not show the latest changes if the page was filtered on a subset of commits.\n- **Fixed**: The animation that appears below the changed files no longer loops.\n- **Fixed**: Various issues with pending comments not appearing or appearing incorrectly on the review submission panel.\n- **Fixed**: Unexpected blank lines are no longer added when copying multiple lines of a diff.\n- **Fixed**: Expanding hunks in a diff would previously fail or not honor the setting to ignore whitespace-only changes.\n- **Fixed**: Delays when switching between tabs when viewing a pull request with a large number of changes have been reduced.\n\n## üöß Known issues\n\nThe new page still has some gaps that we plan to address, including:\n\n- Reviewing a single commit\n- Applying multiple suggested changes (batching)\n- Keyboard shortcuts for showing / hiding comments and annotations\n\nAlso, the new page is still limited to only showing the first **300** files of the pull request. If you need to view larger pull requests, you can switch over to the classic page.\n\nCheck out the feedback discussion for [an up-to-date list of known issues](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback).\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏è Feedback\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt tried the improved experience yet, click the **Try the new experience** link at the top of the existing pull request ‚ÄúFiles changed‚Äù page.\n\nYour feedback is super important to us! To report problems, ask questions, see the latest news, and more, visit the [feedback discussion](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback).\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
