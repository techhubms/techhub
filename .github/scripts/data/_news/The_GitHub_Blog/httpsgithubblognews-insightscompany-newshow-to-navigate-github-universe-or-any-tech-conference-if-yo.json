  "EnhancedContent": "We know that the idea of big tech conferences can be overwhelming, especially if you’re introverted, anxious, or are used to spending most of your day behind your computer. (Which is most of us.) And that’s okay!\n\nThe good news is that GitHub Universe was designed for folks like you. This isn’t just one long conference in a room with thousands of people and no exit. Universe offers all sorts of opportunities to take breaks, hang in small groups, or watch virtually, so that you can learn and network at whatever pace works for you. We’ve built in events to make the experience extra comfortable, safe, and exciting for all.\n\n[[Get your IRL pass](https://githubuniverse.com/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=tech_conference_introvert)]\n\nIf you’ve already got your pass but are feeling a bit shaky on how it’ll all go, here are some practical tips for how to navigate tech conferences, like GitHub Universe.\n\n## 1. Attend smaller sessions or workshops\n\nInstead of signing up for the largest, busiest sessions, go for the smaller workshops, niche panels, and breakout sessions. Small-group sessions often foster deeper connections and conversations, and they can help keep you from getting lost in the crowd.\n\nThis year’s Universe will feature many **interactive workshops** ([explore the full list](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?search.sessiontype=1681826483038003zyr1)), where the guest list will be small, and the conversations will be deep. You can also add demo-style **sandbox sessions** to your agenda, which include practical exercises, to keep your mind engaged!\n\nYou may also want to check out gatherings in our **discussions lounge**, where two to three facilitators will guide small groups through specific topics of interest, prioritizing active participation and collaboration.\n\n![Attendees working on laptops during conference session in presentation room.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image8.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## 2. Find quiet zones and recharge spaces\n\nWe all know that introverts recharge alone. So if you need to step away and take some time to reflect, you should!\n\nAt Universe, we’ve created **dedicated lounges and recharge spaces**, so you don’t have to choose between skipping content and protecting your peace. Need a few minutes to unwind? We’ll have a quiet room for phone-free decompression, meditation, and prayer. We’ll also have plenty of drink options, snacks, and meals available if you need to keep your blood sugar up.\n\nAnd don’t forget to step outside and take in the stunning waterfront views at Fort Mason—a quick breath of ocean air can do wonders between sessions.\n\n![Sunset view across the bay with birds flying over water and hills in background.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image7-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## 3. Join curated networking activities\n\nIf large mixers without a planned topic of conversation feel daunting, you can look for guided or themed activities where the conversation already has a starting point.\n\nAt Universe, you can connect with people who share your passions at [structured networking meetup spots](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/explore-the-best-of-github-universe-9-spaces-built-to-spark-creativity-connection-and-joy/), including:\n\n- **Recess!:** Meet fellow attendees over your shared interests beyond the code. Whether you’re a Lego enthusiast or a die-hard Swiftie, there’s an opportunity for everyone to connect and simply have fun.\n- **Makerspace:** Create interactive projects, from art to AI and music to robotics. Whether you build or just tinker, this is your playground.\n- **Open Source Zone:** Connect with contributors and maintainers, explore open source projects, and celebrate the power of community-led software.\n\n![Person at table assembling colorful LEGO buildings including a tower and house with organized brick containers.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image3-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## 4. Set personal goals and boundaries\n\nDecide ahead of time what you want to get out of the event. Take a look at the agenda. What are your must-see sessions? Who are the people you want to meet? Build in plenty of breaks—without guilt!\n\nDid you know that we offer a **Universe agenda builder, curated schedules**, and **[content tracks](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-universe-2025-heres-whats-in-store-at-this-years-developer-wonderland/#h-what-you-ll-experience)**, so you can figure out the right sessions for your interests and goals? This makes it simple to stick to your plan (and pace yourself!).\n\n![Conference attendee in checkered blazer reading event map in crowded exhibition hall.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image4-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## 5. Bring a conversation starter\n\nWearing a T-shirt, pin, or sticker related to your passions makes it easy for someone else to approach *you*. It may even give you the confidence to approach someone else, too.\n\nUniverse swag (and plenty of community stickers) are designed to help spark those natural, low-pressure conversations. And if you don’t have any swag before the event, you can always visit **The GitHub Shop** and grab something day-of. We’ll have a brand new GitHub Universe collection, so you’ll be able to rep our latest and greatest.\n\n![Two attendees having conversation at tech conference, one wearing GitHub Star tag and blue cap.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image6-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## 6. Take it online with livestream or on-demand sessions\n\nIf attending in-person still doesn’t feel right, don’t forget that you can attend GitHub Universe virtually or catch keynotes and select session recordings later on-demand. Our goal: Make sure you can still participate and stay connected in a way that works best for you.\n\nTo note: This might not always be an option at other tech conferences or events, but it’s always worth checking to see if there are ways to learn and connect from home if that’s your preferred method.\n\n![Speaker presenting GitHub Models to large audience with \"A new generation of AI engineers on GitHub\" displayed on screen.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image5-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope you see you at GitHub Universe this year. Don’t forget that however you plan to attend—in-person, virtually, just a few workshops, or somewhere in between—it’s all in your control. Whether you’re introverted (like us) or extroverted, or somewhere in between, we hope you have the best time!\n\n[[Register now](https://githubuniverse.com/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=tech_conference_introvert)]\n\n![View of Alcatraz Island through a colorful art installation frame with visitors silhouetted at waterfront.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image2-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)",
