  "EnhancedContent": "[Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent) is our asynchronous, autonomous background agent. Delegate a task to Copilot, and it works in the background, then requests a review from you.\n\nWhen Copilot starts work, it creates a new branch and opens a draft pull request. Copilot now uses clearer, more helpful branch names and pull request titles.\n\nInstead of a randomly generated branch name (e.g., `copilot/fix-bdaf7923-9865-4ef5-8c17-05ae939937a3` ), you’ll get a branch name that fits the work Copilot is doing (e.g., `copilot/add-theme-switcher` ).\n\nInstead of using your original prompt for the initial pull request title, Copilot will automatically generate a title. For example, if you entered the prompt `Implement a CSV to Markdown converter in Rust. Ensure that it has CI/CD configured with GitHub Actions` , you might get the pull request title “Implement CSV to Markdown converter with GitHub Actions workflows”.\n\nCopilot coding agent is available to Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise subscribers. If you’re a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscriber, an administrator will have to [enable Copilot coding agent from the “Policies” page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/enabling-copilot-coding-agent) before you can use it.",
