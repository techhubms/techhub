  "EnhancedContent": "### New ruleset bypass type\n\nGitHub repository rulesets now let you exempt specific actors (users, teams, or GitHub Apps) from all enforced rules with a new `exempt` bypass type. Unlike a standard bypass (i.e., a “break glass” action that requires an explicit actor bypass and generates prominent audit signals), an exemption silently skips enforcement. Use it for trusted, high-volume automation or migration scenarios where friction would otherwise slow you down.\n\n#### Key benefits\n\n- Reduce friction for trusted high-volume automation (migration or integration bots)\n- Speed large repository migrations without disabling rules\n- Match classic branch protection behavior for “Restrict who can push”\n\n#### How to configure an exemption\n\n1. Open the repository ruleset.\n2. Find the actor in the “Bypass” list.\n3. Open the context menu by clicking **…**\n4. Select **Exempt**.\n\n![Context menu showing the Exempt option for a bypass entry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6add6d44-0435-4668-ad9e-32a0ce9a29a7)\n\n### Accessible repository insights traffic and pulse pages\n\nGitHub repository insights traffic and pulse pages now support more accessible graphs that screen readers can interpret. You can also switch graphs to a tabular view or download the underlying data as a CSV or PNG.\n\n**Note:** On the traffic insights page, “Referring sites” and “Popular content” data is temporarily unavailable or may display inaccurately. We’re working to restore it.\n\nJoin the discussion in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/repositories).",
