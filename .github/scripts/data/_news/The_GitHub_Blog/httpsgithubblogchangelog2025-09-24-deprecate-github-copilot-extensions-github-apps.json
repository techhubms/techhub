  "EnhancedContent": "### What’s changing\n\nWe are deprecating GitHub Copilot Extensions (built as GitHub Apps) on November 10, 2025, in favor of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers. MCP provides a universal standard for AI agent integration—build an MCP server once and use it across any compatible agent or chatbot, not just GitHub Copilot.\n\n### Who this affects\n\nThis change affects developers who have built or use Copilot Extensions as GitHub Apps.\n\nThis does NOT affect:\n\n- Client-side VS Code Copilot Extensions (remain fully supported)\n- Standard GitHub Apps (without Copilot Extension functionality)\n\n### Why this change matters\n\nGitHub Copilot Extensions only work within GitHub Copilot chat. If developers want their tools to work with other AI assistants, they have to build separate integrations for each one. MCP addresses this by providing an open standard that’s modular and easy to integrate into a variety of AI assistants and agents. Build your server once and it works with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and any other MCP-compatible host app. We’re focusing on MCP because developers shouldn’t have to rebuild the same functionality for every platform.\n\n### What you should do\n\n- If you have an existing extension: Plan your replacement strategy. Your extension will stop working November 10, 2025 by 11:59 PM PST.\n- If you have a hybrid app: Disable the Copilot Extension configuration in your GitHub App settings before November 10 by 11:59 PM PST to keep your app in the Marketplace.\n- Start building with MCP today: Visit [the GitHub MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) to explore existing servers, or check out Anthropic’s [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server) to start building your own.\n- No new Copilot Extensions: Creation of new server-side Copilot Extensions is blocked after September 24, 2025 at 8:00 AM PST.\n\n### Key dates\n\n- **September 24, 2025**: New extension creation blocked\n- **November 3–7, 2025**: Brownout testing period (temporary service interruptions)\n- **November 10, 2025**: Full sunset—all Copilot Extensions disabled\n\n**Frequently asked questions**\n\n**Q: Why is GitHub making this change?**\n\nOur north star remains the same: what creates the most value for developers? Extensions helped us explore what was possible, but as the landscape evolved, it became clear that an open standard like MCP unlocks more opportunity for the entire ecosystem. Therefore, we’re going to take that path. Here are some key advantages of MCP:\n\n\\* Cross-platform compatibility across all Copilot environments and MCP-compatible host apps\n\n\\* More modular and composable architecture\n\n\\* Simplified maintenance and better performance\n\n\\* Smoother user experience with autonomous tool-calling\n\n**Q: What happens to existing Copilot Extensions after November 10 at 11:59 PM PST?**\n\nAll Copilot Extension functionality will be completely disabled. For the Marketplace:\n\n\\* **Copilot Extension-only apps**: Will be removed from the Marketplace\n\n\\* **Hybrid apps** (with other GitHub App features): Can remain in the GitHub Marketplace if you disable the Copilot Extension configuration in your app settings before November 10 by 11:59 PM PST\n\n\\* **User experience**: @mentions of retired extensions will be treated as plain text. Existing VS Code extensions will remain unchanged and can still be invoked with an @mention.\n\n**Q: Can I convert my Copilot Extension to a regular GitHub App?**\n\nIf your app has both Copilot Extension and GitHub App functionality (leverages other GitHub APIs, aside from just Copilot Chat), the GitHub App features will continue working after November 10. However, if your App/Extension is listed on the GitHub Marketplace, you must disable the Copilot Extension configuration in your app settings before the sunset date to ensure your app remains publicly listed.\n\n**Q: What about private/internal Copilot Extensions?**\n\nThese follow the same sunset timeline and will be disabled on November 10, 2025.\n\n**Q: How do I replace my Copilot Extension with an MCP server?**\n\nRead the [MCP server developer documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server) to learn more about building an MCP server. Note that MCP servers are architecturally different from Copilot Extensions, so this is a replacement rather than a migration. MCP servers offer:\n\n\\* Individual tool-calling with “#” symbol in IDEs instead of @mentions\n\n\\* Autonomous tool invocation by Agent Mode and Copilot Coding Agent\n\n\\* Build once and use across any MCP-compatible host app (not just GitHub Copilot)\n\n**Q: Is there feature parity between Extensions and MCP?**\n\nMCP servers can replicate much of the functionality as Copilot Extensions, but MCP servers and Copilot Extensions are architecturally different—especially when comparing agent-based extensions.\n\n**Q: What support is available?**\n\nWe provide documentation and community forums. Our guides cover common scenarios and best practices for building MCP servers.\n\n**Q: What happens to the Copilot Extensions category in the Marketplace?**\n\nThe category will be removed after November 10. Hybrid apps must disable their Extension configuration in the Copilot App settings before November 10 to remain listed in the GitHub Apps category.\n\n**Q: How will users discover MCP servers?**\n\nThe [GitHub MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) is live now, providing a curated directory of MCP servers. Users can also discover MCP servers by browsing repositories on GitHub, as most are open source projects.\n\n**Q: How will admin controls work with MCP?**\n\nMCP servers support organization-level Enable/Disable/Allowlist policies. Per-server allowlist functionality is rolling out to IDEs starting October 28, 2025.",
