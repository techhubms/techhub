  "EnhancedContent": "Every developer has that project they build just for the fun of it. You know how it goes: you start by asking ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù and then you have something weird and wonderful hours later.\n\nThis summer, we decided to celebrate that spirit with [**For the Love of Code**](https://github.blog/open-source/for-the-love-of-code-2025/), our first-ever competition for projects built purely for fun. More than 300 developers answered the call. Some leaned on GitHub Copilot to refactor ideas, fix bugs, and spark inspiration. Some teamed up. Others flew solo, guided only by caffeine and curiosity.\n\nEntries spanned everything from a [Breakout game powered by your GitHub graph](https://github.com/cyprieng/github-breakout), to a [laugh-track that plays on every commit](https://github.com/sanaysarthak/git-laugh-track), [a Yelp-style code reviewer in VS Code](https://github.com/NeoKish/vscode-yelp-style-reviewer) ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ, a [Copilot you can literally see on camera](https://github.com/leereilly/copilot-cam), and even a [comic strip made from your release notes](https://github.com/GustyCube/pr-notes-comic-strip).\n\nWe invited participants to build anything that sparks joy across six whimsical categories:\n\n- **üîò Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights:** Hardware hacks, LEDs, sensors, and gadgets galore.\n- üñ•Ô∏è **Terminal talent:** Command-line creations and retro computing love letters.\n- **üåê World wide wonders:** Browser-based experiments, apps, and interactive art.\n- **ü§ñ Agents of change:** AI, bots, and automation with heart.\n- **üïπÔ∏è Game on:** Games big or small, serious or silly.\n- üÉè **Everything but the kitchen sink:** The wildcard (if it doesn‚Äôt fit anywhere else, it fits here).\n\n## Meet the winners: Open source experiments, AI side projects, and more\n\nHere are the top three entries from each category.\n\n## üîò Buttons, beeps & blinkenlights\n\n### Plane Tracker: DIY radar on your desk\n\n![A person holding an Adafruit TFT Gizmo display connected to a laptop.
