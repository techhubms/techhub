It also does not consume usage quota.\n\nOrganizations and enterprises can enable this and other features in public preview by selecting **Opt in to preview features** in the [Copilot in github.com setting](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features). If your Enterprise has [rulesets for commit metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/available-rules-for-rulesets#metadata-restrictions) enabled, you will still see a default commit message in commits made in organization-related files. This feature is also available in GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/170558), or [give us feedback on this feature](https://forms.gle/pBtcV9BCAgq7udMV9).\n\n# New Copilot Spaces features\n\nWe’ve also launched the following features for [GitHub Copilot Spaces](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-copilot-spaces). You’re now able to do the following:\n\n- Select and link an entire repository to your space\n- Add a code file via URL or from the code view\n- Select a directory, which will watch for all future files added under that directory\n- Select a branch\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*"
