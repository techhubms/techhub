  "EnhancedContent": "A major feature gap with the classic “Files changed” page (**review commit-by-commit**) is now closed and commit filtering has been improved in this update to the pull request “Files changed” experience!\n\n## 🔍 Review commit-by-commit\n\nYou can now review all commits, a subset of commits, or a single commit directly from the new “Files changed” page. Previously, filtering to a single commit redirected you to the classic view in the **Commits** tab. With this update, you remain on the “Files changed” page whether you are viewing all commits, selected commits, or an individual commit.\n\n![The new commit selector menu with options to show all commits, show commits since last review (which is disabled), or choose a list of commits](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27e65cc2-614d-414a-9b82-37aa845b79f1)\n\nWe’ve also simplified all “Files changed” URL routes under a new path (`/changes` ). All existing `/files` (and `/commits/:sha` ) URLs will continue to work, but they will redirect to the equivalent `/changes` route when you have the new feature enabled.\n\nWe’ve also improved the commit filter, and it requires fewer clicks to choose a range or a single commit! You can open it from the toolbar or by pressing `C` if you’ve enabled single-key shortcuts.\n\n## 📁 File filter improvements\n\nWe’ve also improved the file filter to show a blue dot indicator to help you understand when filters are applied. A new **Clear filters** option also now appears on the filter menu to make it easy to reset all filters back to their default state.\n\n![The improved file filter menu that shows a blue dot when any filters are applied and provides a \"clear filter\" button to reset all filters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e894002-0157-4dc0-ad64-e26ada7a017a)\n\n## 🚀 Performance\n\nImproving performance is one of our top priorities and you will continue to see both small and large improvements over the coming weeks. Recent improvements:\n\n- Improved responsiveness of resizing the file tree\n- Improved performance when toggling **Minimize comments** or **Split / Unified** settings\n\n## 🔧 More fixes and improvements\n\n- **Improved**: Clicking the **Refresh** button when new changes are pushed to the pull request no longer does a full (and often slow) page refresh.\n- **Fixed**: The Comments side panel should no longer report an error when resolving a comment that is already resolved.\n- **Fixed**: Nonstandard characters in the file path (like a comma) no longer cause diffs to not load correctly.\n- **Fixed**: The `linguist-generated`\nattribute in `.gitattributes` is now appropriately respected.\n- **Fixed**: The `T`\nkeyboard shortcut once again focuses on the file filter field and shows the file tree if necessary.\n- **Fixed**: The `C`\nkeyboard shortcut once again opens the commit filter.\n\n## 🧪 Try it out\n\nThe new commit-by-commit review and commit selector are available in the new “Files changed” experience. If you are still using the classic experience, click **Try the new experience** at the top of the classic “Files changed” page.\n\n## ❤ Feedback\n\nYour feedback is important. You can report problems, ask questions, and view known issues in the [“Files changed” preview feedback discussion](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback).",
