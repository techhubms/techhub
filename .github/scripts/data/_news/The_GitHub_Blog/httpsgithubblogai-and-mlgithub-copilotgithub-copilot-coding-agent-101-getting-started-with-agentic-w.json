  "EnhancedContent": "Earlier this year, GitHub introduced an integrated, enterprise-ready [coding agent](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/) for [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Coding agent is a software engineering (SWE) agent that runs independently in the background to complete assigned tasks — similar to a peer developer.\n\nThe agent starts its work when you hand it a task. Then it spins up a fully customizable development environment, powered by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). You can track it every step of the way, from issue to pull request to review to approval.\n\nThe agent is designed to help you offload tasks like fixing bugs, test coverage, or refactoring code, so you can work on what interests you most. ✨\n\nLet’s learn more about coding agent, how it works, and how you can use it to work more efficiently.\n\n## What is GitHub Copilot coding agent?\n\nDesigned to amplify developer workflows and tackle assigned tasks end to end, GitHub Copilot coding agent works as your asynchronous AI teammate. You can hand tasks to coding agent multiple ways:\n\n- **GitHub Issues:** [Assign an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/assign-copilot-to-an-issue) to Copilot on github.com or GitHub Mobile.\n- **Visual Studio Code:** Delegate tasks to Copilot and track running tasks with the [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).\n- **Agents panel:** Hand new tasks to Copilot and track existing tasks without navigating away from your current work by clicking **View all tasks**, or bookmark[github.com/copilot/agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents) for direct access.\n\nIt’s more than just a pair programmer. Coding agent takes on low-to-medium complexity tasks so you can focus on what matters to you. To do its work, the agent reviews your repository’s context, including related issues, pull request discussions, and custom instructions.\n\nCoding agent can help you:\n\n- Fix bugs\n- Implement incremental features\n- Refactor code\n- Improve test coverage\n- Update documentation\n- [Accelerate secret scanning](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-we-accelerated-secret-protection-engineering-with-copilot/)\n- [Address technical debt](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-the-github-billing-team-uses-the-coding-agent-in-github-copilot-to-continuously-burn-down-technical-debt/)\n\nBuilt with security in mind, coding agent’s pull requests require human approval before any CI/CD workflows run, which adds an additional layer of protection. And with built-in audit logs and branch protections, every change is reviewed before it ships to keep you in control.\n\n## How is coding agent different from traditional AI coding assistants?\n\nWhen it comes to using a traditional AI coding assistant in an IDE, any code you write is stored locally. The assistant helps write the code, but developers still do most of the heavy lifting. They have to create the branch, write commit messages, push changes, open and write the pull request, manage reviews, iterate, and repeat. Doing all this work takes valuable time and effort.\n\nOn the other hand, Copilot coding agent helps automate developer workflows. Rather than working in isolated IDE sessions, the agent operates directly within the GitHub pull request workflow. It asynchronously automates tedious tasks like branch creation, commit writing, and pull request reviews, making the process more transparent and collaborative. Every step is logged, visible, and open to team input — turning solo coding into a shared, streamlined experience.\n\n## How does coding agent work?\n\nDesigned to fit into your development flow on GitHub, Copilot coding agent is built directly into GitHub’s native control layer. It starts working when you [assign a GitHub Issue to Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/assign-copilot-to-an-issue), [start a task from the agents panel](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/agents-panel-launch-copilot-coding-agent-tasks-anywhere-on-github/), or [initiate a task from Copilot Chat in VS Code](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-copilot-chat-in-visual-studio-code). From there, the agent opens a draft pull request, pushes commits as it works, and logs key steps along the way so you can track its progress in real time.\n\nEven though coding agent does the work, you remain in control throughout the entire process. You can review, give feedback, and ask Copilot to iterate via pull request reviews.\n\nUnder the hood, Copilot runs in a secure, ephemeral development environment powered by GitHub Actions, which is the world’s largest (and GitHub’s native) automation and CI/CD ecosystem. In its development environment, Copilot can explore your codebase for context, make changes, run tests and linters, and more. You can [customize this development environment](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment) with the tools and dependencies you need, leveraging the catalog 25,000 community based actions.\n\n## How can I use coding agent in GitHub Copilot?\n\nThe process of using GitHub’s coding agent is similar to assigning a task to a teammate. To start, you can [assign an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/assign-copilot-to-an-issue) to @github on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), [GitHub Mobile](https://github.com/mobile), or the [CLI](https://cli.github.com/). You can use the[agents panel](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-the-agents-panel-or-page) on any page on [GitHub.com](http://github.com). You can also prompt Copilot directly from [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-chat) in your favorite IDE, or any [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/about-mcp)–supported tool. MCP lets you extend the agent’s capabilities with external data sources, and can even support vision models, so you can assign issues with screenshots or mockups.\n\n**Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use coding agent:**\n\n1. Hand a task to Copilot, for example by assigning an issue or [using the agents panel](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/agents-panel-launch-copilot-coding-agent-tasks-anywhere-on-github/)\n2. Coding agent opens a draft pull request tagged [WIP] that it uses to track and complete its work.\n3. Once Copilot is done, it will update the pull request with a clear title and description and tag you for review\n4. If anything needs to be changed, you can leave comments tagging @copilot on the draft pull request, and coding agent will use your feedback to iterate on its work.\n\n## Unlocking Copilot’s full potential with MCP\n\nWhen you pair Copilot with [Model Context Protocol](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/coding-agent/mcp-and-coding-agent) (MCP), its capabilities expand dramatically.\n\nMCP is an open standard that allows applications to share context with large language models (LLMs). Coding agent has both [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) and GitHub MCP servers built right in, and you can add your own.\n\nOne thing to note: Copilot’s access to the internet is limited by a [firewall](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-firewall), but default rules allow access to a number of hosts that Copilot uses to interact with GitHub or to download dependencies.\n\nTo get started, repository admins can configure MCP servers using a JSON file in the repo settings. Once enabled, coding agent uses these tools autonomously, streamlining workflows and reducing developer overhead.\n\nWhether you’re building a feature or [triaging bugs](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/debugging-ui-with-ai-github-copilot-agent-mode-meets-mcp-servers/), MCP turns Copilot into an even more context-aware, tool-savvy, and capable coding partner.\n\n## Take this with you\n\nCopilot coding agent can help you do your best work. It takes on the more tedious parts of development so you can stay in the zone, move faster, and focus on solving real problems.\n\nWhether you’re working on developing a brand new idea or simply trying to get through a long list of fixes, coding agent can help you build momentum — with less friction and more flow.
