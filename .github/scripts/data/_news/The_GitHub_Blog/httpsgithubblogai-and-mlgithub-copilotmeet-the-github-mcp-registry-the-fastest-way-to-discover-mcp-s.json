Learn how we’re working with the broader community on MCP publication and discovery.\n\nThe post [Meet the GitHub MCP Registry: The fastest way to discover MCP Servers](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/meet-the-github-mcp-registry-the-fastest-way-to-discover-mcp-servers/) appeared first on [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog).",
  "EnhancedContent": "If you’ve tried connecting AI agents to your development tools, you know the pain: MCP servers scattered across numerous registries, random repos, buried in community threads — making discovery slow and full of friction without a central place to go. Meanwhile, MCP server creators are worn out from publishing to multiple places and answering the same setup questions again and again.\n\nThe result is a fractured environment that’s fraught with potential security risks.\n\nToday, we’re taking the first step toward solving this challenge. The GitHub MCP Registry launches as your new home base for discovering MCP servers. Whether you’re building with GitHub Copilot, agents, or any AI tool that speaks MCP, this is the place to find what you need. With GitHub already home to most MCP servers, the MCP Registry makes them dramatically easier to discover, explore, and use — helping developers find the right tools faster and contribute to a more open, interoperable ecosystem. [Browse the MCP Registry today and start building with the tools that power agentic workflows.](http://github.com/mcp?utm_source=blog-source&amp;utm_campaign=mcp-registry-server-launch-2025)\n\n## Inside the GitHub MCP Registry\n\nWe’re starting simple and building in the open. The [MCP Registry](http://github.com/mcp?utm_source=blog-source&amp;utm_campaign=mcp-registry-server-launch-2025) launches with a curated directory of MCP servers from leading partners and the open source community. Each server is backed by its GitHub repository, so you can learn what it does, how to get started, and make informed choices quickly.\n\n**Here’s what you’ll find:**\n\n- Discoverability inside VS Code with one-click installation\n- Signal over noise with servers sorted by GitHub stars and community activity\n- Works with your stack including GitHub Copilot and any MCP-compatible host\n\nFrom day one, the MCP Registry is shaped by contributions from across the ecosystem — including our launch partners who are helping define what the quality of MCP servers look like. This collaborative foundation ensures developers have access to tools they can trust, and sets the stage for a healthier, more interoperable AI ecosystem.\n\n![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mcp2.jpg?resize=1024%2C538)\n\n> >\n> With the launch of GitHub’s MCP Registry, developers can easily bring Figma context into Copilot through our Dev Mode MCP server, accelerating their design-to-code workflow by generating code that’s both production-ready and aligned with their design system.\n> >\n> Anna Kohnen, VP of Business Development, Figma\n\n> >\n> At Postman, we see MCP as a foundational layer of the AI agents stack and a vital part of building AI-ready APIs. The GitHub MCP Registry helps developers access the entire Postman platform from inside their coding assistants, further bridging the gap between code, documentation, and execution in a way that wasn’t possible before.\n> >\n> Bajali Raghavan, Head of Engineering, Postman\n\n> >\n> Terraform empowers developers with consistent infrastructure management. With the launch of GitHub’s MCP Registry, they can now easily discover official MCP servers, such as HashiCorp’s Terraform MCP server, and add them to their workflows with a single click—making it faster than ever to bring Terraform’s capabilities into day-to-day development.\n> >\n> Chris Audie, SVP Product Management, HashiCorp (an IBM Company)\n\n> >\n> By bringing the Dynatrace MCP server to the GitHub MCP Registry, developers get AI-powered observability, security, and performance insights right at their fingertips—so teams can deliver faster, more resilient, and more robust software with less context switching and reduced cognitive load. We’ve seen rapid adoption across our own engineering organization because the integrated agentic AI experience helps our developers to ship faster and with more confidence—all without leaving their IDEs.\n> >\n> Bonifaz Kaufmann, VP Product, Dynatrace\n\nWe’re also excited to include the Remote GitHub MCP Server, [which recently launched in general availability](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-04-remote-github-mcp-server-is-now-generally-available/). It allows agents to connect with the rich context found in GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests — unlocking deeper, multi-step agentic workflows. Its inclusion in the registry reinforces our commitment to open interoperability and gives developers a trusted way to integrate GitHub context into any MCP-compatible tool.\n\n## Building an open ecosystem together\n\nThe launch of the GitHub MCP Registry is just the beginning. We’re working closely with Anthropic and the MCP Steering Committee to build an open-source MCP registry that integrates seamlessly with GitHub’s. Together with the broader community, we’re shaping the open standard and contribution model for MCP.\n\nDevelopers will be able to self-publish MCP servers directly to the [OSS MCP Community Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/). Once published, those servers will automatically appear in the GitHub MCP Registry, creating a unified, scalable path for discovery.\n\nThis publication flow will:\n\n- Reduce duplication across registries\n- Surface transparent metadata and verification signals\n- Enable contribution at scale across the ecosystem\n\nThe result is a healthier, more open ecosystem — one that leads with quality and accelerates innovation.\n\n## The road ahead\n\nTogether with the open source community, Anthropic, and the MCP Steering Committee, we’re building an open ecosystem where discovering the right AI capability is as simple as searching GitHub. The GitHub MCP Registry is your fastest path from idea to integration, and the foundation for a healthier, more interoperable AI toolchain.\n\n**Ready to explore?** [Browse the GitHub MCP Registry](http://github.com/mcp?utm_source=blog-source&amp;utm_campaign=mcp-registry-server-launch-2025) to discover curated MCP servers from across the ecosystem. You can also contribute to the [OSS MCP Community Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/) and help shape the future of open agentic workflows. Let’s build the future of AI tooling together!",
