This update keeps the menu focused on the options that matter most for your workflow.\n\n![Before-and-after view of GitHub&rsquo;s profile dropdown menu showing a redesign](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab3342a4-4c40-4a04-94b6-d425fe5bb219)\n\n### ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s new\n\n- The profile menu now puts relevant actions front and center, like viewing your profile, repositories, and enterprises.\n- You can set your status and use [single sign-on (SSO)](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-07-single-sign-on-banners-consolidated-across-github/) directly from the top of the menu.\n- Quick links for appearance and accessibility settings are now easier to find so you can personalize your experience.\n- Weâ€™ve removed links that arenâ€™t tied to user actions so the menu is easier to scan and use.\n\n### ðŸ’¬ How to provide feedback\n\nWe want to know what you think. Join the [community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/172081) to share your thoughts or ask questions about the new profile menu.",
