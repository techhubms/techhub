It was fast, surprising, and sometimes weird. But it hinted at something bigger: AI could actually *help* you code, not just autocomplete it.\n\nFast forward to today, and AI is part of our daily workflows. From Cursor to Windsurf and Claude Code to Gemini to OpenAI Codex, there‚Äôs no shortage of new tools. And that‚Äôs great. Developers need options.\n\n**But with 20 million-plus developers across IDEs, the command line, and pull requests, GitHub Copilot is the most-used AI tool among developers**, according to [a recent Pragmatic Engineer survey](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-pragmatic-engineer-2025-survey). Devs¬†have used Copilot to accept more than 3 billion code suggestions to date. And every month, Copilot helps deliver millions of code reviews and contribute 1.2 million pull requests, directly inside GitHub.\n\nAnd because GitHub is where your code already lives (plus your pull requests, reviews, and tests), Copilot doesn‚Äôt stop at writing code. It plugs into everything you rely on via the GitHub MCP Server.\n\nWe haven‚Äôt always been the fastest (though [our Changelog may beg to differ](https://github.blog/changelog/?label=copilot)) or the loudest. But we‚Äôve been building Copilot since before ChatGPT existed, and we are focused on one purpose: to help developers turn TODOs into committed code. And while some chase the bleeding edge, we know developers don‚Äôt want their production code balanced on it.\n\nAll that to say: if you tried Copilot early on, things have changed in some pretty big ways.\n\n![A table showing how GitHub Copilot can help you code faster (Agent mode, Coding agent, Next edit suggestions, Latency improvements, Model choice, Copilot CLI), Build at scale (JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity, Custom instructions, GitHub MCP Server, 20M+ developers), and Ship quality (Copilot Autofix, Code review, Improved model reasoning, Security that works, Built-in privacy).](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FeatureList_v6.png?resize=1232%2C2146)\n\n## From autocomplete to actual collaboration üíª\n\nIf 2024 was about showing what‚Äôs possible with AI, 2025 is about making it *practical*. Copilot has quietly grown from a neat autocomplete trick into a multi-modal, multi-model assistant that actually understands your projects and helps you move them forward.\n\nAfter opening up support for multiple models from different providers in 2024,¬† we‚Äôve been shipping new models almost as fast as they drop from OpenAI‚Äôs latest releases to Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.0 Flash.\n\nThis evolution didn‚Äôt happen by accident. Developers told us what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and that they wanted more powerful agentic workflows and multi-file editing. So we made that happen.\n\nAnd that‚Äôs just one part of how far Copilot‚Äôs come. It‚Äôs all part of a bigger goal: making Copilot smarter without you ever needing to install or configure a thing.\n\n## From idea to merge in record time ‚ö°\n\nOver the last year, raw speed and agentic workflows helped define a new crop of AI tools. We took that as a challenge.\n\n- [**Agent mode**](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/agent-mode-101-all-about-github-copilots-powerful-mode/)**:** Copilot now takes on cross-file tasks, runs commands, refactors entire modules, and suggests terminal operations‚Äîall without leaving your editor.\n- [**Coding agent**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent)**:** Assign an issue to Copilot, and it drafts a pull request with code, tests, and context from your project. Coding agent now contributes to roughly 1.2 million pull requests per month.\n- [**Next-edit suggestions**](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-06-next-edit-suggestions-agent-mode-and-prompts-files-for-github-copilot-in-vs-code-january-release-v0-24/)**:** Copilot predicts the next change you‚Äôll make and offers it inline. One Tab and you‚Äôre done.\n- **Low-latency completions:** Most Copilot responses now render in under **400 ms** (fast enough that you stop noticing them).\n- [**Copilot CLI**](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli?utm_source=blog-cli-cta-oct-2025&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-generic-promotion-blog-launch-oct-2025)**:** The same brains, now in your terminal. Setup, debug, and script without switching windows.\n- [**Multi-model routing**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison#recommended-models-by-task)**:** Different jobs call for different brains. Copilot gives you access to multiple LLMs from leading frontier AI firms.\n\nThe result: fewer interruptions, faster loops, and a workflow that finally keeps pace with how you think.\n\n## AI that scales with your workflow üìê\n\nCopilot doesn‚Äôt live in a new environment you need to learn. It‚Äôs part of the same ecosystem you already use, and scales with it.\n\n- [**JetBrains + VS Code + CLI parity**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/features)**:** Same Copilot, wherever you build.\n- [**Custom instructions**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions)**:** Drop a .copilot-instructions.md file in to teach Copilot your naming conventions, test frameworks, comment formats.\n- [**GitHub MCP Server**](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server?utm_source=blog-mcp-server-cla-oct-2025&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-generic-promotion-blog-launch-oct-2025)**:** Lets any AI tool securely access your GitHub context (pull requests, issues, actions) without leaving GitHub.\n- [**Workspace prompt files**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files)**:** Reusable blueprints for consistent prompts across teams.\n- **20M+ developers strong:** Every Copilot update compounds through the world‚Äôs largest network of real developer data (and feedback).\n\nCopilot isn‚Äôt a separate tool you ‚Äúadd‚Äù to GitHub. It‚Äôs part of what makes GitHub a full-stack development platform. Other tools might help you code; Copilot helps you build, test, secure, and ship.\n\n## Smarter, cleaner, and safer code üîç\n\nFast is nice. Correct is better (ask us how we know). We‚Äôve spent a lot of cycles quietly leveling up Copilot‚Äôs overall code quality and security guardrails where they matter most to you.\n\n- [**Copilot Autofix**](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/responsible-use-autofix-code-scanning)**:** Detects and patches vulnerabilities automatically (it was used to fix over a million vulnerabilities this year alone).\n- [**Code review**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/request-a-code-review/use-code-review)**:** Summarizes diffs, flags logic bugs, and suggests fixes right inside your pull requests with a tool that powers millions of code reviews a month on GitHub.\n- **Improved model reasoning:** Generates more readable, test-passing code with fewer lint errors and less regressions.\n- **CodeQL integration:** Integrations with [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security), [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/copilot-chat-cookbook/analyze-security/manage-dependency-updates), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/from-chaos-to-clarity-using-github-copilot-agents-to-improve-developer-workflows/) keeps your supply chain solid.\n- [**Built-in privacy**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-content-exclusion)**:** Enterprise isolation, audit logs, and tenant-level control mean your work stays off the grid.\n\nOur research shows new code written with Copilot tends to have higher readability, better reliability, and improved maintainability scores.\n\nHere‚Äôs the good news: Copilot‚Äôs backed by the same security stack that protects the world‚Äôs largest open source ecosystem and more than 90% of Fortune 100 companies.\n\n![A table demonstrating GitHub Copilot's leap forward from 2024 to 2025: Single model to Multi-model support, Single-file edits to Agent mode with multi-file reasoning, Basic completions to Next-edit suggestions and inline task automation, Chat in VS Code to IDE + JetBrains + CLI, Limited customization to Project-level instructions &amp; workspace prompts, Text only to Image, diagram, and UI inputs, Early security hints to Copilot Autofix &amp; deeper security integrations, and Competitive lag to 400ms responses &amp; GitHub MCP Server.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LeapForward_v5.png?resize=1232%2C2104)\n\n## Real talk: Copilot vs. the rest üëÄ\n\nLet‚Äôs be honest: there are some great tools out there that make agentic coding workflows feel intuitive and bring real polish to multi-file editing.\n\nCopilot lives in GitHub. That means it‚Äôs close to everything else you do, whether it‚Äôs your pull requests, GitHub Actions workflows, or CI/CD pipelines. Every day, GitHub powers over **3 million pull request merges** and **50 million actions runs**. And Copilot lives in that flow.\n\nOther tools might help you write code faster. But Copilot helps you ship better software.\n\nThat means:\n\n- **No migration, no new IDE, no new habits:** Copilot lives inside the tools you already use.\n- **Full-stack awareness:** Your pull requests, reviews, tests, and workflows are part of the same conversation.\n- **End-to-end coverage:** Copilot brings AI assistance to real-world delivery.\n\n## What‚Äôs next üöÄ\n\nWe‚Äôre just getting started.\n\nAt the end of this month, **GitHub Universe 2025** kicks off, and you can expect a *lot* of news. From smarter agent workflows to deeper multi-model integration and next-gen security features, we‚Äôre building what‚Äôs next for how software gets built.\n\nBecause our goal hasn‚Äôt changed. We‚Äôre here to help every developer commit code faster instead of chasing TODOs.\n\n**Ready to see how far we‚Äôve come?** Get started with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?utm_source=blog-generic-copilot-cta-oct-2025&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-generic-promotion-blog-launch-oct-2025) &gt;",
