  "EnhancedContent": "Enterprise owners can now create a set of custom organization roles that are available across all their organizations. The core set of roles you use in your day-to-day work can be standardized across your enterprise, supporting compliance requirements and making movement across organizations more consistent.\n\nThese roles can be edited only by the enterprise owner and can be assigned by the organization owner in the organization settings or through the [organization role assignment API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/orgs/organization-roles#assign-an-organization-role-to-a-team). Enterprise and organization owners use the same set of organization and repository permissions to create a role, and there are no functional differences between roles created at the enterprise level versus the organization level.\n\nEnterprise, organization, and repository rulesets will be adding support for these roles in the future. This will empower organization owners to control the bypass of enterprise rulesets in their organization by managing the assignment of the organization role.\n\nAs part of this release, we’ve increased the number of custom roles that can be created to 20 per account and role type. This means an enterprise account can create 20 custom organization roles and the organizations in the enterprise can also create up to 20 custom organization roles, allowing an organization owner to have access to up to 40 custom organization roles as well as the pre-defined roles included by default.\n\nThis feature is in public preview and will be included in GHES 3.19 along with the role limit update. For more information about managing organization roles in your enterprise, see our [enterprise documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise).\n\nShare your feedback and thoughts in the [GitHub Community Enterprise forum](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/enterprise).\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
