  "EnhancedContent": "Dependabot update jobs can now target specific self-hosted and larger GitHub-hosted Actions runners using custom labels. Previously, Dependabot required the single `dependabot` label. This change gives you finer control, improves governance in environments restricted to one label (such as some Kubernetes-based runner controllers), and lets you segment workloads for security or performance, by defining custom labels for runners set at the Organization level.\n\nWhat’s new:\n\n– Use any custom label (not just `dependabot` ) to route Dependabot jobs to matching self-hosted and larger GitHub-hosted runners\n\n– Optionally scope runners by runner group name for more granular control\n\n– Reduced operational friction in setups that previously had to dedicate a runner solely to the fixed `dependabot` label\n\n– Keep using the default `dependabot` label if you prefer; no change required if you don’t need custom targeting\n\nExisting workflows that rely on the `dependabot` label will continue to work without changes. **If a specified label has no online runners, Dependabot queues the job until a matching runner becomes available**. Ensure labels are spelled correctly to avoid configuration errors.\n\nCheck out the docs to learn more about [using custom labels with self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/apply-labels) and [managing Dependabot on self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/maintain-dependencies/managing-dependabot-on-self-hosted-runners).\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
