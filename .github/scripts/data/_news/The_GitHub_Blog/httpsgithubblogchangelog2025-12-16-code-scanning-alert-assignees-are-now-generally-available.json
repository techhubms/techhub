The text describes in detail the error that was found, as well as the steps required to remediate the issue. On the right-hand side, a box highlights the Assignees section, where Copilot has been assigned](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca39933d-7cf5-4248-b06d-94a1cf621734)\n\n### Getting started with code scanning alert assignees\n\nFrom the alert detail page, any code scanning alert can now be assigned to users who have `write` access to the repository in which the alert was identified. Assigning users to code scanning alerts brings security work into the same workflow developers already use for issues and pull requests. With assignees, teams can:\n\n- **Take clear ownership** of specific vulnerabilities.\n- **Track remediation work** directly within GitHub.\n- **Accelerate fixes** by making responsibility visible and actionable.\n\nCode scanning alert assignees are available to customers with GitHub Code Security or GitHub Advanced Security on github.com and will be available for GitHub Enterprise Server customers from version 3.20.\n\nLearn more about [managing code scanning alerts](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository) and [assigning alerts](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/managing-code-scanning-alerts/about-code-scanning-alerts#about-alert-assignment).",
