  "EnhancedContent": "[Raycast](https://raycast.com) is a powerful free launcher for macOS. It can launch apps, search files, control your system, and leverage community-built extensions. Now, it can also interact with AI agents.\n\nWith the new [GitHub Copilot extension for Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/github/github-copilot), you can hand tasks to Copilot coding agent and track progress from anywhere on your Mac.\n\nTo start a new task, open Raycast with Command+Space, then find and select the **Create Task** command. From there, pick the repository and enter your prompt, then hit Command+Return. Copilot will create a draft pull request, work in the background, and then tag you for review when ready.\n\n![The Create Task command from the GitHub Copilot Raycast extension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82f59f38-3be6-4f95-a4f7-545fe5931365)\n\nYou can also track running Copilot tasks from Raycast, whether you started them from Raycast, the [agents panel on every page on GitHub](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/agents-panel-launch-copilot-coding-agent-tasks-anywhere-on-github/), or an issue. To monitor your tasks, open Raycast and select the **View Tasks** command.\n\n![The View Tasks command from the GitHub Copilot Raycast extension](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e2858a-e5bd-428c-a4fe-bf2543dbcaed)\n\n### Learn more about Copilot coding agent\n\nCopilot coding agent and the Raycast extension are available in public preview for all users with Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+, as well as Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise users where an administrator has [enabled the relevant policy](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/enabling-copilot-coding-agent).\n\nTo learn more about Copilot coding agent, head to [our documentation](https://gh.io/coding-agent-docs).\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
