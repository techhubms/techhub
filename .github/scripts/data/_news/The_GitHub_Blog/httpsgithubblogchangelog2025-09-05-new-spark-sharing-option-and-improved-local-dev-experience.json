Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new.\n\n### ‚ú® Features\n\n- **Organization sharing:** You can now share sparks with a specific GitHub organization to keep your sparks secure while making collaboration with teammates easier. Pick your organization from the Publish modal to give all users of that organization access to your spark.\n\n![Screenshot of the &lsquo;Publish&rsquo; modal in GitHub Spark, showing the option to securely share a spark with your organization. This makes it easy for all organization members to access and collaborate on your spark, while keeping everything safe and protected.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f18b263d-bcf2-43df-9109-536b1b5e7484)\n- **Improved local development experience:** Create a repository for your spark, open it in a Codespace, and run `npm run dev`\nto expand on your spark.\n- **Better visibility into deployments:** We now clearly show which version of your spark is deployed and indicate when you‚Äôve iterated past your deployed state.\n- **Improved link displays in Discord:** Sharing spark links on Discord now automatically display a branded preview of your app, making it easier for others to see what you‚Äôre sharing.\n- **IME language support in text input fields:** Users leveraging IME-based languages (e.g., Japanese, Chinese) can now iterate more easily in GitHub Spark without premature field submission.\n- **More obvious reverts:** We added a **Restore** button in the iterate panel to make the ability to revert to previous versions more obvious and visible.\n\n### üêû Notable fixes\n\n- We fixed flickering in the Data Panel during high-rate Spark KV store interactions.\n- `*.pid`\nfiles from background processes no longer appear as manual edits in the iteration panel.\n\nStay tuned for more updates, and keep sparking new ideas! ‚ú®\n\n### Try out these improvements today\n\nVisit [github.com/spark](https://github.com/spark) to build your next app.",
