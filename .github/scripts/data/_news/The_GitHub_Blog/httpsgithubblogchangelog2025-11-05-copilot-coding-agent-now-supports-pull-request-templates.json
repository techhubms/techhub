  "EnhancedContent": "Copilot coding agent is our asynchronous, autonomous background agent. When Copilot coding agent finishes its work, it updates the body of its pull request with a summary of changes. Now, Copilot can follow the repository’s pull request template when writing the body.\n\nCreate a [pull request template](https://docs.github.com/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository) by adding a file called `pull_request_template.md` to your repository. If your repository includes multiple pull request templates, Copilot will pick the one best suited to the task.\n\nTo learn more about best practices while using coding agent, visit [our coding agent documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent)."
