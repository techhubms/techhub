  "EnhancedContent": "| *Editor‚Äôs note: This piece was originally published in our LinkedIn newsletter, Branching Out\\_ (this GitHub Blog version adds more detail).* [*Sign up for the newsletter for more career-focused content &gt;*](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/branching-out-6958196028076429312/) | | --- |\n\n**The shift:** Robots are coming for your boilerplate code. In fact, [AI is on track to write 95% of code within the next 5 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-cto-ai-generated-code-software-developer-job-change-2025-4).\n\n**The opportunity:** Robots are terrible at [creativity, collaboration, and big-picture thinking](https://www.axios.com/2025/06/18/ai-chatgpt-research-creativity-brainstorming). Which, conveniently, is where the future of development is headed.\n\nWe‚Äôre entering a new AI-powered era. And the impact is massive: GitHub research projects that by 2030, AI-driven productivity gains could [add the equivalent of 15 million more effective developers to the global workforce](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/), unlocking more than $1.5 trillion in economic value.\n\nKnowing how to code will still be important, but your main job as developer will be that of orchestrator, strategist, and collaborator. Your value won‚Äôt just hinge on typing speed, but increasingly on your ability to solve, design, and inspire. And while the job market is shifting and opportunities can feel uncertain, these are the kinds of skills that can help you stay resilient and stand out.\n\n‚ÄúDevelopers‚Äô roles are evolving from manual coders to orchestrators of AI-driven development ecosystems,‚Äù says[Ketai Qiu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ketai-qiu/?originalSubdomain=ch), co-author of[*From today‚Äôs code to tomorrow‚Äôs symphony: The AI transformation of developer‚Äôs routine by 2030*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12731). ‚ÄúThe future of programming will be less about writing lines of code and more about defining intent, guiding AI systems, and integrating their outputs into coherent solutions.‚Äù\n\nSo what does this shift mean for you, and how can you start building these new skills into your workflow today? Let‚Äôs dive in:\n\n## Skill #1: Make AI coding more reliable by providing better context\n\nAI is fast, but it isn‚Äôt psychic. It can produce code in seconds, yet without understanding what you‚Äôre actually building, the results can feel vague or off-target. That‚Äôs where context comes in. By giving Copilot the right signals‚Äîyour intent, your data, and the purpose behind a task‚Äîyou steer its suggestions toward meaningful, useful output.\n\nEnter [GitHub Copilot Spaces](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-copilot-spaces/create-copilot-spaces)**:** a dedicated environment where you and your team can shape Copilot‚Äôs responses with the context that matters most. Spaces let you upload sources (files, repositories, instructions), set intent, and collaborate so Copilot‚Äôs answers are accurate, relevant, and tailored to your work. Instead of getting one-size-fits-all suggestions, you get outputs designed for your actual codebase, team practices, and business goals.\n\n‚úÖ Here‚Äôs how to set up a GitHub Space:\n\n**Step 1**: Go to[github.com/copilot/spaces](http://github.com/copilot/spaces) and create a new space.\n\n**Step 2**: Upload context, anything from documentation and sample files to entire repositories.\n\n**Step 3**: Start a chat: ask Copilot questions that draw on the sources you‚Äôve added. For example, if you simply ask ‚ÄúGenerate a SQL query to find active users,‚Äù Copilot will guess. If you‚Äôve already shared your schema, the query it produces will be tuned to your actual tables and fields.\n\n| üí° **Tip:** Teams can open organization-wide spaces so everyone benefits from the same shared context instead of working in silos. | | --- |\n\nMastering context won‚Äôt solve every challenge, but it signals that you know how to direct AI systems, which is an increasingly valued ability in modern development.\n\nüé§ This focus on context isn‚Äôt just theory. It‚Äôs actually front and center at GitHub Universe 2025 (October 28‚Äì29 in San Francisco and online) this year. Join us at the conference to explore:\n\n- **Dawn of the agents: Leveraging AI-powered tools to accelerate software development**: In this session, see how intent and context drive better outcomes.\n- **From intent to output: Designing with AI agents**: Explore how developers are guiding Copilot from single prompts into orchestrated solutions.\n\n[![Slide titled 'Dawn of the agents: Leveraging AI-powered tools to accelerate software development' with headshots of Maya Ross and Nick Liffen from GitHub.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image1.png?resize=1024%2C538)](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=developerrole)\n\n[Explore the full Universe agenda](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=developerrole) üëâ\n\n## Skill #2: Provide insight, judgment, and strategy\n\nAI can generate code, but it can‚Äôt replace human insight, creativity, or collaboration. The developers who thrive will be those who blend machine efficiency with human judgment and teamwork. Orchestration will be a primary competitive advantage.\n\nThat‚Äôs where[GitHub Copilot code review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/request-a-code-review/use-code-review) comes in, an AI tool that scans pull requests, highlights issues, and suggests improvements automatically, helping teams ship faster with fewer bottlenecks.\n\n‚úÖ Try it today:\n\n**Step 1**: Request a Copilot review: open an existing pull request and add Copilot as a reviewer.\n\n**Step 2**: Review Copilot‚Äôs feedback: after a moment, it will add comments, suggestions, and inline changes you can commit directly.\n\n**Step 3**: Refine the review: re-review, thumbs-up/down feedback, or add a [.github/copilot-instructions.md](http://copilot-instructions.md/) file for custom rules.\n\n| üí° **Tip:** Once Copilot provides feedback, you can enable automatic reviews so it checks every pull request by default. Don‚Äôt worry, Copilot won‚Äôt block merges unless you decide to. | | --- |\n\nüé§ And if you want to see how global teams are already scaling collaboration with Copilot, you‚Äôll find it at Universe. Join us to attend sessions like:\n\n- **From pair to peer: The next evolution of Copilot code review**: In this session, learn how global teams are using Copilot code review to speed delivery and reduce bottlenecks.\n- **Hackable badges.** A fan favorite returns. Every in-person attendee gets a programmable badge to code, customize, and showcase, sparking collaboration, creativity, and connection.\n- Plus: **GitHub Expert Center**, **Career Corner**, and **Open Source Zone**: where hallway conversations turn into lasting collaborations.\n\n[![Conference slide titled &lsquo;From pair to peer: The next evolution of Copilot code review.&rsquo; Includes GitHub Universe 2025 logo on the left, speaker photo of Elle Shwer with GitHub listed as affiliation.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image2.png?resize=1024%2C538)](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=developerrole)\n\n[Plan your Universe experience](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/explore/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=developerrole) üëâ\n\n## Skill #3: Recognize that learning is never done\n\nThe half-life of technical skills has always been a reality. But in an AI-powered world, it‚Äôs getting shorter. What you know today won‚Äôt be enough tomorrow, which is why continuous learning is the key to staying ahead.\n\n‚úÖ Here‚Äôs a practical roadmap to grow your AI skill set right inside GitHub (adapted from our blog,[*Vibe coding: Your roadmap to becoming an AI developer*](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/vibe-coding-your-roadmap-to-becoming-an-ai-developer/)):\n\n**Step 1**: Learn essential languages and frameworks: start with Python, then expand into Java and C++. Explore frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.\n\n**Step 2**: Master machine learning basics: deep learning, NLP, and computer vision. Try open source repositories like[Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning), NLTK, or OpenCV.\n\n**Step 3**: Showcase your skills on GitHub: organize your repository, publish READMEs,[contribute to open source](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github), and[build a standout profile on GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).\n\n**Step 4**:[Get certified in GitHub Copilot](https://learn.github.com/certification/COPILOT): learn the full toolkit, prepare with docs and projects, and earn your Copilot certification badge.\n\n| üí° **Tip:** Don‚Äôt just learn AI skills in isolation, show your work. Every repository, contribution, or badge signals to employers that you‚Äôre keeping pace with the AI era. | | --- |\n\nContinuous learning can‚Äôt eliminate uncertainty in a shifting job market. But it gives you the best shot at adapting, whether that means advancing in your current role or pivoting into adjacent paths like developer advocacy, architecture, or tooling.\n\nüé§ Staying ahead means investing in continuous learning. And at Universe, you‚Äôll hear directly from the leaders shaping how software gets built. Highlights include:\n\n- **Leading with GitHub Copilot: Rethinking experience, strategy, and collaboration**: Presented by[Sharanya Doddapaneni, VP of Engineering at GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanyad/), this session explores how AI is reshaping engineering leadership.\n- **Flying high with AI: Cathay Pacific on transforming software developmen**t: Hear how[Rajeev Nair, general manager of IT Infrastructure and security](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeevk2/), is scaling security and modernizing development at one of the world‚Äôs leading airlines.\n- Plus, sessions from leaders at **GitHub**, **HubSpot**, **Microsoft**, and **GM** on pushing AI-powered workflows forward.\n\n[![Conference slide titled &lsquo;Flying high with AI: Cathay Pacific on transforming software.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image3.png?resize=1024%2C538)](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=developerrole)\n\n[See the full speaker lineup](https://reg.githubuniverse.com/flow/github/universe25/attendee-portal/page/speakers/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=GitHub&amp;utm_campaign=developerrole) üëâ\n\n## We‚Äôre all in this together\n\nJoin us at Universe, where context, collaboration, and creativity come together.
