Today, we’re launching **two new premium request SKUs** for GitHub Copilot coding agent and GitHub Spark, plus new bundled budget options that make cost management simple and predictable.\n\n## Granular visibility meets flexible control\n\n**Dedicated SKUs for crystal-clear attribution**\n\nGitHub Copilot coding agent and GitHub Spark now have their own premium request SKUs. The existing Copilot Premium Request SKU will continue to track usage for all other tools that consume premium requests.\n\n**Choose your premium request budget strategy**\n\nWhether you prefer granular control or streamlined management, we’ve got you covered:\n\n- **Product-specific budgets:** Set separate budgets down to the SKU level to define different spending limits for each AI tool.\n- **Bundled budget:** Manage spending for all premium request SKUs within one unified budget. This is perfect for teams who want simplicity without losing oversight.\n\nLearn more about [setting up budgets](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/tutorials/set-up-budgets).\n\n**Enhanced policy controls (Enterprise and Team plans only)**\n\nNew premium request overage policy options let enterprise and team administrators enable or disable overages per tool. Want to allow overages for coding agent but not Spark? Configure it in seconds within your Copilot policies.\n\nLearn more about [configuring your premium request policies](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/manage-request-allowances#setting-a-policy-for-paid-usage).\n\n**No disruption to budgets you already configured**\n\nExisting premium request budgets automatically migrate to our new bundled budget system. This ensures your already-configured cost protections remain intact.\n\n**Enterprise and Team plans: If you have a $0 premium request budget, it will be removed on November 18th. For more information, see [our changelog about this removal](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-17-upcoming-removal-of-copilot-premium-request-0-budgets-for-enterprise-and-team-accounts/).**\n\n## Why this matters\n\n- **For budget-conscious teams:** Stop guessing about which AI tools are driving usage.\n- **For scaling organizations:** Expand AI adoption with confidence and the granular spending controls you need.\n- **For building a foundation for growth:** Enable sophisticated AI governance as GitHub’s AI ecosystem continues to grow.\n\n## What you need to know\n\n- **Historical data remains unchanged:** Usage for Spark and coding agent prior to this release will remain under the Copilot Premium Requests SKU. All new usage moving forward will be properly attributed to the correct SKU.\n- **Pro/Pro+ $0 budgets continue:** Pro and Pro+ users will continue to manage their spending with $0 budgets. Premium request overage policy is currently only available for GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise accounts.\n- **Bundled budgets are future-ready:** As we introduce new tools that use premium requests, they’ll be automatically added to your bundled budget so you don’t have to worry about surprise charges.\n\nJoin us on [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations) to share your feedback or ask questions about these new features.",
