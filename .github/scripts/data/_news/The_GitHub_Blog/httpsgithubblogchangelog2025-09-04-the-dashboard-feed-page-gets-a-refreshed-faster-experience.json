  "EnhancedContent": "We’ve updated the /dashboard-feed page on GitHub.com to align with improvements to the homepage “For you” feed, bringing a more consistent and performant experience across GitHub.\n\n### What’s new\n\n- **Faster, more up-to-date events**: The dashboard feed page now uses our newer feeds infrastructure, improving freshness and reliability.\n- **A refreshed look and feel**: Events display in the same modern, readable card layout as the “For you” feed.\n- **More event types**: You’ll see expanded event coverage including announcements, releases, and sponsors activity.\n- **Gentle recommendations you can tune**: When recommendations appear, select **See less activity like this** to help refine what you see.\n\n### What remains the same\n\n- **No filters**: The dashboard feed page doesn’t include the filtering controls available in the “For you” feed.\n- **Chronological ordering**: Events appear newest to oldest, consistent with the February 14, 2025 [“For you” feed update](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-02-14-reverting-feed-activity-sorting-back-to-chronological-ordering).\n- **Same location**: Access your dashboard feed page at [github.com/dashboard-feed](https://github.com/dashboard-feed).\n\n### Why this changed\n\nMoving to our latest infrastructure improves event freshness and creates a more consistent GitHub experience. This update also paves the way for continued performance improvements.\n\n### Availability\n\nThis change is gradually rolling out following publication of this post.\n\n### Share your feedback\n\nTell us what you think and how we can improve the dashboard feed page by [opening a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions) in the GitHub Community.",
