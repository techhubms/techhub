We’re here to give you our top tips for finding the perfect gift for them. (Or just for you, you know you deserve it.)\n\n![A model wears a GitHub-themed holiday beanie.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hat.png?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## From vibe code to holiday mode\n\nMove straight from shipping code to holiday mode with the [ugly holiday socks](https://thegithubshop.com/products/ugly-holiday-socks?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list) and [beanie](https://thegithubshop.com/products/ugly-holiday-beanie?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list). Made with 49% merino wool, the socks keep your feet warm, while the 100% wool beanie handles the rest. Pair them with the [ugly sweater](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/shop-all/products/1550192-ugly-sweater-v-2024?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list) to finish the look.\n\n🎁 And they’re all included in our [Black Friday sale](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/sale?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list)—so grab them before they’re gone.\n\n![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0306.jpg?resize=1024%2C566)\n\n## The answer to life’s biggest questions\n\n“Should I push to prod on New Year’s Eve?”\n\n“Should I eat more of my favorite holiday dish?”\n\n“Should I create another side project in 2026?”\n\nThe [GitHub Copilot Amazeball](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/github-copilot-amazeball?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list) will have the answer for these questions, and many, many more. It’ll get you on your path. Is it the right path? We don’t have the answer for that.\n\n![An Asobu bottle with a GitHub logo.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/asobu.png?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## Stay hydrated (and caffeinated)\n\nA good day starts with a coffee, right? We’ve got the solution to all your hot beverage needs, whether you’re on the go with our [Invertocat orb bottle](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/invertocat-orb-bottle), at your desk with our “[Ship It” diner mug](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/1548074-00-ship-it-diner-mug)(on sale now) or deep in the forest with our [Invertocat MiiR camp mug](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/invertocat-miir-camp-mug) (also works on the school run).\n\nAnd, of course, staying hydrated is important too, and nothing will help you more than our [Stanley cup](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/gh-0016-invertocat-stanley-tumbler?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list) or [Invertocat Asobu Marina tumbler](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/1543072-00-invertocat-asobu-marina-tumbler?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list) (which also has a coffee cup built in, just saying). Get them both in our [Black Friday sale](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/sale?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list).\n\n![A GitHub MiiR backpack.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/backpack.png?resize=1024%2C683)\n\n## Level up your workspace\n\nHave you seen our [latest key caps](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/key-caps-2-0-assorted-pack-of-4)? They may not help you ship code faster, but they do look great. They’re an easy office gift or the perfect extra touch for a holiday present.\n\nThe [recycled desk mat](https://thegithubshop.com/products/1540443-00-recycled-desk-mat) helps your mouse glide smoothly across your workspace. Sophisticated and sleek… well, not exactly. This desk mat is loud, proud, and unmistakably GitHub—with Octocats from edge to edge.\n\nA fan favorite on social media, our [MiiR backpack](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/lifestyle/products/1547139-00-invertocat-miir-c2-ae-laptop-backpack) is here to get you to the office, to the plane and everywhere in between. A holiday must-have.\n\n![A youth model wears a green GitHub sweatshirt.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/youth-hoodie.jpg?resize=1024%2C682)\n\n## For future builders\n\nEncourage curiosity early. For the little builders in your life, we have our very cosy [youth ASCII Invertocat pullover](https://thegithubshop.com/products/youth-ascii-invertocat-pullover-hoodie?pr_prod_strat=jac&amp;pr_rec_id=d80962eb7&amp;pr_rec_pid=8418613624920&amp;pr_ref_pid=8418581971032&amp;pr_seq=uniform), along with our [ASCII Invertocat tee](https://thegithubshop.com/products/youth-ascii-invertocat-tee). Want to do some holiday matching? We have the ASCII Cube tee in both [youth](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/apparel/products/youth-ascii-cube-tee) and [adult](https://thegithubshop.com/products/ascii-cube-tee) sizes.\n\n![An 'ugly holiday sweater' featuring GitHub, Mona the Octocat, and Copilot.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sweater.jpg?resize=1024%2C682)\n\n## Take advantage of our Black Friday sale\n\nGiving the perfect gift feels great. Getting it at a solid discount feels even better. From November 26 to December 7, our Black Friday sale offers markdowns on some of these picks and plenty more across the shop. See [everything on sale](https://thegithubshop.com/collections/sale?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=holiday_list), and check our [holiday order deadlines](https://thegithubshop.com/pages/shopping-info#shipping) to ensure your gifts arrive on time.\n\nFrom all of us at the GitHub Shop: here’s to a December packed with good gifts, good energy, and the occasional sprint to finish that last bit of code.
