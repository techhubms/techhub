  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub is committed to empowering the developer community by helping organizations recognize and address the risks of secret leaks. That’s why we’re launching a new free tool which will help provide clear insights into your organization’s exposure, along with actionable steps to strengthen your security and protect your code.\n\nWith the secret risk assessment feature, you can scan your organization for aggregate insights on public leaks, private exposures, and token types. In addition, you can now estimate potential return on investment with secret scanning push protection based on secrets found.\n\n![Find secrets in your organization with the secret risk assessment](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b15ead-bf76-4a67-9cd6-ba761f2a6a2e)\n\n### What does the risk assessment dashboard include?\n\nAvailable in the **Security** tab, organization and security admins will be able to run a scan to understand how their organization is affected by secret leaks and exposures. Once a scan is initiated, GitHub will look for secret leaks and exposures across your organization, returning a collection of insights including:\n\n- The number of secrets leaked per type.\n- The number of publicly visible secrets in your public repositories.\n- The number of repositories affected for each secret type.\n\nNo specific secrets will be stored or shared.\n\nOnce enabled, GitHub will run a point-in-time scan across all public, private, internal, and archived repositories in your organization. Results are static and will not be automatically updated. You’ll also be able to download results as a CSV file and can re-run the scan once every 90 days.\n\nFor organizations ready to adopt a continuous monitoring tool, we recommend enabling secret scanning for detection and incident management of specific secrets. Learn more about [GitHub Secret Protection](https://github.com/security/advanced-security/secret-protection).\n\n### Why are we doing this?\n\nGitHub is committed to making a meaningful impact on the developer community by helping organizations recognize their secret leak footprint across their GitHub perimeter. Our goal is to provide clear insights into organizations’ potential secret exposure and a clear path to stronger security.\n\n### Who can use this feature?\n\nThis feature will be available for free to organizations with a GitHub Team or Enterprise plan. Organization admins and security managers will be able to run the report and review any results. This feature will be available for Enterprise Server starting with GHES 3.18.",
