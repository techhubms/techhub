  "EnhancedContent": "Copilot code review is now in most standard editors and IDEs! ðŸš€ With this update, you can use Copilot code review directly in Visual Studio and JetBrains IDEs (including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, and more). This adds to existing support in Xcode and Visual Studio Code.\n\nYou can now:\n\n- Request Copilot code review feedback on your code before you open a pull request, from within JetBrains IDEs and Visual Studio.\n- Self-review your changes and get actionable feedback exactly where you write your code.\n- Use Copilot code review to catch logic, security, and performance issues, all within your editor of choice.\n\nNow you can get actionable feedback before others see your code, saving you time in your pull request review process!\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, make sure your Copilot plugin for Visual Studio or JetBrains is up-to-date, stage your changes, and click the Copilot code review button.\n\nDemo of Copilot code review generating review feedback and suggestions in JetBrains IDE\n\nIn Visual Studio, this change updates the existing self-review option (detailed in this [earlier announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/catch-issues-before-you-commit-to-git/)) to Copilot code review.\n\nDemo of Copilot code review generating review feedback and suggestions in Visual Studio\n\n## Questions or feedback?\n\nFor questions about any of these updates, join the conversation in our [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations) discussion. Weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts!",
