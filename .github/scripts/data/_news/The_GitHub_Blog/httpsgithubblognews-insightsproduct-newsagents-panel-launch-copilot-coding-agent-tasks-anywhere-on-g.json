  "EnhancedContent": "If the past year has underscored anything, it‚Äôs that AI agents are becoming a bigger part of developers‚Äô day-to-day workflows.\n\nWe recently launched Copilot coding agent, an asynchronous, autonomous developer agent: it allows you to assign an issue to Copilot, and Copilot will work in the background and create a draft pull request for your review. Copilot coding agent works like a member of your team, and it‚Äôs received a great response from developers so far.\n\nBut we know that not all of your work lives in GitHub Issues.\n\nToday, we‚Äôre launching a new Agents experience on GitHub ‚Äî the Agents panel ‚Äî allowing you to quickly delegate tasks to Copilot from any page on [github.com](http://github.com) with a simple prompt and track Copilot‚Äôs progress without breaking your flow.\n\nAnd of course, Copilot coding agent is also integrated into VS Code, GitHub Mobile, and the GitHub MCP Server, so you can collaborate with Copilot wherever you‚Äôre working.\n\n## Delegate any coding task to Copilot coding agent, wherever you are, with the Agents panel\n\n| *Need a quick refresher on GitHub Copilot coding agent? Skip ahead &gt;* | | --- |\n\nThe Agents panel, available today on every page on github.com, is your mission control center for agentic workflows on GitHub.\n\nIt‚Äôs a **lightweight overlay** that allows you to hand new tasks to Copilot and track existing tasks without navigating away from your current work. Just click the new Agents button in the navigation bar to get started.\n\n![A screenshot of the new Agents panel in GitHub that allows developers to track, manage, and start Copilot coding agent workflows from anywhere on GitHub. This screenshot shows recent tasks that coding agent, an agentic workflow that generates draft pull requests based on requirements set out by a developer, is working on with the option to view all tasks. Developers can also enter a natural language prompt in a box and specify which repository and which branch coding agent should work on.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Agents-panel-with-callout-2.png?resize=1013%2C1024)\n\nFrom the Agents panel, you can:\n\n- üõ†Ô∏è **Assign background tasks** without switching pages.\n- üëÄ **Monitor running tasks** with real-time status.\n- üîó **Jump into pull requests** when you‚Äôre ready to review.\n\nOpen the panel in a full-screen view by clicking **View all tasks**, or bookmark[github.com/copilot/agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents) for direct access.\n\n### Launch new tasks without breaking your flow\n\nYou can start a new Copilot task from the new Agents panel with a simple prompt. Just open the panel from any page on GitHub, describe your goal in natural language, and select the relevant repository. Copilot will then take it from there and start creating a plan, drafting changes, running tests, and then preparing a pull request.\n\nNot sure where to start? Try the following sample prompts:\n\n- **Describe a simple task**:\n- ‚ÄúAdd integration tests for LoginController‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúRefactor WidgetGenerator for better code reuse‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúAdd a dark mode/light mode switcher‚Äù\n- **Refer to a GitHub issue or pull request as context, optionally providing extra context**:\n- ‚ÄúFix #877 using pull request #855 as an example‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúFix #1050, and make sure you update the screenshots in the README‚Äù\n- **Run multiple tasks in parallel:**\n- ‚ÄúAdd unit test coverage for utils.go‚Äù + ‚ÄúAdd unit test coverage for helpers.go‚Äù\n\n## Copilot coding agent: a quick reintroduction\n\nCopilot coding agent lets you hand off coding tasks ‚Äî via GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, VS Code, or any MCP-enabled tool ‚Äî and get back a draft pull request when it‚Äôs done. It runs in the cloud, can work in parallel on multiple tasks, and continues even if your computer is off.\n\nIts secure, GitHub Actions-powered environment can run builds, tests, and linters without asking for every step. You stay in control with detailed logs and pull request-based approvals, and can give feedback by mentioning `@copilot` in a review.\n\nThanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Copilot has read access to your repository data on GitHub (powered by the [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)). It can also view web pages for testing and validation (powered by the Playwright MCP Server), and connect to [your own MCP servers](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-to-build-secure-and-scalable-remote-mcp-servers/), as well. You can [learn more about how it works](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/from-pair-to-peer-programmer-our-vision-for-agentic-workflows-in-github-copilot/) (or [read our Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/coding-agent/coding-agent)), if you‚Äôre curious.\n\n![A screenshot of a pull request generated by GitHub Copilot, an AI coding tool, in a GitHub developer workflow.

The screenshot also shows the developer assigned to review the pull request as well as assignees that include a developer and GitHub Copilot.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CleanShot-2025-08-14-at-16.51.35.png?resize=1024%2C368) ![A screenshot showing an ongoing task that GitHub Copilot coding agent, an agentic workflow tool on GitHub, is working on.

Your administrator may need to [enable the Copilot coding agent policy](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-enterprise-policies).\n\n[**Learn more about GitHub Copilot &gt;**](https://github.com/features/copilot)",
