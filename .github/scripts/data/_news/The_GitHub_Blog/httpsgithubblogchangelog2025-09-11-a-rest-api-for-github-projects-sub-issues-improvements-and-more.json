  "EnhancedContent": "You can now use the REST API to understand and manage information about your projects, and take advantage of sub-issue improvements that make it even easier to break down your work.\n\n## ‚öô REST API for GitHub Projects\n\nUsing the REST API, you can:\n\n- List projects and get information about a specific project, its fields, and its items.\n- Add and delete issues and pull requests from a project.\n- Update field values for project items.\n\nCheck out [our documentation on the Projects REST API](https://docs.github.com/rest/projects) for more details.\n\n## ‚ú® Sub-issue improvements\n\n- Sub-issues now **inherit the Project and Milestone** of their parent issue by default.\n- Sub-issues now support **cross-organization** issues, allowing a sub-issue to belong to a different organization than its parent.\n- The REST API now includes an endpoint to **fetch the parent issue** for a given issue. See the [API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/sub-issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-parent-issue) for details.\n\n## üìú Sticky sidebar on issues\n\nWe‚Äôve introduced a sticky sidebar that stays visible as you scroll your issues, making it easier to view and update assignees, labels, types, milestones, and projects while reading long comment threads. No need to scroll back to the top!\n\n## üè∑Ô∏è GitHub for Microsoft Teams app renamed\n\nThe [GitHub for Microsoft Teams app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/wa200002077?tab=overview) has been renamed to GitHub Notifications. This update reflects the app‚Äôs focus on delivering GitHub notifications directly into Teams.\n\nPreviously, you could mention the app in Teams using `@GitHub` . You should now use `@GitHub Notifications` .\n\nAll existing functionality remains the same, and no user action is required.\n\n## ‚úçÔ∏è Tell us what you think!\n\nJoin the conversation within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/projects-and-issues), or select **Give feedback** from the projects **‚Ä¶** menu to share your feedback!\n\nSee how to use GitHub for project planning with [GitHub Issues and Projects](https://github.com/features/issues), check out what‚Äôs on the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1), and learn more in [our GitHub Issues documentation](https://docs.github.com/issues).",
