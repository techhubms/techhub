Check **Enable Copilot Coding Agent (Preview)** from the settings to offload UI cleanups, refactors, doc updates, and multi-file edits while you focus on core development.\n- **Copilot actions in context menu**: Access new Copilot actions right in your context menu! Generate code comments, explanations, or optimizations with a single click.\n- **Intent detection for all-in-one search**: Never lose track of files again with the new “Did you mean” feature. Copilot analyzes your search terms and suggests better matches when it detects typos or fuzzy searches, helping you find what you need faster.\n\n[Download Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) to experience all the new Copilot features today.
