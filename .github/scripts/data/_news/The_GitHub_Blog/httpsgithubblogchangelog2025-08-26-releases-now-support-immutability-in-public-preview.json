With immutable releases, assets and tags are protected from tampering after publication, so the software you publish — and your users consume — remains secure and trustworthy.\n\n### What are immutable releases\n\nImmutable releases offer:\n\n- **Immutable assets**: Once you publish a release as immutable, its assets can’t be added, modified, or deleted. This protects distributed artifacts from supply chain attacks.\n- **Tag protection**: Tags for new immutable releases are protected and can’t be deleted or moved.\n- **Release attestations**: Immutable releases receive signed attestations so you can easily verify the authenticity and integrity of assets, both on GitHub and in external environments.\n\n### How to enable immutable releases\n\nYou can enable immutable releases at the repository or organization level in settings. Once enabled:\n\n- All new releases are immutable (assets are locked, tags are protected).\n- Existing releases remain mutable unless you republish them.\n- Disabling immutability doesn’t affect releases created while it was enabled — they remain immutable.\n\n### Release attestations and verification\n\nRelease attestations let you verify that an artifact is authentic and unchanged, even outside GitHub. You can use the GitHub CLI to validate releases and assets:\n\n```sh gh release verify <tag> gh release verify-asset <tag> <asset>\n\n```\n\nAttestations use the [Sigstore bundle format](https://docs.sigstore.dev/about/bundle/), so you can integrate with Sigstore-compatible tooling and automate policy enforcement in your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nWe’d love your feedback. Share your thoughts and questions on the [GitHub Community](https://gh.io/AAxpck6).\n\nFor more information, see our [immutable releases documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/immutable-releases).\n\n> >\n> We’re gradually rolling out immutable releases to all repositories and organizations.\n> >",
