  "EnhancedContent": "On September 12, 2025, we will retire Copilot text completion for pull request descriptions. After this date, when you start writing a description, Copilot will no longer suggest completions.\n\nThis feature, currently in beta, has helped Copilot Enterprise customers complete their pull request descriptions by offering contextually relevant suggestions. While it’s been valuable for a few developers, we’ve decided to focus our efforts elsewhere. Instead of continuing to invest in this specific experience, we’ll be shipping improvements to pull request summaries that will make it easier for developers to generate clear, accurate, and high-quality summaries.\n\nThese updates give you more meaningful assistance when describing your changes, helping reviewers more quickly understand the scope and intent of your pull requests.\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/pull-requests).
