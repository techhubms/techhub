It has been refined with reinforcement learning to improve suggestion relevance based on your feedback.\n\nThe model will automatically become available to users on all plans. You’ll see it in the [code completion model picker](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/change-the-completion-model). To learn more about working with code completion, see the [code suggestions documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/get-code-suggestions/get-code-suggestions).\n\nLet us know your feedback on the new model in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169496)."
