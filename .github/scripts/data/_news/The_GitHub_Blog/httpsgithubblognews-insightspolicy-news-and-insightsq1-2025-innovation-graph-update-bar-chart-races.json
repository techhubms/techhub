  "EnhancedContent": "We launched the [GitHub Innovation Graph](https://github.blog/tag/innovation-graph/) to give developers, researchers, and policymakers an easy way to explore and analyze global trends in open source software development. It offers a reliable, transparent dataset that tracks public collaboration activity across regions over time.\n\nOur latest quarterly update now includes data through March 2025, which means the Innovation Graph spans more than five years of insights into the global software economy.\n\nData visualization and AI continue to gain momentum, and more broadly, the Innovation Graph is becoming an increasingly valuable resource for anyone looking to ground their work in trusted, real-world developer data.\n\nLet’s jump in.\n\n## Bar chart race videos now available on global metrics pages\n\nWe’ve added bar chart race videos to the [git pushes](https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/git-pushes), [repositories](https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/repositories), [developers](https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/developers), and [organizations](https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/organizations) global metrics pages.\n\n## `data-visualization`\nenters the topics leader board\n\nIn Q1 2025, `data-visualization` finally appeared as one of the [top 50 topics](https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/topics#topic-rankings) by the number of unique pushers:\n\n![Screenshot of a chart that shows that the &ldquo;data-visualization&rdquo; repository topic is at rank 50 in Q1 2025. This is the first and only time it appears on the chart.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/data_visualization_topic.png?resize=1024%2C156)\n\nStarting from way down in rank 100 in Q1 2020, it’s been an arduous journey:\n\n![A line chart that shows the rank of the &ldquo;data-visualization&rdquo; repository topic over time. Its rank rose steadily from rank 100 in Q1 2020 to rank 50 in Q1 2025, with a temporary spike to approximately rank 70 in Q1 2022.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/data_visualization_historical_rank.png?resize=1024%2C368)\n\nNot every repository topic has the kind of trajectory as `ai` :\n\n![A bump chart that shows the rapid rise of the &ldquo;ai&rdquo; repository topic over time, starting at rank 25 in Q3 2023 to rank 8 in Q1 2025.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai_topic.png?resize=518%2C1024)\n\nOr `llm` :\n\n![A bump chart that shows the rapid rise of the &ldquo;llm&rdquo; repository topic over time, starting at rank 24 in Q2 2024 to rank 11 in Q1 2025.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/llm_topic.png?resize=410%2C1024)\n\n## Research roundup\n\nFinally, we’d like to highlight some of the recent research reports and papers that caught our interest — and that utilize GitHub and Innovation Graph data:\n\n### The 2025 AI Index Report\n\nPublished by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI), the [AI Index Report](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report) tracks and monitors trends in AI development and diffusion, synthesizing insights relevant to businesses, policymakers, researchers, and the general public. Check out [Section 1.6](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/research-and-development) of the report for their analysis of public AI-related software projects on GitHub over time, showing a sharp increase in 2024.\n\n- Nestor Maslej, Loredana Fattorini, Raymond Perrault, Yolanda Gil, Vanessa Parli, Njenga Kariuki, Emily Capstick, Anka Reuel, Erik Brynjolfsson, John Etchemendy, Katrina Ligett, Terah Lyons, James Manyika, Juan Carlos Niebles, Yoav Shoham, Russell Wald, Tobi Walsh, Armin Hamrah, Lapo Santarlasci, Julia Betts Lotufo, Alexandra Rome, Andrew Shi, Sukrut Oak. [“The AI Index 2025 Annual Report,”](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report) AI Index Steering Committee, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, April 2025.\n\n### Corporate Accelerators and Global Entrepreneurial Growth\n\nResearchers found that participating in a corporate accelerator program increased startups’ future funding by more than 40%. Innovation Graph data was used as a measure of regional technical labor capacity.\n\n- Impink, Stephen Michael and Wright, Nataliya and Seamans, Robert, Corporate Accelerators and Global Entrepreneurial Growth (June 12, 2025). Columbia Business School Research Paper No. 5291626, HEC Paris Research Paper No. SPE-2025-1572, Available at SSRN: [https://ssrn.com/abstract=5291626](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5291626) or [http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5291626](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5291626).\n\n### The building blocks of software work explain coding careers and language popularity\n\nResearchers analyzed StackOverflow to develop a large-scale, fine-grained taxonomy of software development tasks. They found that in particular, Python developers are more likely to pursue tasks associated with higher wages, possibly because Python’s versatility enables them to more readily pick up skills in disparate and unfamiliar areas. Innovation Graph data provided a way to assess the representativeness of the distribution of programming languages used by StackOverflow users.\n\n- Feng, X., Wachs, J., Daniotti, S. and Neffke, F., 2025. The building blocks of software work explain coding careers and language popularity. arXiv preprint [arXiv:2504.03581](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03581).\n\n### Who is using AI to code? Global diffusion and impact of generative AI\n\nResearchers trained a classifier to detect AI-generated Python functions, finding that AI generated 30% of Python functions committed on GitHub by US developers. This resulted in a 2.4% increase in total quarterly commit volume, which generates an estimated $9.6-14.4 billion in value annually.\n\n- Daniotti, Simone, Johannes Wachs, Xiangnan Feng, and Frank Neffke. “Who is using AI to code? Global diffusion and impact of generative AI.” arXiv preprint [arXiv:2506.08945](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08945) (2025).\n\n### Societal Capacity Assessment Framework: Measuring Advanced AI Implications for Vulnerability, Resilience, and Transformation\n\nResearchers developed an indicators-based approach to assessing societal resilience to advanced AI across three dimensions: structural factors that might predispose a society to AI risks (“vulnerability”); capacity to prevent, absorb, and recover from AI risks (“resilience”); and capacity to leverage AI systems to mitigate AI risks and reconfigure the society toward systemic safety (“transformation”). The Innovation Graph was cited in the prototype framework as a data source to use as a proxy to measure a society’s human capital in the domain of cyber security.\n\n- Milan M.
