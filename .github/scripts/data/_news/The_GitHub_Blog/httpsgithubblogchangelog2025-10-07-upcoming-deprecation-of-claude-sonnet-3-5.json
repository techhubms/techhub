  "EnhancedContent": "We will deprecate Claude Sonnet 3.5 across all GitHub Copilot experiences (including Copilot Chat, inline edits, ask and agent modes, and code completions) on November 6th, 2025.\n\nNewer, more capable models will be introduced to ensure that users on our Copilot Free plan continue to have an improved experience over time.\n\nPlease update your workflows and integrations to use supported models before this date. Copilot Enterprise administrators may need to enable access to alternative models through their model policies in Copilot settings. As an administrator, you can verify availability by checking your individual Copilot settings and confirming that the policy is enabled for a specific model. Once enabled, you’ll see the model in the Copilot Chat model selector in VS Code and on github.com. No action is required to remove the models once they have been deprecated.\n\nGitHub Enterprise customers with questions or concerns are encouraged to reach out to their account manager for further assistance.\n\n### Share your feedback\n\nTo learn more about the models available in Copilot, see [our documentation on models](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models) and get started with Copilot today.\n\nHave feedback or questions?
