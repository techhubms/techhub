Weeks go into specs or mocks that rarely make it to production, and even when they do, they often miss the mark.\n\n[GitHub Spark](https://github.com/spark?utm_source=changelog-source-cta&amp;utm_campaign=spark-launch-sep-2025) changes that by enabling teams to focus on the **what**, not the **how**: validate ideas early with rapid prototypes, get concepts into production that might otherwise stall in the backlog, and collaborate around live applications instead of fragmented docs or mockups.\n\nBuilt directly into the GitHub platform that millions of developers already rely on, Spark offers a streamlined path from prototype to production. Repositories, Dependabot, Codespaces, and Copilot all work together out of the box, so teams can move faster without leaving the tools they trust. Developers, product managers, designers, and other team members can centralize collaboration around interactive prototypes, break down silos, and create internal tools that make everyday work more efficient.\n\n### Key features\n\n- **Natural language to app:** Describe your idea and watch Spark build it, with frontend and backend capabilities included.\n- **No setup required:** Data, LLM inference, hosting, deployments, and GitHub auth all included out of the box.\n- **Add AI to your apps:** Add intelligent features powered by LLMs from OpenAI, Meta, DeepSeek, xAI, and more—no API key management needed.\n- **One-click deployments:** Publish your app with a single click, with various controls to make sharing secure for you and your team.\n- **Build your way:** Use natural language, visual editing controls, or code with GitHub Copilot code completions at your fingertips to iterate on your ideas.\n- **Create a repository:** Get a repository with your favorite functionality included in just a click. Everything stays synchronized so you aren’t trapped in a sandbox.\n- **Expand with Copilot agents:** Open a codespace directly from Spark to iterate with Copilot agent mode or assign an issue to Copilot coding agent.\n\n### Now available for Copilot Enterprise customers\n\nSpark is available today in **public preview** for all **Copilot Enterprise customers**. Spark messages use premium requests included in GitHub Copilot plans.\n\n### How to enable Spark for your organization\n\nBy default, Spark is **disabled**. Enterprise admins can [enable Spark](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-spark) as follows:\n\n1. Navigate to your **Enterprise Policies** tab on github.com.\n2. Select **Copilot** in the left sidebar.\n3. Scroll down to the “Features” section where you will see “Spark”.\n4. Change the Spark policy setting to **Enabled**, which will enable Spark for all Copilot Enterprise users associated with your enterprise. Optionally, you can change the Spark policy setting at the enterprise level to **No Policy** and enable it at the organization level, which will enable Spark for only certain organizations within your enterprise.\n5. Once enabled, all Copilot subscribers associated with your enterprise or organization can access Spark at [github.com/spark](https://github.com/spark?utm_source=changelog-source-cta&amp;utm_campaign=spark-launch-sep-2025).\n\n### Learn more\n\n- View more details on the [Spark product page](https://www.github.com/features/spark).\n- Read [the Spark documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/spark).\n- Join [the discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/175260) to share your feedback and ask questions.\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
