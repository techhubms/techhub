  "Description": "Nearly a billion commits later, the way we ship code has changed for good. Here’s what the 2025 Octoverse data says about how devs really work now.\n\nThe post [What 986 million code pushes say about the developer workflow in 2025](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/what-986-million-code-pushes-say-about-the-developer-workflow-in-2025/) appeared first on [The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog).",
  "EnhancedContent": "If you’re building software today, you’ve probably noticed that it’s like… really fast now. And that’s the thing: it’s not just *that* we code faster. It’s **how** we code, review, and ship that has changed (and is changing).\n\nYou might have seen [the Octoverse 2025 report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/?utm_source=octoverse-homepage&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25), but in case you haven’t, the stats are pretty wild: developers created 230+ repositories *per minute* and pushed 986 million commits last year. Almost a billion commits! With a **b**!\n\nBecause developers (and teams of developers) are moving faster overall, the expectation is to make different choices *because* they’re moving faster. When they move faster, their workflows change, too.\n\nIteration is the default state\n\nWhat’s really interesting is that this doesn’t feel like a temporary spike. It feels like an actual long-term shift in iteration. The days of shipping big releases once per quarter are rapidly going away.\n\nDevelopers are pushing constantly, not just when things are “ready.” Smaller and more frequent commits are becoming more of the norm. Personally, I love that. Nobody wants to review a gigantic, 1000-line pull request all the time (only to inevitably plop in a “LGTM” as their eyes glaze over). It’s still more code, shipped faster, but in smaller bursts.\n\nThe new normal is lightweight commits. You fix a bug, write a small feature, adjust some configurations, and… push. The shift we’re seeing is that things continue to move, not that things are “done” in huge chunks, because “done”-ness is temporary!\n\n> >\n> “Art Code is never finished, only abandoned iterated upon.”\n> >\n> Leonardo Da Vinci Cassidy, as well as most developers at this point\n\nAnd devs know that shipping constantly is about reducing risk, too. Small, frequent changes are easier to debug, and easier to roll back if things go wrong. You don’t have to sift through a month’s worth of changes to get something fixed.This cycle changes how teams think about quality, about communication, and even hiring. If your team is still moving at a pace where they wait weeks to ship something, your team honestly isn’t working like a *lot* of the world is anymore.\n\nShipping looks different now\n\nBecause we’re iterating differently, we’re shipping differently. In practice, that looks like:\n\n- **More feature flags**: Feature flags used to be “for A/B testing and maybe the spooky experimental feature.” Now they’re **core to how we ship incomplete work safely.** Feature flags are everywhere and let teams ship code behind a toggle. You can push that “maybe” feature to prod, see how it behaves, and then turn it off instantly if something goes sideways. Teams don’t have to hold up releases to finish edge cases. And feature flags are more a part of main workflows now instead of an afterthought.\n- **CI/CD runs everything**: Every push sets off a chain of events: tests, builds, artifact generations, security scans… if it passes, it deploys. Developers expect pipelines to kick in automatically, and manual deploys are more and more rare.\n- **Smaller, focused pull requests**: Pull requests simply aren’t novels anymore. We’re seeing more short, readable pull requests with a single purpose. It’s easier and faster to review, and that mental overhead alone increases speed and saves us some brain cells.\n- **Tests drive momentum**: Developers used **11.5 billion GitHub Actions minutes** running tests last year (a 35% increase! That’s with a b! Again!). With all this automation, we’re seeing unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and all the tests becoming more and more necessary because automation is how we keep up with the new pace.\n\nHow teams communicate should also change\n\nWe know it’s a fact now that developer workflows have changed, but I personally think that communication around development should also follow suit.\n\nThis is how I envision that future:\n\n- Standups are shorter (or async).\n- Status updates live in issues (and “where code lives,” not meetings).\n- “Blocked because the pull request isn’t reviewed yet” is no longer acceptable.\n- Hiring shifts toward people who can ship fast *and* communicate clearly.\n\nYes, the code got faster, so developers have to move faster as well.\n\nDevelopers are still a part of engineering speed. But developer workflows should never slow things down too much.\n\nTake this with you\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see what developer workflows in 2026 look like after such rapid changes in 2025.\n\nI think “AI fatigue” is incredibly real (and valid) and we’ll see many tools fall by the wayside, of course, as the natural productivity enhancers succeed and the ones that add friction go away. But I also think new standards and tooling will emerge as our new “baseline” for our ever-changing success metrics.\n\nIn the future, specs and code will live closer together ([Markdown-to-code workflows are only going to grow](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-using-markdown-as-a-programming-language-when-building-with-ai/)). That will mean more communication across teams, and perhaps even more documentation overall. And we’ll continue to see more and more constant and collaborative shipping (even from companies that are still slow to adopt AI tooling) because it’s necessary.\n\nThis year, we’ve seen a lot of growth across the board in terms of pull requests, projects overall, contributions, and so on… so perhaps we’ll see some stabilization?\n\nBut, of course, the only constant is change.\n\n**Looking to stay one step ahead?**\n\n[Read the latest Octoverse report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/?utm_source=octoverse-homepage&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25) and [consider trying Copilot CLI.](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli?utm_source=blog-cli-tutorial-features&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25post)",
