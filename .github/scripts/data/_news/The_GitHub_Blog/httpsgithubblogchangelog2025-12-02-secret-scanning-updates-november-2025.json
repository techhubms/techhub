  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub secret scanning continually adds support for new secret types. The following updates were made during the month of November.\n\n- **New provider patterns**: Secret scanning added 24 new secret types from providers including Azure, Databricks, Microsoft, Paddle, PostHog, and more.\n- **Improved private key detection**: New patterns for Elliptic Curve and generic PKCS#8 private keys, plus improved detection of escaped newlines.\n- **Extended metadata**: Discord `discord_bot_token`\nnow supports extended metadata checks.\n- **Validity checks:** Validation for AWS Access Key IDs has been improved.\n- **Unlisted gists**: Secrets in unlisted GitHub gists are now reported to secret scanning partners.\n\n## New patterns added\n\nWe added the following new patterns this month. Secret scanning automatically detects any secrets matching these patterns in your repositories.\n\n| Provider | Secret type | Partner | User | Push protection | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Azure | `azure_immersive_reader_key` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Azure | `azure_logic_apps_url` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | crates.io | `cratesio_api_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_account_session_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_federated_account_session_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_oauth_code` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_oauth_refresh_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_oauth_secret_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_oauth_single_use_refresh_token_child` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_oauth_single_use_refresh_token_parent` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_scoped_api_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_scoped_internal_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Databricks | `databricks_workspace_session_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Microsoft | `power_automate_webhook_sas` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | OneSignal | `onesignal_rich_authentication_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Paddle | `paddle_api_key` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Paddle | `paddle_sandbox_api_key` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Pineapple Technologies Limited | `pineapple_technologies_incident_api_key` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | PostHog | `posthog_feature_flags_secure_api_key` | | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | PostHog | `posthog_personal_api_key` | | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Rainforest Pay | `rainforest_api_key` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Rainforest Pay | `rainforest_sandbox_api_key` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) | | Raycast | `raycast_access_token` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (configurable) |\n\n### Private key patterns added\n\n[As announced on November 12](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-11-12-secret-scanning-improves-private-key-detection/), secret scanning now detects additional private key formats:\n\n| Provider | Secret type | Description | | --- | --- | --- | | Generic | `ec_private_key` | Elliptic Curve private keys | | Generic | `generic_private_key` | Generic PKCS#8 private keys |\n\nLike other generic patterns, both types can be configured for inclusion with push protection, but aren’t included by default.\n\n## Detector upgrades and improvements\n\nThe following private key patterns now also detect keys containing escaped newlines (`\\n` ), a common format in configuration files and environment variables:\n\n- `ec_private_key`\n- `github_ssh_private_key`\n- `openssh_private_key`\n- `rsa_private_key`\n\nSentry token types were also renamed to match Sentry’s updated naming conventions:\n\n| Previous name | New name | | --- | --- | | `sentry_organization_token` | `sentry_org_auth_token` | | `sentry_personal_token` | `sentry_user_auth_token` |\n\nThe following secret type now supports extended metadata checks, providing additional context like owner information, creation dates, and organizational details.\n\n| Provider | Secret type | | --- | --- | | Discord | `discord_bot_token` |\n\nWe’ve upgraded validity checks for the following type. With recent improvements to our validation of AWS Access Key IDs, most customers will see alerts that were previously labeled “unknown” switch to “valid” or “invalid”.\n\n| Provider | Pattern | Validity | | --- | --- | --- | | Amazon Web Services (AWS) | `aws_access_key_id` | ✓ |\n\n## Partner notification updates\n\n[As announced on November 25](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-11-25-secrets-in-unlisted-github-gists-are-now-reported-to-secret-scanning-partners/), secrets found in unlisted GitHub gists are now reported to secret scanning partners. Since unlisted gists are accessible to anyone with the URL, leaked secrets in gists should be treated like any other publicly exposed credential.\n\nLearn more about [secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning) and see the [full list of supported secrets](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns) in our product documentation.",
