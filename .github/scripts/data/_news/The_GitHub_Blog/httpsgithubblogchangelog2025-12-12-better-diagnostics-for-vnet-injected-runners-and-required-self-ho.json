As part of this effort, older versions of the actions runner will no longer be supported.\n\n**What’s changing**\n\nOn 1/15/2026, GitHub will require self-hosted runners to use v2.329.0 or later during configuration. Runners using legacy versions will be blocked from connecting to GitHub Actions. This change ensures compatibility with the new architecture and prevents workflow failures during future rollouts.\n\nPreviously, outdated runners could self-upgrade after configuration. Going forward, runners must meet the minimum version requirement before they can register.\n\n**Action required**\n\nUpgrade your self-hosted runners to v2.329.0 or later as soon as possible. For guidance, see the [self-hosted runner documentation](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/runners/self-hosted-runners#runner-software-updates-on-self-hosted-runners).\n\n### Actions runner Docker image updated to Ubuntu 24.04\n\nThe Actions runner Docker image will be updated from Ubuntu 22.04 to Ubuntu 24.04 in the upcoming v2.331.0 release, targeted for January 2026. This update provides access to newer system libraries, security patches, and improved compatibility with modern tooling. If you use custom Docker images based on the actions runner, review your dependencies to ensure compatibility with Ubuntu 24.04. See [pull request #4018](https://github.com/actions/runner/pull/4018) for details.",
