  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub is introducing a premium request overage policy for GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise customers. This will provide you with simplified control over how your enterprise or organization handles premium request usage beyond your account’s included usage.\n\n## What’s changing\n\nInstead of an automatically-created $0 budget that blocks usage when your [premium requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests#what-are-premium-requests) are exhausted, you can now manage overages through a dedicated policy in your Copilot settings. The policy offers you two options:\n\n- **Enabled (default)** – Allow charges for usage beyond your account’s included premium requests\n- **Disabled** – Block usage when your included premium requests are exhausted\n\nIf you have an existing $0 premium request budget in your account, it will **not** be removed. You can remove or modify this budget at any time.\n\n## What’s not changing\n\n- Copilot for individuals (Pro/Pro+) plans are not affected at this time.\n- If you have a premium request budget in your account, it remains unchanged.\n- Your included premium requests and seat pricing remain the same.\n- Your current budgets continue to work as before.\n\n## Learn more\n\n- [Managing your Copilot premium request policy](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/monitor-premium-requests)\n- [About billing for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/billing/organizations-and-enterprises)\n\nHave feedback or questions?
