Previously, triggering an automatic Copilot code review on pull request creation was only available as a subsetting of the **Require a pull request before merging** protection. Now you can adopt automatic reviews without adding merge gating policies, with subsettings for more control over your automatic review flow!\n\n### What’s new\n\nThe new rule includes subsettings to keep feedback up to date as your pull request evolves:\n\n- Run on each push (reruns automatically when new commits are pushed to the pull request)\n- Run on drafts (triggers for draft pull requests so authors can iterate before requesting human review)\n\nWith these changes, you can enable only what matches your or your team’s signal-to-noise preferences. For example, you might start with automatic reviews on creation only, then add on-push reviews for critical branches. Or you might include on-draft reviews in repositories when you want to iterate with Copilot code review before publishing your pull request.\n\nDemo of Copilot code review highlighting an issue and providing a suggestion to apply in Xcode editor\n\n### Getting started\n\n1. Go to **Settings** &gt; **Rules** &gt; **Rulesets** in a repository you have admin access to.\n2. Add or edit a ruleset and select the new automatic Copilot code review rule.\n3. Choose the subsettings you want (on-push, on-draft).\n4. Save the rule and open a new pull request to see Copilot code review run automatically.\n\n[Learn more in the documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/request-a-code-review/configure-automatic-review).\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations).",
