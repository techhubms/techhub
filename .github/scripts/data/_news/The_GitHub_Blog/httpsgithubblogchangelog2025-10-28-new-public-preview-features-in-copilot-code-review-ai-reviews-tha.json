  "EnhancedContent": "Copilot code review (CCR) now blends LLM detections and tool calling with deterministic tools like ESLint and CodeQL, delivering smarter reviews and a seamless handoff to the Copilot coding agent for fixes.\n\n### Rich context with tool calling üß∞\n\nCCR now leverages agentic tool calling to actively gather full project context, including code, directory structure, and references. This enables CCR to understand how your changes fit within the broader project architecture.\n\nüí° *Why it matters:* Feedback is specific, accurate, and with less noise, helping you ship cleaner code faster.\n\n![Diagram of tools in Copilot code review](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6de9a8a5-eb27-4075-8e89-038a6a823b8c)\n\n### New deterministic detections with CodeQl and ESLintüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nCCR now integrates CodeQL and leading linters (starting with ESLint) to combine semantic analysis and classic rule-based checks. This fusion of LLM intelligence and deterministic precision delivers high-signal, consistent findings for security and quality.\n\nüí° *Why it matters:* Developers can trust that critical issues, from security vulnerabilities to maintainability problems, are reliably caught and clearly explained. Only GitHub offers **CodeQL-powered** security and quality insights built directly into AI reviews.\n\n### Seamless handoff to Copilot coding agent ü§ù\n\nYou can now hand off suggested changes directly to the **Copilot coding agent**. Mention `@copilot` in your pull request, and CCR will automatically apply the suggested fixes in a stacked pull request, ready for you to review and merge.\n\nüí° *Why it matters:* Less manual cleanup and fewer review cycles. So you stay focused on higher-value engineering work.\n\n[Demo video: Use of implement suggestion button from CCR comment]\n\n### Customizable workflows and editor availability üõ†Ô∏è\n\nWith customizable workflows and multi-editor support already generally available, CCR now fits seamlessly into every step of your development process, from writing code to reviewing and merging.\n\nTeams can define their own review standards and tone through `instructions.md` or `copilot-instructions.md` files, shaping what CCR prioritizes (e.g., test coverage, performance, or readability). CCR is available in VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Xcode, and on github.com, ensuring consistent feedback wherever you work.\n\nüí° *Why it matters:* CCR adapts to your team‚Äôs standards and meets you where you work.\n\n![Image of copilot-instructions.md containing a list of instructions for Copilot code review to follow written in plain text.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97de7185-908c-4702-bc5c-7dc2dafe5b09)\n\n### Getting started üöÄ\n\nTool calling and deterministic detections are in public preview, enabled by default for Copilot Pro and Copilot Pro Plus users. Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise users can opt in using the Copilot code review policies.\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/177790?utm_source=changelog-community-copilot-code-review&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25).\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
