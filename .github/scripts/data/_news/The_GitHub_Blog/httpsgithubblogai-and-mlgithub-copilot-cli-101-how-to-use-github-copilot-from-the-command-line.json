It’s how you often run scripts, automate workflows, and access APIs.\n\nThe [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli?utm_source=blog-cli-tutorial-features&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25post) brings Copilot’s AI capabilities right into that environment. Instead of jumping between your IDE and browser, you can ask Copilot to generate, explain, or execute commands. In short, Copilot CLI gives you more **precision** and **control** over how you work.\n\nFor instance, you can ask:\n\n``` copilot \"create a bash script to check for uncommitted changes and push if clean\" ```\n\nThe Copilot CLI will write the script, explain what it does, and ask you to confirm before running it.\n\nWhether you’re debugging code, managing environments, navigating a legacy codebase, or handling complex implementations, Copilot CLI helps you work faster without leaving your local environment—saving you time and effort.\n\n**How does GitHub Copilot CLI work?**\n\nCLIs follow a simple loop: you type a command, the system runs it, and you get a result.\n\nGitHub Copilot CLI builds on that workflow but adds an AI-powered twist. Instead of just running predefined commands, you can talk to your terminal in natural language. You tell Copilot CLI what to do, and it figures out the commands to make it happen. ([Copilot CLI also supports a number of slash commands and integrations with MCP to extend its capabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli).)\n\nYou can use Copilot CLI in two ways:\n\n- **Interactive mode** (the default mode) lets you start a session with the copilot command and have a back-and-forth conversation, refining tasks as you go.\n- **Programmatic mode** is for one-off prompts: pass a request directly with -p or –prompt, and Copilot responds inline. For tasks that involve modifying or executing files, you can [enable approval options](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#using-the-approval-options) to keep things [safe](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#security-implications-of-automatic-tool-approval) and consistent.\n\nNo matter how you use it, Copilot CLI will always ask for confirmation before reading, modifying, or executing files. That means you stay in control of your environment. (Note: One exception is if you choose “**Yes, and remember this folder for future sessions”** or **“** **Yes, and approve TOOL for the rest of the session”** when prompted—Copilot will follow these instructions instead. More details in our starter kit below!)\n\n**Starter kit: How to install and use GitHub Copilot CLI**\n\n[Using GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli) is easier than you think. We created a starter kit for you that explains how to install GitHub Copilot CLI, a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the tool, and common use cases and prompts you can use with Copilot in your terminal. Let’s dive in.\n\n**Step one: Installing GitHub Copilot CLI**\n\nTo get started with GitHub Copilot CLI, you need:\n\n- **A GitHub Copilot subscription:** Copilot CLI is currently available with the GitHub Copilot Pro, GitHub Copilot Pro+, GitHub Copilot Business, and GitHub Copilot Enterprise plans.\n- **Node.js version 22 or later**\n- **npm version 10 or later**\n\n[Note: If you get Copilot access from an organization, the Copilot CLI policy must be enabled in your organization’s settings.]\n\n[**Install Copilot CLI**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli) with the following command:\n\n``` npm install -g @github/copilot ```\n\nThat’s it. Now you’re ready to get started. ✨\n\n**Step two: How to use GitHub Copilot CLI**\n\nIt’s time to start using Copilot in the command line (we have step-by-step instructions on [how to do this](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/use-copilot-cli#using-copilot-cli) in our Docs).\n\n1. ****In your terminal, choose the folder with the code you’re working on.\n2. ****Type copilot into the chat box to begin using Copilot CLI. You’ll be prompted to confirm that you trust the contents of the folder.\n\n**Important:** During your GitHub Copilot CLI session, Copilot may read, modify, and execute files in and below this folder. Only proceed if you trust the files in this location. Read [About GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#trusted-directories) to learn more about trusted directories.\n\n1. ****You can select one of these options:\n\n- **Yes, proceed**: Copilot can access and use the files in this location for only this session.\n- **Yes, and remember this folder for future sessions**: The files in this folder are trusted for current and future sessions. When starting Copilot CLI from this folder, you won’t be asked this question again (so only select this option if you are sure that it will always be safe for Copilot to work with these files).\n- **No, exit (Esc)**: End your Copilot CLI session.\n\n1. If you are not currently logged in to GitHub, you’ll be prompted to use the /login slash command. Enter this command and follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate.\n\nEnter your **prompt** in the CLI (we’ll explore some examples of great prompts in the next section!)\n\nSometimes **** you’ll need to **approve** Copilot’s use of tools that modify or execute files. You’ll have three options:\n\n1. **Yes**: Allow Copilot to use this tool once (and approve it again the next time Copilot needs to use the same tool).\n2. **Yes, and approve TOOL for the rest of the session**: Give Copilot full permission to use this tool for the rest of the current session (you’ll need to approve the command again for any future sessions.) This is helpful for when you don’t want to approve commands repeatedly in the same session–but **be aware of the security implications**. For instance, choosing this option for the command rm would let Copilot to delete any file in or below the current folder without needing your approval.\n3. **No, and tell Copilot what to do differently:** Instead of running the command, Copilot will end the current operation and wait for you to prompt it. You can instruct Copilot to continue the task but suggest a different approach.\n\n**Step three: GitHub Copilot CLI use cases, plus example prompts and workflows**\n\nIn this section, we’re providing tons of use cases along with sample prompts that you can feed Copilot to achieve similar outcomes.\n\nGitHub Learn: GitHub Copilot CLI\n\nIn this video tutorial, [@arilivigni,](https://github.com/arilivigni) senior learning advocate and cloud solutions architect at GitHub, demonstrates some foundational ways to use GitHub Copilot CLI to create GitHub issues, pull requests, and more.\n\nHere are some of the GitHub Copilot CLI prompts that were highlighted in the video:\n\n**Create a GitHub Issue:** Log actionable tasks that keep progress visible.\n\n``` Create an issue for adding GitHub Copilot instructions ```\n\n**Create** [**Copilot custom instructions**](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions)**:** Give Copilot more context on your project so it can deliver even better AI assistance that fits your workflows.\n\n``` Create a branch for GitHub Copilot custom instructions ```\n\n**Create a pull request:** Propose changes that enhance code quality.\n\n``` Create a pull request with the changes we have made ```\n\n``` Attach this pull request to issue #4 ```\n\n``` Show the content of issue #4 ```\n\n``` What pull requests are attached to this issue? ```\n\n``` Use the MCP server to list all open issues and pull requests ```\n\n**Use MCP servers to query Microsoft Learn:** Access official Microsoft Learn content directly from the CLI for quick answers and guidance.\n\n``` Using the Microsoft Learn MCP server, tell me all the GitHub Copilot Microsoft Learn modules that exist ```\n\n``` What are the names of the hands-on Skills exercises that exist in each module? ```\n\n``` Create a README with all the Microsoft Learn GitHub Copilot modules and the hands-on skills with headings and subheadings ```\n\n**Create an alias to use with the CLI:** Reduce repetitive effort with shortcuts that boost speed and efficiency.\n\n``` alias grep copilot ```\n\n``` cpcli='copilot --allow-all-tools -p \"$@\"' ```\n\n**Explain and fix scripts:** Diagnose script errors and apply fixes to keep your code running smoothly.\n\n``` cpcli \"Explain each of these scripts and offer improvements\" ```\n\nOther ways to use GitHub Copilot CLI\n\nHere are [some common use cases for GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli#use-cases-for-github-copilot-cli), along with specific prompts you can feed Copilot.\n\n**Codebase maintenance:** Handle security patches, upgrade dependencies, and perform focused refactoring to keep your codebase healthy.\n\n- Request a script for scanning and fixing security vulnerabilities\n\n``` Generate a bash script to run npm audit and apply fixes automatically ```\n\n- Ask for targeted refactoring guidance\n\n``` Upgrade all npm dependencies to their latest safe versions ```\n\n**Generating documentation:** Create or update project documentation that improves clarity and visibility.\n\n- Generate more beginner-friendly documentation.\n\n``` Review the project README to make it easier for newcomers to understand ```\n\n**Understanding your system:** Ask questions about system resources, like how your laptop storage is being used, which folders take up the most space, or what processes are running.\n\n- Get a summary of your laptop’s storage capacity.\n\n``` What is taking up the most space on my own laptop? ```\n\n**Improving test coverage:** Add new test suites and enhance existing ones to strengthen quality assurance.\n\n- Ask Copilot to create a command for generating Jest test files\n\n``` Generate a command to scaffold new Jest test suites for uncovered components ```\n\n- Request a script to run coverage analysis\n\n``` Create a bash script to run npm test with coverage and output a summary report ```\n\n- Ask for best practices for adding integration tests\n\n``` Suggest steps to add integration tests for API endpoints using Supertest ```\n\n**Prototyping new projects:** Kick off greenfield projects and experiment with fresh ideas.\n\n- Ask Copilot to build a proof-of-concept application from scratch\n\n``` Use create-next-app with Tailwind CSS to build a Next.js dashboard.
