  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Enterprise Cloud now offers Enterprise Teams in public preview, streamlining enterprise user and Copilot license management experiences for businesses. Enterprise owners can now:\n\n- Add users directly to the enterprise without requiring organization access. These unaffiliated users do not consume a license by default.\n- Create and manage groups of users in the enterprise account through Enterprise Teams.\n- Enterprise accounts with Enterprise Managed Users can synchronize groups of users from their identity provider to Enterprise Teams via SCIM.\n- Manage Copilot Business licenses for individuals or entire enterprise teams through the enterprise-level Copilot licensing page.\n\nIn the coming months, enterprise owners will also be able to use enterprise teams to:\n\n- Assign an enterprise role.\n- Assign it to a number of organizations within that enterprise, granting organization membership.\n- Empower organization and repository owners to assign roles to teams within their scope.\n\nFor enterprises that do not use enterprise-managed users (EMU), enterprise owners can now invite unaffiliated users to their enterprise. These users will not have access to organizations or licenses by default, but can later be assigned to an enterprise team, an organization, or Copilot Business license.\n\nIf a user is removed from all organizations, they will remain in the enterprise as an unaffiliated user unless the **remove from enterprise** action is taken. Since users may not be automatically removed from your enterprise, we recommend reviewing your offboarding process to ensure it accounts for this change.\n\nAlong with enterprise teams and unaffiliated users now being available to all enterprises, updates have been made to Copilot Business licensing. Enterprise owners can use a dedicated Copilot Business licensing page to assign users and enterprise teams. These updates provide more flexible and scalable license management for enterprises, including the ability to assign Copilot Business to users without also requiring a GitHub Enterprise Cloud license.\n\nTo learn more, check out our documentation on [Enterprise Teams](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/create-enterprise-teams), [unaffiliated users](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/invite-users-directly), and [Copilot Business licensing](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-access/grant-access).
