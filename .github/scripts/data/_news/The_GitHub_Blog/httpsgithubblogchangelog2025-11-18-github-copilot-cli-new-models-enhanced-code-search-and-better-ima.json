  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Copilot CLI continues to evolve with significant improvements to search capabilities, better image support, access to and support for the latest AI models, and reliability enhancements. Here’s what we’ve been working on lately.\n\n## Latest AI models now available\n\nWe’ve added support for the newest models from OpenAI and Google to keep you on the cutting edge:\n\n– GPT-5.1, GPT-5.1-Codex, and GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini\n\n– Gemini 3.5 Pro\n\n## More powerful code search\n\nCopilot now searches your codebase more efficiently! We’ve bundled `ripgrep` into Copilot CLI and added `grep` and `glob` tools to quickly and powerfully find the right context.\n\n## Better image support\n\nPreviously, `@` -mentioning an image file added it to Copilot’s context. Based on your feedback, we’ve enhanced this by allowing images to be added through pasting and drag-and-drop.\n\n## Additional developer delighters\n\n- `/share`\ncommand easily saves your chat session as Markdown files or GitHub gists\n- Removed unnecessary permissions checks when suggested commands contained heredocs and other special characters\n- Improved support for `!`\nshell mode commands in PowerShell\n- Improved automation scenarios using the headless `-p`\nmode by exiting with nonzero codes when encountering permission or communication errors\n- Enhanced the output of the `/session`\ncommand and improved its styling\n- Improved whitespace, formatting, and UI interactions across the application\n- Added support for MCP server tool notifications\n- Improved Copilot’s handling of long-running shell commands\n\n## Reliability and bugfixes\n\nWe’ve fixed a number of user-reported bugs and reliability issues:\n\n– Prevented memory leaks when executing long-running shell commands\n\n– Implemented various bugfixes around custom agent configuration\n\n– Improved handling of Ctrl+C signals and abort operations\n\n– Removed the internal `NODE_ENV` variable from the shell tool’s environment, preventing a clash in Node development scenarios\n\n– Fixed an issue blocking Windows Terminal keyboard input\n\n– Improved error messages when using unsupported models in the `/model` command\n\n– Fixed an issue where background color values were printed to the input box on first launch\n\n## Share your feedback\n\nUpdate GitHub Copilot CLI by running `npm install -g @github/copilot@latest` in your terminal. Thank you to everyone who has submitted feedback via the `/feedback` command and by opening issues in [our public repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli). Your continued feedback is invaluable as we continue to ship improvements.",
