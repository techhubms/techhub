  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Copilot in JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse now includes an **Auto** option that selects the model on your behalf. Choose **Auto** from the model picker in Copilot Chat. This feature is available for all Copilot plans.\n\n### How it works\n\nIn this initial preview, auto optimizes for model availability, currently routing requests to GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, GPT-4.1, Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5, depending on your subscription type. More models are coming soon.\n\n- **Transparency**: You can see which model was used by hovering over the model response.\n- **Stay in control**: Switch between auto and any specific model at any time.\n- **Respects your policies**: Auto honors all user model settings.\n\n### Premium request use\n\nPremium request use for auto is based on the model it selects, which is currently limited to [the models with 0x to 1x multipliers listed above](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests#model-multipliers). Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise subscribers get a 10% discount on the model multiplier when using auto (e.g., when auto uses a model that has a 1x multiplier, you will draw down 0.9 premium requests instead of 1).\n\n### Getting started\n\nIf you are an individual user, head to Copilot Chat in your editor and select **Auto** in the model picker.\n\nIf you’re a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscriber, an administrator will have to enable the **Editor preview features** policy before you can use it. Learn more in [our documentation about auto](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection).\n\n### This is just the beginning\n\nWhile this preview of auto optimizes for model availability, we’re actively working on future updates to make it more intelligent—taking your task and context into account. Your feedback on this preview will directly shape what’s next.\n\nQuestions or feedback? We want to hear from you! Join the [community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations) to share.\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*"
