  "EnhancedContent": "We released three major updates to Copilot Spaces: public spaces, individual sharing, and the ability to add files to a space directly from the github.com code viewer.\n\n## 👥 Public spaces & individual sharing\n\n### Public spaces\n\nYou can now make any space publicly accessible to anyone with the link. This is perfect for:\n\n- Open-source documentation and resources.\n- Sharing templates and workflows with the GitHub community.\n- Cross-organization collaboration.\n- Educational demos.\n\nPublic spaces are only available for individual-owned spaces, not organization-owned spaces. They are view-only by default to protect content integrity. We’ve added individual sharing to add more access controls.\n\n### Individual sharing\n\nIndividual-owned spaces can now be shared. This unlocks lightweight personal workflows and flexible collaboration across individuals.\n\n### Privacy & security\n\nThis release maintains GitHub’s security and trust standards:\n\n- **No private or sensitive content is ever exposed.** Public spaces and individual sharing only surface content the viewer already has permission to see.\n- **Role-based access control is always enforced**, even on public spaces.\n- **Access changes take effect immediately**, ensuring full control at all times.\n- **Public links do not require sign-in**, but viewers only see what they’re already authorized to access.\n- **Public spaces are discoverable only via direct link.** They are not indexed.\n\n## 📎 Add files to a space directly from the code viewer\n\nYou can now add files to a space right from the github.com code viewer. This embedded entry point fits into your natural workflows and reduces context switching.\n\n![Add files to space button in code viewer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c615d6e-a028-4387-a128-df1affc39655)\n\n### Security & permissions\n\n- Users can only add files they have permission to access.\n- Space-level role-based access control and repository access controls continue to apply.\n\n## 💬 Get started & resources\n\n- Try Copilot Spaces today at [github.com/copilot/spaces](https://github.com/copilot/spaces?utm_source=changelog-source-product&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-spaces-public-spaces-dec-2025).\n- Learn more about Copilot Spaces capabilities in the [general availability announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-24-copilot-spaces-is-now-generally-available/)\n- Provide feedback using the inline **Give feedback** button in the UI.\n- [Copilot Spaces documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/context/spaces).\n- [Copilot Spaces billing model](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests).",
