  "EnhancedContent": "Following the previous release of [Copilot Creates Issues](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-19-creating-issues-with-copilot-on-github-com-is-in-public-preview/), you can now create sub-issues and manage issue relationships by chatting with Copilot on [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot).\n\nYou can now:\n\n- Create an issue with multiple sub-issues — ideal for when you want to create a whole new epic.\n- Add sub-issues to existing issues — perfect for breaking down complex work into component parts.\n- Add parent issues to existing issues — best for organizing scattered issues under a main tracking issue.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Navigate to [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot).\n2. Try prompts like:\n- Create me a parent issue and sub-issues for YOUR-IDEA-HERE.\n- Add a sub-issue to issue YOUR-ISSUE-URL-HERE.\n- Break down YOUR-ISSUE-URL-HERE issue into sub-issues.\n3. Review the issues and their relationships within the chat.\n4. Make updates to issues as needed.\n5. Click **Review + Create** to create all issues in one go.\n\n## Helpful tips\n\n- Have a clear structure in mind and include it when using this feature. Copilot uses the details you provide and will make helpful inferences when needed.\n- To make modifications to the issues you have created, ask Copilot to add or remove sub-issues.\n- When reviewing a draft sub-issue, click on the “Parent:” drop down next to the “**Review & Create**” button to view the hierarchy at a glance\n- Leverage pasting [issues as references](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-09-copilot-chat-now-supports-pasting-links/) to enrich your prompt when updating relationships between existing issues.\n\nWith this update, we hope breaking down complex work feels natural, so you can spend more time coding and less time coordinating.\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
