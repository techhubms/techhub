  "EnhancedContent": "Organizations can now [apply Copilot code review to all pull requests, including those from contributors without a Copilot license](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review). Usage is billed seamlessly to the organization as premium requests, without requiring license management. This gives enterprises and open source maintainers greater coverage and confidence with consistent, Copilot-powered in-depth analysis on every pull request.\n\nThis feature is rolling out over the next few days and should become available to your organization shortly after this announcement.\n\n## Standardize code review across your organization\n\nBuilding great software is a team effort, involving many contributors working alongside your core team. Every contributor may not need a full Copilot license, however everyone’s pull requests can benefit from Copilot code review.\n\nPreviously, only licensed users received Copilot code review suggestions. With this release, you can extend Copilot code review to all pull requests in your organization’s repositories, whether or not the contributor has a license. Reviews on unlicensed contributors’ pull requests are billed to your organization as premium requests, while licensed users will continue using their monthly allowance of premium requests with no change to their experience.\n\n**Key benefits:**\n\n- Comprehensive coverage: Apply consistent, Copilot-powered, in-depth analysis across your repositories.\n- Seamless billing: You pay for the premium requests consumed by unlicensed users, without managing additional Copilot seats or setup.\n- Enterprise-grade control: This capability requires explicit opt-in, enabling you to stay in control of the code review policies across your organization.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo enable Copilot code review on pull requests from all (licensed and unlicensed) members in your organization or open source project, the enterprise/org admin must first have Copilot enabled and then opt-in to two policies:\n\n1. Enable [**Premium requests paid usage**](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/manage-request-allowances#setting-a-policy-for-paid-usage) to allow anyone in your organization to use premium requests for Copilot code review.\n\n![Screen shot of the policy setting to allow the enterprise to pay for premium requests beyond the included usage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cdba29d-09b2-4795-a2e1-c15c4d603f32)\n2. Enable **Copilot code review** policy and then turn on the toggle [**Allow members without a license to use Copilot code review in github.com**](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review).\n\n![Screen shot of the new policy setting to allow organization members without Copilot license to use Copilot code review in github.com](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3e6b355-e525-49a9-869a-44e4fb594a1c)\n\n## Monitor usage and manage costs\n\nYou can track the premium request consumption and charges in the [premium requests analytics dashboard](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/monitor-premium-requests#viewing-detailed-analytics-of-your-usage) from the Billing & Licensing page on your account. You can filter the Copilot code review usage and group by user to see the licensed and unlicensed usage. Copilot code review usage from unlicensed members will not have an included allowance associated since it’s charged directly to the organization.\n\nWe also strongly recommend [setting up a premium request budget](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/tutorials/set-up-budgets) to ensure predictable spending and avoid unexpected charges as you enable this capability.\n\nFor more details, see the [Copilot code review documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/agents/code-review).
