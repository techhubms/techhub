  "EnhancedContent": "Get ready for the annual [Game Off](https://gameoff.github.com/), our month-long game jam that has inspired thousands of developers to make, share, and play games since 2012. Whether you’re a first-time jammer or a returning champion, this November is your chance to make something unforgettable.\n\nThe theme for this year? **WAVES**!\n\nYou have until **December 1, 2025, at 13:37 PST** to build a game *loosely* based on the theme. How you interpret it is entirely up to you. Don’t overthink it. Just ride the creative wave and see where it takes you. 🏄🏻\n\n## Need inspiration? Here are a few concept ideas\n\n- A space shooter where you **fly through gravitational waves and wormholes**.\n- A survival game where you build a coastal base and **brace for tsunami waves.**\n- A tower defense game where you **battle waves of increasingly powerful baddies**.\n- A skateboard game where you ride a sine wave, shredding through peaks and troughs.\n- A rhythm game where you **catch the beat and ride the wave**.\n- A racing game where you **drift through vaporwave skylines** and a **totally tubular synthwave soundtrack**.\n- A physics puzzler where you **bounce, reflect, and refract energy waves.**\n- A remake of a class you enjoyed when you were younger resulting in **endless waves of nostalgia.**\n\nWhatever form your game takes, whether it crashes, ripples, or totally wipes out… we can’t wait to see it.\n\n**Pro tip:** Stuck for ideas? GitHub Copilot might be able to help. Try asking, “*What are some fun games I could create with the game jam theme, WAVES*?”\n\n## How to participate\n\nWork alone or on a team. Use whatever programming languages, game engines, or libraries you like.\n\n1. **Sign up.** Create a free GitHub account if you don’t have one.\n2. **Join the jam.** Hop onto the itch.io [Game Off 2025](https://gameoff.github.com/) page. If you don’t already have an itch.io account, you can sign in with your GitHub account.\n3. **Create a public repository.** Store your source code on GitHub. Push your game before **December 1 at 13:37 PST.**\n4. **Submit your game on itch.io.** Once submitted, you’ll be able to play other entries and cast your votes.\n\n## Voting\n\nAfter the submission period ends, participants will vote on each other’s games. Entries will be evaluated in the following categories:\n\n- Overall\n- Gameplay\n- Graphics\n- Audio\n- Innovation\n- Theme interpretation\n\nVoting will end on January 8, 2026, at 13:37 PST. Winners will be announced on the GitHub Blog and social channels on January 10, 2026, at 13:37 PST.\n\n## Light rules\n\nGame Off is intentionally relaxed, but here are a few simple guidelines to keep things fair and fun:\n\n- **Your game must live in a GitHub repository.** You should start from scratch, but you can use templates. The vast majority of the work should be done in the game jam period.\n- **License it however you like.** Open source is encouraged, but not required.\n- **Fly solo or join a team.** Work however you’re most comfortable.\n- **Use any tools or assets you prefer.** Open source, commercial, or your own creations are all welcome.\n- **AI-assisted development is allowed.**\n\nThat’s it. Keep it creative, respectful, and fun, and remember to push your code before the deadline.\n\n## New to game development?\n\nYou don’t need to be an expert. Many participants build their first game during Game Off. Some use popular engines, others build their own, and a few even create games for classic hardware like the NES, Game Boy, or ZX Spectrum. However you make it, there’s no wrong way to play.\n\nHere are a few engines you might want to explore:\n\n- [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/) *(GDScript, C#, C++)*: Great for 2D and 3D games. Open source, lightweight, and beginner-friendly.\n- [**Unity**](https://unity.com/) *(C#)*: Ideal for 3D or mobile games with plenty of tutorials and asset packs available.\n- [**Unreal Engine**](https://www.unrealengine.com/) *(C++, Blueprints)*: Best for cinematic visuals, complex 3D games, and high-end experiences.\n- [**Phaser**](https://phaser.io/) *(JavaScript)*: Good choice for browser-based 2D arcade or platformer games.\n- [**Pygame**](https://www.pygame.org/) *(Python)*: A solid option for learning game development basics or prototyping ideas quickly.\n- [**Bevy**](https://bevy.org/) *(Rust)*: Modern, data-driven engine for developers who like performance and clean ECS design.\n- [**LÖVE**](https://love2d.org/) *(Lua)*: Lightweight and fast, good for 2D games and creative coding projects.\n- [**Flame**](https://flame-engine.org/) *(Dart / Flutter)*: Works well for mobile-first 2D games if you already use Flutter.\n- [**Ebitengine**](https://ebitengine.org/) *(Go)*: Simple and powerful engine for 2D games written in Go.\n- [**Defold**](https://defold.com/) *(Lua)*: Cross-platform 2D engine with built-in tools and an active indie community.\n- [**libGDX**](https://libgdx.com/) *(Java)*: A familiar choice for developers coming from Java or Android backgrounds.\n- [**HaxeFlixel**](https://haxeflixel.com/) *(Haxe)*: Great for retro-style 2D games, platformers, and jam projects.\n\nThe [Game Off 2025 Community](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025/community) is a great place to ask questions or look for teammates. There’s also a friendly community-run Discord server.\n\n## New to Git or GitHub?\n\nGame Off is the perfect opportunity to check it out (version control pun intended).\n\n- [**Git Documentation**](https://git-scm.com/doc)**:** Learn everything about version control and how to get started.\n- [**GitHub Help**](https://help.github.com/)**:** Explore tutorials and FAQs about GitHub.\n- [**GitHub Community Forum**](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/)**:** Ask questions, share ideas, and connect with others.\n\nWhether your build floats or sinks, you’re part of something swell. Join thousands of developers around the world for a month of creativity, learning, and code-powered fun. Let’s *hang ten on your keyboard*  🌊 🤙 and make some WAVES together.\n\n![](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hang10.gif?resize=500%2C281)[*Kung Fury*](https://youtu.be/bS5P_LAqiVg?si=x6h5diWymBdAffN7&amp;t=607) *hanging ten on their keyboard as they surf through time waves on Hackerman’s computer*\n\nGood luck, and have fun!\n\n**Join the jam!** Head to [Game Off 2025](https://gameoff.github.com/) on [itch.io](http://itch.io) to sign up and start building your game &gt;",
