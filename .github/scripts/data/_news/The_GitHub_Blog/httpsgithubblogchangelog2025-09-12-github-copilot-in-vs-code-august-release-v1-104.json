  "EnhancedContent": "The August 2025 update to GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code (v1.104) brings greater flexibility, security, and productivity to AI-powered development workflows.\n\n### Highlights\n\n- **Auto model selection in Copilot Chat**: Copilot can now automatically select AI models for you based on model availability, improving performance and reliability. Auto is now available to all Copilot Free, Pro, and Pro+ subscribers, and coming soon to both Copilot Business and Enterprise. Auto will be billed at a discounted rate for those with Copilot Pro and Pro+ plans.\n- **Confirm edits to sensitive files**: As an additional layer of safety, agent mode now explicitly asks for your confirmation prior to making changes to certain files. With the `setting(chat.tools.edits.autoApprove)`\nsetting, you can configure file patterns that indicate which files require confirmation.\n- **Improved chat and coding agent workflows:** Try the updated experience, complete with collapsed changed files list, contextual prompt file suggestions, and reliability improvements.\n- **Support for `AGENTS.md` files**: Provide additional context and instructions to the agent to guide it towards best practices that are suited for your team’s workflows.\n- **Collaborate with GitHub Copilot coding agent**: Stay in your flow while delegating tasks to GitHub Copilot coding agent. Monitor progress and iterate with the agent all from VS Code.\n- **Enhanced terminal auto approve**: Organizations and individuals can enable or disable terminal auto approve via `chat.tools.terminal.enableAutoApprove`\n, with improved UI for rules and security warnings.\n\nThis is just a sample of the updates in v1.104. For the full list of new features, fixes, and extension improvements, visit the [full VS Code release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_104).\n\nHappy coding!",
