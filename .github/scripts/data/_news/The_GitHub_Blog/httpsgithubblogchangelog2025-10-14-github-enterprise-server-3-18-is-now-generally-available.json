  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) 3.18 enhances deployment efficiency, monitoring capabilities, code security, and policy management. Here are a few highlights in the 3.18 release:\n\n- Enterprise administrators can define custom properties on their enterprise account, create enterprise-level rulesets, and set pull request merge methods using rules. These features provide greater control and consistency across repositories within the enterprise. For more information, see [enterprise rulesets and custom properties](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-03-24-enterprise-custom-properties-enterprise-rulesets-and-pull-request-merge-method-rule-are-all-now-generally-available/).\n- You can organize and classify issues across repositories in an organization using **issue types**, break them down with **sub-issues** to track progress, and use **advanced search** with `AND`\n, `OR` , and parentheses to build complex searches. You can also manage up to **50,000** items in a project, increased from 1,200 items. For more information, see [evolving GitHub Issues](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-04-09-evolving-github-issues-and-projects/).\n- You will now see an updated Issues dashboard page at `*.com/issues`\n, allowing you to easily find and create issues across repositories and organizations and build saved views using custom queries. This page can be accessed through the global navigation menu under **Issues**. For more information, see [saved views on the Issues dashboard](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-15-saved-views-on-the-issues-dashboard/).\n- You can track the progress of code scanning alert resolution with the new “Development” section. This section highlights when an alert is introduced, addressed, or reintroduced, helping you understand the lifecycle of each alert and supporting better code security management. For more information, see [track progress on code scanning alerts](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-02-track-progress-on-code-scanning-alerts-with-the-new-development-section/).\n- Organization administrators can grant Dependabot access to **repositories at scale** from the organization level. GitHub Advanced Security customers can enable Dependabot access permanently for all current and future internal repositories, while all users can use an improved checkbox UI to grant point-in-time access across their repository portfolio. For more information, see [Dependabot access to repositories from the organization level](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-06-03-its-now-easier-to-grant-dependabot-access-to-repositories-from-the-organization-level/).\n- Operators can now use OpenTelemetry metrics to monitor the appliance. This feature is currently in public preview and should only be used in preproduction environments. You can also export Prometheus metrics to third-party monitoring systems. For more information, see [OpenTelemetry metrics](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.18/admin/monitoring-and-managing-your-instance/monitoring-your-instance/opentelemetry-metrics/about-opentelemetry-metrics). We recommend validating the new metrics sooner than later, because the current collectd metrics will be retired and removed in a near future release.\n\nTo learn more about GHES 3.18, check out the [release notes](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.18/admin/release-notes), or [download it](https://enterprise.github.com/releases/3.18.0/download) now.
