If you do not yet have access, please check again later.\n\n### Enabling access\n\nCopilot Business and Copilot Enterprise administrators must opt in by enabling the new GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.1-Codex policies in Copilot settings. Once enabled, users in that organization will see the models in the model picker across all supported IDEs.\n\nFor individual plans, enable either model by selecting it in the model picker in any supported IDE and confirming the one-time prompt.\n\n### Share your feedback\n\nTo learn more about the models available in Copilot, see [our documentation on models](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models) and get started with Copilot today.\n\nJoin the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations) to share your feedback.",
