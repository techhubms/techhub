  "EnhancedContent": "In the latest improvements with Copilot code review, we‚Äôve added a new Copilot code review enterprise and organization setting and Copilot code review is now generally available in Xcode üéâ. Support for Visual Studio, JetBrains, and Eclipse is coming soon!\n\n## Copilot code review generally available in Xcode\n\nUse Copilot code review in Xcode to quickly self-review an open file, a selection, or staged changes before you create a pull request. This helps you catch logic, security, performance, or test gaps early ‚Äî all without leaving your editor. Request a review from the Copilot chat panel in Xcode to get started.\n\nDemo of Copilot code review highlighting an issue and providing a suggestion to apply in Xcode editor\n\n## New enterprise and organization control\n\nWe‚Äôve introduced a new setting that gives enterprises and organizations dedicated control over Copilot code review (CCR). You now have clearer, more predictable controls for managing Copilot code review across your enterprise, whether you use it on GitHub, in VS Code, or as part of a standalone Copilot setup.\n\n### What‚Äôs new\n\n- **Independent control**: Turn Copilot code review on or off separately from other Copilot features like Copilot chat.\n- **Seamless transition**: By default, CCR follows your existing Copilot setup, so there‚Äôs no disruption.\n- **Public preview option**: Users can opt in to try new CCR features early.\n- **VS Code included**: This setting also applies to Copilot code review in Visual Studio Code.\n- **Available everywhere**: The new control is available for both organizations and standalone enterprises (including Copilot-only enterprises without organizations or repositories).\n- **New block policy**: Enterprises can now enforce ‚ÄúBlock Copilot code review in all enterprise repositories‚Äù to fully disable CCR for all users, including individually licensed Copilot users.\n\nIf your enterprise has enabled the `Copilot on GitHub.com` policy (or sub-policies for preview features), CCR remains on by default. Going forward, it must be managed separately from those policies.\n\nFor questions about these changes, join the conversation in our [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/141896?sort=new).",
