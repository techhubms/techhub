This new mode is automatically enabled when a pull request has a **significant** number of changes. Instead of presenting the changes for every file, only the changes for a single file at a time are shown.\n\nTo ease navigation between files, buttons on the toolbar let you jump to the next or previous file.\n\n![Screen shot of the new Files changed page showing new buttons for navigating between files in the pull request when in single file mode](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/522a07fd-f799-496f-926a-07618ca29b26)\n\nWith this change we are also raising the file limit from 300 to **1,000 files**! üéâ\n\n> >\n> Note: This change is rolling out more slowly than usual so we can make adjustments based on your feedback as more users are onboarded.\n> >\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏è Feedback\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt tried the improved experience yet, click the **Try the new experience** link at the top of the existing pull request ‚ÄúFiles changed‚Äù page.\n\nYour feedback is super important to us!
