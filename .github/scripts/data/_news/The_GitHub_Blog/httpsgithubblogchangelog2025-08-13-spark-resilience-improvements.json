  "EnhancedContent": "This week we shipped improvements to make [Spark](https://github.com/spark) more reliable and easier to use during iterations:\n\n- The Iteration panel now correctly filters out in-transit files that were sometimes previously displayed. You’ll now see only the relevant files for your current iteration, making it easier to focus on the files that matter for your development.\n- The Spark data store is now more reliable and resilient. You’ll always see the latest version of your data in your sparks, and the system gracefully handles scenarios where API calls to the data store fail. This ensures a more stable experience when building and running your applications.\n\n### Try out Spark today\n\nVisit [github.com/spark](https://github.com/spark) to build your next app.",
