  "EnhancedContent": "### Overview\n\nWe’re testing improvements to the content and layout of the home dashboard, designed to enable users to understand the current status of their most important work and navigate to it quickly from a single view. The default view of the home dashboard now shows a short, customizable list of pull requests and issues. The feed view is still available. This preview is enabled for a subset of users to start, and rolling out to more over time.\n\n![Screenshot of the new My Work and Feed tabs on the dashboard, with a focus on the new pull requests and issues listed under My Work](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bba01586-1c97-4595-b563-42e3ad6aa085)\n\n### What’s changed\n\n- We created new **My Work** and **Feed** tabs.\n- The **My Work** tab shows users their most-recently updated pull requests and issues, with filtering options to customize the lists.\n- For pull requests the user has authored, actionable next steps are shown.\n- The feed hasn’t changed, but it’s now behind the **Feed** tab. If you prefer the feed, your tab selection is persistent.\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
