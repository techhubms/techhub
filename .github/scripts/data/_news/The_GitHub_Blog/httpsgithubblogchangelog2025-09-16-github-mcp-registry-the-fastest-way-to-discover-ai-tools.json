  "EnhancedContent": "If you’ve tried connecting AI agents to your development tools, you know the pain — MCP servers are scattered across numerous registries, random repositories, and buried in community threads. Without a central place to check, discovery is slow and full of friction. Meanwhile, MCP server creators are worn out from publishing to multiple places and answering the same setup questions again and again.\n\nThe result is a fractured environment that’s fraught with potential security risks.\n\nToday, we’re taking the first step toward solving this challenge. The GitHub MCP Registry launches as your new home base for discovering MCP servers. Whether you’re building with GitHub Copilot, agents, or any AI tool that speaks MCP, this is the place to find what you need. With GitHub already home to most MCP servers, the MCP registry makes them dramatically easier to discover, explore, and use. This helps developers find the right tools faster and contributes to a more open, interoperable ecosystem. Browse the MCP registry today and start building with the tools that power agentic workflows.\n\n[Start browsing](https://github.com/mcp?utm_source=changelog-source&amp;utm_campaign=mcp-registry-server-launch-2025) today to discover amazing MCP servers to power up your AI development!\n\n## Next steps\n\nWe’ve initially launched with a curated selection of MCP servers, but we’re also working with the Model Context Protocol steering committee on the [OSS MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) to eventually allow for self-publication of MCP servers. If you’re an MCP server developer, we encourage you to get involved with the project and give your feedback.",
