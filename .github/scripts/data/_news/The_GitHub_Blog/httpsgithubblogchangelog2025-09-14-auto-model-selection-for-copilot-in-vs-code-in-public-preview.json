  "EnhancedContent": "GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code now includes an **Auto** option that picks the model for you. You can select **Auto** from the model picker. It’s available for Copilot Free, Pro, and Pro+ subscriptions, and is coming soon to Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Business.\n\n### How it works\n\nIn this initial preview, auto optimizes for model availability, currently routing to GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, GPT-4.1, Sonnet 4, and Sonnet 3.5, with more models coming soon.\n\n- **Transparency**: You can see which model was used by hovering over the model response.\n- **Stay in control**: Switch between auto and any specific model at any time.\n- **Respects your policies**: Auto honors all user model settings.\n\n### Premium request use\n\nPremium request use for auto is based on the model it selects, which is currently limited to [the models with 0x to 1x multipliers](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests#model-multipliers) listed above. Copilot Pro and Pro+ subscribers get a 10% discount on the model multiplier when using auto (e.g., when auto uses a model that has a 1x multiplier, you will draw down 0.9 premium requests instead of 1).\n\n### Getting started\n\nHead to Copilot Chat in Visual Studio Code and select **Auto** in your model picker. Learn more in [our documentation about auto](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection).\n\n### This is just the beginning\n\nWhile this preview of auto optimizes for availability, we’re actively working on future updates to make it more intelligent to account for your task. Your feedback on this preview will directly shape what’s next.\n\nQuestions or feedback? We want to hear from you! Join our [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/173188) to share.\n\n*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.*",
