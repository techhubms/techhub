You can use organization custom properties to create highly targeted policies based on each organization’s unique characteristics, whether that’s by department, compliance requirements, geographic region, or any other criteria that matters to your enterprise.\n\n### Better targeting for enterprise rulesets\n\n- **Save time and reduce errors:** No more manual configuration. Set up rulesets that automatically apply the right policies to the right organizations.\n- **Improve security and compliance:** Ensure that the correct security and compliance policies are always in place for each organization.\n- **Greater control and flexibility:** Tailor your policies to the unique needs of each organization within your enterprise.\n\n![A screenshot of the \"Regional Compliance\" code ruleset settings, showing its evaluation status, an empty bypass list, and target organizations defined by region and compliance frameworks.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19aee9db-45e6-43b9-b956-c85b58b0bdec)\n\n## How it works\n\n![A screenshot showing the \"region\" custom property settings, including its name, description, type, options, and other attributes](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f802250c-45ed-4532-8d49-1bc7333ccc9b)\n\nEnterprise administrators can define custom properties at the enterprise level and assign values to individual organizations. Each property can be:\n\n- **Single-select**: Choose one value from a predefined list.\n- **Multi-select**: Choose multiple values from a predefined list.\n- **Text**: Enter free-form text.\n- **True/false**: Set a boolean value.\n\n**Limits and constraints**\n\n- An enterprise can have up to 100 property definitions.\n- An allowed value list can have up to 200 items.\n- Property names may only contain: `a-z`\n, `A-Z` , `0-9` , `_` , `-` , `$` , and `#` .\n- Property values may contain all printable ASCII characters except `\"`\n.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo start using organization custom properties, enterprise administrators can navigate to the custom properties section in the organization section of their enterprise settings.\n\nJoin the discussion and provide feedback during the preview within [GitHub Community](https://gh.io/org-properties-discussion).",
