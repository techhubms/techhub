Returning to Fort Mason Center in San Francisco this October, Universe will be bigger, bolder, and more interactive than ever before. In addition to 100+ expert-led sessions (our full session catalogue drops in early September), you’ll find nine unique spaces designed to spark creativity, connection, and a lot of joy — whether you’re building LEGOs, networking with peers, or exploring new career resources.\n\nIn this blog, we’re breaking down everything you can do on-site so you can start thinking about how you’ll spend your time. Let’s dive in.\n\n## Level up and build with the latest GitHub tools\n\nGo beyond the keynotes and sessions to explore GitHub’s latest tools with help from the people who know them best. If you’re curious about what’s new or want to go deep on the tools you already use, Universe is packed with opportunities to level up. Here’s where to start:\n\n### 🧭 GitHub Central\n\n![A photo of GitHub Central at GitHub Universe.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image7.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\nAfter the morning keynotes, head over to GitHub Central, where you’ll find live demos, customer stories, and product journeys aligned to our three [content tracks](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-universe-2025-heres-whats-in-store-at-this-years-developer-wonderland/#h-what-you-ll-experience) — all designed to help you build more efficiently, securely, and creatively with GitHub.\n\nYou’ll explore GitHub Copilot, GitHub Actions, GitHub Advanced Security, and more. With a mix of self-guided stations, live sessions with GitHub experts, and fun surprises, GitHub Central is your hub for discovery and inspiration.\n\nWhether you’re an enterprise architect or just getting started with automation, you’ll leave with practical ideas and trusted strategies to bring back to your team.\n\n### 💡 GitHub Expert Center\n\n![A photo of the GitHub Expert Center at GitHub Universe.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image4.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\nThe GitHub Expert Center is your go-to for technical deep dives, quick advice, and 1:1 conversations. From specialists in AI and GitHub Actions, to security to scaled adoption, our GitHub experts are on-site and ready to answer all your GitHub product questions.\n\nGetting help is easy; you can book an appointment ahead of time or stop by in between your sessions.\n\n## Fuel your growth (and your network!)\n\nThe future of software is being shared, shaped, and supported by the people behind the code. If you’re interested in joining us at Universe to sharpen your skills, expand your network, or prep to find your next big opportunity, this is the place to start:\n\n### 🌍 Open Source Zone\n\n![A photo of the Open Source Zone at GitHub Universe.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image5.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\nIn the Open Source Zone, you can connect with contributors, maintainers, and community leaders from around the globe.

The Career Corner is here to help you level up with confidence.\n\n### 📚 GitHub Learn\n\nLearning isn’t one-size-fits-all. That’s why GitHub Learn brings together tutorials, certifications, and role-based learning paths to help you grow on your terms. Explore content from GitHub, Microsoft Learn, and more to help you build real, job-ready skills designed for developers at every level.\n\n## Make, tinker, and repeat\n\nAt Universe, some of the most memorable moments happen when you’re solving puzzles, swapping stories with someone you just met, or building something weird and wonderful with AI. The spaces below are yours to unwind, experiment, and rediscover the joy of making.\n\n### 🎯 Recess\n\n![Two people talking and drinking coffee at GitHub Universe.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image9.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\nTake a quick break from sessions and connect over shared interests. Recess is your chance to meet fellow attendees or hang out with coworkers who share your non-dev passions, from Lego building to chatting with executives over gelato.\n\n### 🔮 Makerspace\n\nGet your hands working in the most creative way possible! The Makerspace is where code meets art, music, robotics, and beyond. This is your space to play, explore, and reimagine what code can do. No formal training required — just bring your curiosity.\n\n### 🛠️ Hack your badge\n\nEvery in-person ticket includes a hackable badge — designed to be customized and coded. Follow tutorials, get inspired by other hackers, and create a unique piece of hardware art to commemorate your Universe experience.\n\n>\n> [View this post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBw1rRvI8Cu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading)\n> [A post shared by GitHub (@github)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBw1rRvI8Cu/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading)\n>\n\n### 🛍️ The Shop\n\n![Photo of the Shop at GitHub Universe.](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image6.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)\n\nLooking for GitHub Copilot gear?
