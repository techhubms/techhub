  "EnhancedContent": "CodeQL scans on pull requests for Go, C#, C/C++ and Swift are now incremental. All CodeQL languages now support incremental analysis. This is powered by our [new incremental analysis](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-28-incremental-security-analysis-makes-codeql-up-to-20-faster-in-pull-requests/), which only analyzes new or changed code, as part of the evaluation step. With this release, all the CodeQL supported languages benefit from incremental analysis.\n\nIncremental scans have already shown speed improvements across all newly supported languages. C# and C/C++ evaluations are roughly 5% faster, Go evaluations around 20% faster, and some scans exceed 40% faster. These gains are observed by comparing pull requests (which use incremental analysis) with scheduled runs that scan the entire codebase.\n\nChanges to how the data is processed and reported, introduced with the [introduction of incremental analysis](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-28-incremental-security-analysis-makes-codeql-up-to-20-faster-in-pull-requests/), were already applied to all the CodeQL supported languages with the [initial release](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-28-incremental-security-analysis-makes-codeql-up-to-20-faster-in-pull-requests/) and no further changes were introduced in this release.\n\nIncremental analysis is now available and enabled by default on github.com and will be coming to [CodeQL CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli) users at a later date. On GitHub Enterprise Server this feature will be available starting with version 3.19.\n\nThis release completes the first stage of our broader initiative to make CodeQL scanning faster and more efficient, providing developers with quicker feedback while maintaining the robust security checks that teams rely on."
