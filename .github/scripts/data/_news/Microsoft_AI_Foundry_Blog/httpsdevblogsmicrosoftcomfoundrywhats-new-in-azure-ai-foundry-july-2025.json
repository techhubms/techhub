  "EnhancedContent": "## TL;DR\n\n**Deep Research Agent (Public Preview):** Automate complex, multi-step web research with OpenAI‚Äôs o3-deep-research model, now available in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. **GPT-image-1 model:** Adds input fidelity controls and partial image streaming for advanced image editing and generation. **AgentOps, Red Teaming, and Tracing:** Enhanced agent monitoring, evaluation, and compliance tools. **Platform & Security:** Pay-as-you-go compute, Prompt Shields GA, Entra Agent ID, and Purview integration for secure, scalable AI. **SDK & Docs:** Updates for Python, .NET, Java, and JavaScript SDKs; new guides for Deep Research and agent development.\n\n## üöÄ Join the Azure AI Foundry Developer Community\n\n**Never build alone, join the community!** Connect with 25,000+ developers via Discord, GitHub Discussions, and live events. Access open-source courses, code samples, and weekly office hours for AI Agents, MCP, and Generative AI.\n\n[Join Community](https://aka.ms/foundrydevs?utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=whats-new-july-2025&amp;utm_content=developer-community)\n\n## Models\n\n### **GPT-image-1** model adds two new features (in preview):\n\n- **Input fidelity parameter:** The new `input_fidelity`\nparameter in the image edits API lets you control how closely the model preserves the style and features of the original image. This is useful for editing photos (e.g., facial features, avatars), maintaining brand identity, and realistic product imagery.\n- **Partial image streaming:** The image generation and edits APIs now support partial image streaming, providing users with early visual feedback as images are rendered.\n\n[Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/whats-new?utm_source=devblog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=whats-new-july-2025&amp;utm_content=model-leaderboard#july-2025)\n\n## Agents\n\n### Deep Research Agent (Public Preview)\n\nAzure AI Foundry Agent Service now offers the **Deep Research Agent** in a limited public preview. [Sign up for preview access](https://aka.ms/oai/deepresearchaccess) to Deep Research enabling developers to automate complex, multi-step web research using OpenAI‚Äôs advanced agentic research model (`o3-deep-research` ), tightly integrated with Bing Search for authoritative, up-to-date results.
