  "EnhancedContent": "## TL;DR\n\n- **Move from prototype to production in hours, not weeks:** The new Microsoft Agent Framework and Hosted Agents let you build, test, and deploy multi-agent AI systems with enterprise-grade security—no Kubernetes or container headaches.\n- **Orchestrate any model, anywhere:** Model Router and BYO Model Gateway let you mix and match thousands of models (including Claude, GPT, and your own) with unified governance and compliance—no code changes required.\n- **Ship agents to Teams and M365 with one click:** New low-code/no-code tools, templates, and deployment channels make it easy to launch and scale AI agents for your users.\n- **Build smarter, more reliable workflows:** Multi-agent orchestration, persistent memory, and deep Microsoft 365 integration enable robust, context-aware solutions for complex enterprise scenarios.\n- **Fine-tune and innovate faster:** Redesigned UI, support for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) on GPT-5, and parity for non-OpenAI models like Mistral accelerate custom model development.\n- **Access the best models in one place:** Azure is now the only cloud with both Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI’s GPT models—choose the right tool for every job.\n- **Build with confidence:** Foundry Control Plane, new guardrails, and granular security controls give you enterprise-grade observability, compliance, and peace of mind.\n\n## Agents\n\n### **Microsoft Agent Framework + Hosted Agents**\n\n**Microsoft Agent Framework** is an open-source SDK and runtime for building, deploying, and managing multi-agent AI systems. It combines the enterprise-ready stability of Semantic Kernel with the innovative orchestration patterns from AutoGen, creating a unified foundation for both experimentation and production. Current agent frameworks are fragmented and lack enterprise features like observability, compliance, and durability. Microsoft Agent Framework addresses these gaps by providing security, governance, and scalability for agentic AI applications.\n\n- Rapid prototyping: Build and test agentic workflows locally, then deploy seamlessly to production—no need for complex containerization or infrastructure setup.\n- Cross-cloud flexibility: Connectors for Azure, AWS, and GCP let you leverage best-in-class models and tools, regardless of cloud provider.\n- Enterprise-grade features: Built-in observability, identity, governance, and autoscaling mean you can focus on agent logic, not ops.\n- Unified build-and-run story: Move from prototype to production with transparent consumption-based pricing and robust compliance.\n\n[Download SDK](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework) [Explore docs](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/Docs)\n\n**Hosted agents** in **Foundry Agent Service** make it effortless for teams to move from local experimentation to full-scale production. Developers can now deploy custom-code agents built with **Microsoft Agent Framework**, **LangGraph**, **CrewAI**, or other open-source frameworks directly into a **fully managed runtime**—no container images, Kubernetes clusters, or deployment pipelines required. This eliminates containerization or infrastructure setup so developers can focus on agent logic, while Foundry provides enterprise-grade identity, observability, governance, and autoscaling. Together, Agent Framework and Hosted Agents give teams a clear path from local prototypes to secure, production-grade deployments with transparent consumption-based pricing.​\n\n[Explore Microsoft Agent Framework announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/)\n\n### **Foundry Agent Service**\n\nAt **Microsoft Ignite 2025**, we introduced the next evolution of **Foundry Agent Service**, managed runtime for agentic apps, supporting multi-agent workflows, persistent memory, and enterprise governance.

The Agent Service honors **pre/post LLM hooks**, **policy-based model selection**, and **multi-region/multi-provider load-balancing with automatic failover**, so teams can optimize for **latency, cost, compliance, and availability** without changing application code. This enables organizations to build agents using their own managed endpoints while maintaining enterprise-grade governance, security, and compliance.\n\n- **Flexibility & Choice:** Enterprises often have specialized models tuned for their domain. “Bring your own models” ensures these models can coexist with Foundry’s 11,000+ available models, giving developers ultimate choice.\n- **Preserve Investments:** Many organizations have invested heavily in custom models. “Bring your own models” lets them leverage those investments without rebuilding everything for a new platform.\n- **Unified Governance & Security:** Even when using external models, the gateway enforces Foundry’s security, identity, and policy controls (via Control Plane), so compliance and observability remain consistent.\n- **Accelerates Innovation:** Developers can combine internal models with Foundry’s hosted agents, multi-agent workflows, and tools—unlocking richer, more tailored AI solutions without sacrificing speed or trust.\n- **Future-Proofing:** “Bring your own models” supports hybrid and multi-cloud strategies, making it easier to adapt as model ecosystems evolve.\n\n[Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/ai-gateway?view=foundry)\n\n### **Enterprise MCP enhancements in Foundry agents**\n\nMicrosoft Foundry has enhanced integration to Enterprise MCP to enable secure, authenticated connections to MCP servers, allowing credentials to be stored and passed for public environments. These updates enable enhanced flexibility, security, and compliance when integrating MCP with Microsoft Foundry.\n\n### **Built-in memory in Foundry Agent Service**\n\nThe new long-term memory in Foundry Agent Service gives developers a robust, scalable foundation for agents that can remember, adapt, and act coherently across sessions and workflows. Integrated directly into the Foundry runtime, memory provides a persistent layer where agents can store and retrieve chat summaries, user preferences, and key task outcomes. It enables more natural, consistent, and personalized agent behavior.\n\n### **Multi-Agent Workflows**\n\nMulti-agent workflows are an orchestration capability in **Foundry Agent Service** that lets developers design and run **complex, multi-step processes involving multiple specialized agents**. Instead of building a single monolithic agent, you can coordinate a network of agents—each focused on a specific task—into a structured workflow.\n\n- **Fine-grained control:** Design workflows visually or in code, with robust state management and human-in-the-loop controls.\n- **Enterprise extensibility:** Add specialized agents (e.g., payment, escalation) and maintain clean separation of concerns.\n- **Long-term reliability:** Persistent state and error recovery make workflows robust for mission-critical scenarios.\n\n[Read more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-agent-service-at-ignite-2025-simple-to-build-powerful-to-deploy-trusted-/4469788)\n\n### **Agent mitigations and guardrail customization**\n\nAt Ignite, Microsoft introduced guardrails for agents in Microsoft Foundry Control Plane. Formerly called content filters, guardrails can now be applied at the agent level rather than only to model deployments. They include existing controls to help mitigate prompt injection attacks, harms and risks, and to support groundedness. Our newest risk that can be detected, task adherence, helps keep agents on task, detecting when an agent’s next proposed action starts to drift off task.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced a new control model that gives customers more flexibility in how they configure their guardrails and steer agent behavior. Customers can choose the risk they want to monitor, pick where the system should intervene, and decide what action to take. Intervention points include prompts and outputs, and for Ignite now also includes tool calls and tool responses. Available actions include annotation or blocking.\n\n## Models\n\n### **Anthropic Models now available on Microsoft Foundry**\n\nMicrosoft Foundry now offers Anthropic’s Claude models (Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.1) alongside GPT models, making Azure the only cloud platform with access to both frontier model families in one place.\n\n- **Model Strengths & Use Cases**\n- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: Fast, cost-efficient for real-time experiences and lightweight agents.\n- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Best for complex agents, coding, cybersecurity, and research.\n- **Claude Opus 4.1**: Advanced reasoning for long-horizon tasks, AI agents, and specialized workflows.\n- **Flexibility & Choice**: Access both Claude and GPT models in one platform for diverse use cases.\n- **Enterprise Integration**: Built-in governance, observability, and compliance for production-ready AI.\n- **Agentic Workflows**: Move beyond prototypes to scalable, automated workflows with Claude as the reasoning core.\n- **Reusable Skills**: Standardize and scale automation across projects using modular Skills.\n- **Advanced Capabilities**: Deep Research and MCP integration enable richer, context-aware AI systems.\n\n[Anthropic’s Claude models announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-anthropics-claude-models-in-microsoft-foundry-bringing-frontier-intelligence-to-azure/)\n\n### **Sora 2 API**\n\nOpenAI’s Sora 2 is now available in public preview within Microsoft Foundry.
