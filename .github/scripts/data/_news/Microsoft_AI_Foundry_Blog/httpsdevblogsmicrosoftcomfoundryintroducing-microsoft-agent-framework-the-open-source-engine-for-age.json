  "EnhancedContent": "## Why agents need a new foundation\n\nOver the last year, developers have been experimenting with **AI agents** in every imaginable form. Agents are not just chatbots or copilots — they are autonomous software components that can reason about goals, call tools and APIs, collaborate with other agents, and adapt dynamically. Whether it’s a **retrieval agent** for research, a **coding agent** embedded in a dev workflow, or a **compliance agent** ensuring policy enforcement, agents are becoming the next layer of application logic.\n\nYet despite the excitement, the **path from prototype to production has been fraught with obstacles**. Many of the most popular open-source frameworks are fragmented, each with their own APIs and abstractions. Local development rarely maps cleanly to cloud deployments. And most importantly, **enterprise readiness is missing**: observability, compliance hooks, security, and long-running durability are table stakes in OSS frameworks.\n\nAt Microsoft, we’ve had a front-row seat to this problem. With **Semantic Kernel**, we gave developers a stable SDK with connectors into enterprise systems, content moderation, and telemetry. With **AutoGen**, pioneered in Microsoft Research, we opened the door to experimental multi-agent orchestration patterns that inspired the community. Both had passionate users — but each had gaps.\n\nDevelopers asked us: *why can’t we have both — the innovation of AutoGen and the trust and stability of Semantic Kernel — in one unified framework?*\n\nThat’s exactly why we built the [**Microsoft Agent Framework**](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework).\n\n## Introducing Microsoft Agent Framework\n\nMicrosoft Agent Framework is an **open-source SDK and runtime** designed to let developers build, deploy, and manage sophisticated multi-agent systems with ease. It unifies the **enterprise-ready foundations of Semantic Kernel** with the **innovative orchestration of AutoGen**, so teams no longer have to choose between experimentation and production.\n\n| | **Semantic Kernel** | **AutoGen** | **Microsoft Agent Framework** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Focus** | Stable SDK with enterprise connectors, workflows, and observability | Experimental multi-agent orchestration from research | Unified SDK combining innovation + enterprise readiness | | **Interop** | Plugins, connectors, and support for MCP, A2A, OpenAPI | Tool integration supported; lacks standardized cross-runtime protocols | Built-in connectors, MCP + A2A + OpenAPI | | **Memory** | Multiple vector store connectors and memory store abstraction (e.g. Elasticsearch, MongoDB) | Support for in-memory / buffer history + external vector store memory options (ChromaDB, Mem0, etc) | Pluggable memory across stores (first-party and third-party), persistent & adaptive memory stored with retrieval, hybrid appraoches | | **Orchestration** | Deterministic + dynamic orchestration (Agent Framework, Process Framework) | Dynamic LLM orchestration (debate, reflection, facilitator/worker, group chat) | Deterministic + dynamic orchestration (Agent Orchestration, Workflow Orchestration) | | **Enterprise readiness** | Telemetry, observability, compliance hooks | Minimal | Observability, approvals, CI/CD, long-running durability, hydration |\n\nWith Microsoft Agent Framework, you get:\n\n- **Open standards & interoperability** — MCP, A2A, and OpenAPI ensure agents are portable and vendor-neutral.\n- **Pipeline for research-to-production** — bleeding-edge orchestration patterns from Microsoft Research are now ready for enterprise use.\n- **Community-driven extensibility** — modular by design, with connectors, pluggable memory, and declarative agent definitions.\n- **Enterprise readiness** — built-in observability, approvals, security, and long-running durability.\n\n**Microsoft Agent Framework doesn’t replace Semantic Kernel and AutoGen — it builds on them.** By consolidating their strengths, it gives developers one foundation to move from experimentation to enterprise deployment without compromise. Microsoft Agent Framework supports both **Agent Orchestration** (LLM-driven, creative reasoning and decision-making) and **Workflow Orchestration** (business-logic driven, deterministic multi-agent workflows). Together, they allow teams to choose the right approach for the problem: flexible collaboration for open-ended tasks, or structured workflows for repeatable enterprise processes.\n\nLooking ahead, Microsoft Agent Framework further advances integrations across Microsoft’s agent development stack, including the integration with the **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK** and a shared runtime with **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**. The Microsoft 365 Agents SDK is the pro-code toolkit that lets developers build full-stack, multi-channel agents and publish them across Microsoft 365 Copilot, Teams, web, and other surfaces, with deep interoperability into Copilot Studio’s low-code connectors and Microsoft 365 Copilot custom engine agents. By converging this SDK with Microsoft Agent Framework—and aligning it with the shared runtime used in Foundry Agent Service—developers will gain **one unified set of abstractions** to create, run, scale, and publish agents. This means you can prototype locally, debug with consistent telemetry, and then seamlessly move into scaled hosting with enterprise-grade observability, compliance, and security—all without rewriting your agents—and then publish them into any communication channels of choice where you want to surface your agents.\n\n[![AgentStack image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAACZAQMAAACvw5VEAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHUlEQVRYhe3BgQAAAADDoPlTH+ECVQEAAAAAAMcAF08AAW8JAr4AAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/09/AgentStack.png)\n\n##\n\n## The Four Pillars of Agent Framework\n\n1. ### **Open Standards & Interoperability**\n\nAgents don’t exist in isolation — they need to connect to data, tools, and each other. Microsoft Agent Framework was built with open standards at its core, so developers can choose their integrations and ensure their systems remain portable across frameworks and clouds.\n\n- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Agents can dynamically discover and invoke external tools or data servers exposed over MCP. Microsoft Agent Framework makes it easy to connect to a growing ecosystem of MCP-compliant services without custom glue code.\n- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A):** Agents can collaborate across runtimes using structured, protocol-driven messaging. A2A support allows developers to create workflows where one agent retrieves data, another analyzes it, and a third validates results — even if they’re running in different frameworks or environments.\n- **OpenAPI-first design:** Any REST API with an OpenAPI specification can be imported as a callable tool instantly. Microsoft Agent Framework handles schema parsing, tool definition, and secure invocation so developers can leverage thousands of enterprise APIs without building wrappers by hand.\n- **Cloud-agnostic runtime:** Agents can run in containers, on-premises, or across multiple clouds, making them portable across environments. Developers can spin up a single agent with their preferred SDK (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, etc.), add tools by wrapping existing methods as AIFunctions, and immediately connect to external APIs.\n\nThe latest update to the [**VS Code AI Toolkit**](https://aka.ms/aitoolkit)brings a streamlined experience for building with the **Microsoft Agent Framework**, enabling developers to locally create, run, and visualize multi-agent workflows. These enhancements simplify the inner dev loop, making it easier to build, debug, and iterate on multi-agent systems within the familiar VS Code environment.\n\n[![VSCode compressed image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAAChAQMAAABH6hCEAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHUlEQVRYhe3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQo/oAAAAAAAAC4GGIcAASOP82AAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/09/VSCode_compressed.jpg)\n\n1. ### **Pipeline for Research**\n\nMicrosoft Agent Framework is designed to be the bridge between **research innovation** and **enterprise-ready production**. Many of the most exciting breakthroughs in multi-agent [orchestration patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/ai-agent-design-patterns) come out of Microsoft Research in AutoGen, and the new framework makes those ideas usable in real-world systems without sacrificing durability, governance, or performance.\n\nThe framework supports:\n\n- **Sequential orchestration** for step-by-step workflows.\n- **Concurrent orchestration** where agents work in parallel.\n- **Group chat orchestration** where agents brainstorm collaboratively.\n- **Handoff orchestration** where responsibility moves between agents as context evolves.\n- **Magentic** **orchestration** where a manager agent builds and refines a dynamic task ledger, coordinating specialized agents (and sometimes humans) for complex, open-ended problems.\n\nTo serve both innovators and production-minded developers, Microsoft Agent Framework also provides an **extension package for experimental features** — a clearly labeled incubation channel where advanced users can try out cutting-edge capabilities from Microsoft Research and the open-source community. These features are transparent about their experimental status, while successful innovations graduate naturally into the stable framework.\n\nThese patterns — once prototypes — now run with durability, auditability, and enterprise controls. It’s the best of research innovation, matured for real-world use.\n\n1. ### **Extensible by Design & Community-Driven**\n\nMicrosoft Agent Framework is **100% open source** and designed to grow with the community. Its modular design makes it easy to extend, customize, and contribute.\n\n- **Connectors to enterprise systems:** Agent Framework inherits a broad set of built-in connectors (Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Fabric, SharePoint, Oracle, Amazon Bedrock, MongoDB, and a various SaaS system through Azure Logic Apps) so agents can work with enterprise data from day one.\n- **Pluggable memory modules:** Developers can choose [Redis](https://aka.ms/Redis/AFBlog), Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Elasticsearch, Postgres, or their own store for conversational memory. Agent Framework provides the abstraction; you decide the backend.\n- **Declarative agents** **:** YAML or JSON definitions allow developers to specify prompts, roles, and tools declaratively. These files can be version-controlled, templatized, and shared across teams.\n- **Community innovation:** Agent Framework is designed to absorb community-driven orchestration strategies, new connectors, and best practices.\n\nThis means Microsoft Agent Framework is not a fixed product — it’s a **living ecosystem**, continuously shaped by contributions from Microsoft Research and the global OSS community.\n\n1. ### **Ready for Production**\n\nMicrosoft Agent Framework isn’t just for experimentation — it was built for enterprise-grade deployment from the very beginning. It delivers the end-to-end tooling and runtime features needed to confidently move from prototype to scale, while integrating deeply with the Azure AI Foundry ecosystem.\n\n- **Observability:** [OpenTelemetry](https://aka.ms/MultiAgentTracingBlog) can instrument and visualize every agent action, tool invocation, and orchestration step, making it easy to trace reasoning flows and monitor performance through Azure AI Foundry dashboards.\n- **Secure Cloud Hosting:** Agents will run natively on Azure AI Foundry with enterprise controls like virtual network integration, role-based access, private data handling, and built-in content safety.\n- **Security & compliance:** Azure AI Content Safety integration, Entra ID authentication, and structured logging mean Agent Framework agents can run in regulated industries.\n- **Long-running durability:** Agent threads and workflows can pause, resume, and recover from interruptions, with retry and error-handling logic ensuring long-running processes remain reliable at scale.\n- **Human in the loop:** For scenarios that require governance, tools can be marked as requiring human approval. Agent Framework automatically emits a pending approval request that can be routed to a UI or queue, then continues or denies execution accordingly. This works across local tools or remote service calls, ensuring sensitive operations remain under control.\n- **CI/CD integration:** The framework integrates directly into GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps pipelines, with telemetry flowing into Azure Monitor and Application Insights for enterprise-grade deployment and root-cause analysis.\n\nWith these capabilities, Microsoft Agent Framework makes it seamless to **prototype locally, debug with rich telemetry, and then scale securely into production** with the enterprise readiness that modern AI systems demand.\n\n##\n\n## Customer Momentum\n\nEnterprises across industries are already testing Microsoft Agent Framework in real-world scenarios:\n\n[![AgentFramework customers image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAAByAQMAAADTQH4FAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAG0lEQVRYhe3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQdvoAAAAAD4DRFeAAF02fteAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/09/AgentFramework-customers.png)\n\n- [**KPMG**](https://aka.ms/kpmgagentframework) is building *Clara AI*, a multi-agent system that automates audit testing and documentation. *“Foundry Agent Service and Microsoft Agent Framework connect our agents to data and each other, and the governance and observability in Azure AI Foundry provide what KPMG firms need to be successful in a regulated industry”* – Sebastian Stöckle, Global Head of Audit Innovation and AI, KPMG International\n- **Commerzbank** is piloting Microsoft Agent Framework to power avatar-driven customer support, enabling more natural, accessible, and compliant customer interactions. *“The new Microsoft Agent Framework simplifies coding, reduces efforts and fully supports MCP for agentic solutions.

Both projects will remain supported but most investment is now focused on Microsoft Agent Framework. Developers using **Semantic Kernel** or **AutoGen** will find the transition straightforward:\n\n- For **Semantic Kernel**users:\n- Migration is straightforward: replace Kernel and plugin patterns with the **Agent** and **Tool** abstractions.\n- .NET developers move from Microsoft.SemanticKernel.\\* to the new Microsoft.Extensions.AI.\\* namespaces, with agents created directly from providers instead of requiring Kernel coupling.\n- Python developers can install the full package (pip install agent-framework) or just the components they need (e.g., agent-framework-azure-ai, agent-framework-redis).\n- Agents now manage threads natively, simplify invocation with RunAsync / RunStreamingAsync, and register tools inline without attributes or plugin wrappers.\n- Existing vector store integrations (Azure AI Search, Postgres, Cosmos DB, Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.) continue to work through connectors.\n- Plugins like Bing, Google, OpenAPI, and Microsoft Graph port directly as tools, often exposed via MCP or OpenAPI.\n- The net result: **less boilerplate, simplified memory management, and alignment with open standards.**\n- For **AutoGen**users:\n- AutoGen pioneered many orchestration patterns (GroupChat, GraphFlow, event-driven runtimes), which are now unified in Agent Framework under the **Workflow** abstraction.\n- The AssistantAgent maps directly to the new ChatAgent, which is multi-turn by default and continues tool invocation until a result is ready.\n- FunctionTool wrappers migrate to the @ai\\_function decorator, with automatic schema inference and support for hosted tools like code interpreter or web search.\n- Messaging is simplified: multiple message classes are replaced with a unified ChatMessage type, with explicit roles (USER, ASSISTANT, TOOL, SYSTEM).\n- Orchestration shifts from event-driven models to a typed, graph-based Workflow API that supports checkpointing, pause/resume, and human-in-the-loop flows.\n- Observability is richer and simpler, with OpenTelemetry support out of the box.\n- Most single-agent migrations require only light refactoring; multi-agent migrations benefit from the new Workflow model with stronger composability and durability.\n\nThis continuity means developers can preserve their existing investments while unlocking new capabilities. Microsoft Agent Framework is not a replacement for what came before — it is the natural evolution that unites innovation and stability. For more information about migration, see the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview).\n\n## Get Started with Microsoft Agent Framework Today\n\nAgents are fast becoming the next layer of application logic — reasoning about goals, calling tools, collaborating with each other, and adapting dynamically. With Microsoft Agent Framework, developers now have a single, open-source foundation that carries the best of research innovation into production with the durability, observability, and enterprise readiness required to scale.\n\nThis is the natural evolution of the journey that began with Semantic Kernel and AutoGen — and it’s only the beginning. By building in the open and co-creating with the developer community, Microsoft Agent Framework will continue to evolve as the foundation for next-generation multi-agent systems.\n\n- - **Download the SDK:** [aka.ms/AgentFramework](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework)\n- **Explore documentation for more details:** [https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/Docs](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/Docs)\n- **See it in action:** Watch demos on [AI Show](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/AIShow) and [Open at Microsoft](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/OpenAtMicrosoft)\n- **Learn step by step**: [Microsoft Learn modules for Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-agents-on-azure/) and [AI Agents for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners)\n- **Join the** [**Azure AI Foundry Discord**](https://aka.ms/foundry/discord) to connect with developers and product groups, sharpen your AI skills, and stay inspired through real-time community.
