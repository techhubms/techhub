Over the next three years, [92% of companies plan on investing in AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work) to achieve business outcomes like enhancing productivity and delivering better customer service.\n\nAt Microsoft, developers and engineers are pushing the boundaries of AI at scale, crafting applications that harness the power of cutting-edge machine learning models and advanced AI techniques. To help both newcomers and seasoned AI developers understand these methodologies, we are thrilled to introduce a new video series – How Microsoft engineers build AI.\n\nWe’ll cover many different topics in this series, starting with one of the most common updates that developers are making with AI: implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into applications. This can be challenging to do reliably at scale, but with the right guidance and best practices in place, it becomes manageable.\n\nIn our first episode, we cover how Microsoft engineering teams developed the popular RAG plugin within Copilot for Azure: *Ask Learn*.\n\nCloud Advocate Frank Boucher interviews Sr. Product Managers Brian Steggeman and Eric Imasogie, as well as Principal Software Engineer Manager Tianqi Zhang, to discuss their techniques and best practices for building RAG solutions like *Ask Learn*. They share their experiences and challenges from developing the *Ask Learn* plugin, and how they used RAG to surface accurate, contextually relevant information for users by leveraging proprietary data and large language models (LLMs).\n\n## What you’ll learn:\n\nIf you’re interested in building your own RAG-based applications, this video is a must-watch. It provides valuable insights and practical advice on prototyping, data management, and common pitfalls to avoid. It covers:\n\n- The concept of RAG and how it differs from other model improvement techniques like fine-tuning.\n- The practical applications of RAG in various Microsoft products, including Copilot in Azure, Microsoft Security Copilot, and Dynamics 365 Business Central.\n- The challenges faced during content selection, preprocessing, and RAG performance evaluation.\n- The innovative solutions used to ensure the plugin delivers accurate and up-to-date responses.\n\nThis episode also includes a demonstration of how the *Ask Learn* plugin helps Azure developers get answers in seconds, directly in their workflow. This is a great opportunity to learn how to build RAG, and use it, directly from the experts.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this first installment of the Microsoft Engineering Series: AI in Action!
