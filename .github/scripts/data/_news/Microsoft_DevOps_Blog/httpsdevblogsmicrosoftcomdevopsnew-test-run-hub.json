Whether you’re running manual or automated tests, the new test run hub brings clarity and efficiency to your quality assurance workflow.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n*Real-Time Visibility:* Instantly monitor test progress and quality trends, so you can spot regressions or failures before they impact your release.\n\n*Comprehensive Analytics:* Dive into historical test data to audit, analyze, and continuously improve your testing strategy.\n\n*Seamless end to end user flow:* Test runs are created automatically from test plans or automated test pipelines, capturing every detail of an execution’s outcomes.\n\n## Effortless Test Run Management\n\nAccessing and managing your test runs has never been easier:\n\nNavigate to the Test Plans section in your Azure DevOps project and select “Runs” under the Test Plans section.\n\nUse powerful filters—timeline, run type, test run ID, and more—to find exactly what you need.\n\nCustomize your view with persistent search and column settings, ensuring your dashboard always fits your workflow.\n\n## Actionable Insights at Your Fingertips\n\nEach test run comes with a built-in analytics dashboard, breaking down results by outcome, priority, configuration, failure type, and resolution. Do you want to focus on a specific area? Just click a dashboard tile to filter and drill down for deeper insights.\n\n[![run analytics image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAACvAQMAAAB94HH0AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHUlEQVRYhe3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAOBgGqkAAWlbAQIAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/run-analytics-scaled.png)\n\n## Attachments, Work Items, and Collaboration\n\nAdd screenshots, logs, and other artifacts directly to your test runs for richer context and deep dive analysis.\n\nLink test results to Azure DevOps work items, like bugs or tasks, so nothing falls through the cracks.\n\nCollaborate with your team using run-level comments (markdown supported!) and detailed dedicated analysis fields.\n\n## Few More Improvements Highlights\n\n**Filtering Enhancements**\n\n- Filter test runs by the pipeline where the test was executed.\n- User-specific filter selections in the Test Run Hub are now saved automatically.\n- Filter test results by area path for more targeted analysis.\n\n**Attachment Support**\n\n- Expanded preview capabilities for a wide range of attachment file types.\n- Ability to delete attachments from test runs.\n\n**Markdown Support for Comments**\n\n- Rich markdown controls now available for enhanced comment formatting.\n\n## Programmatic Power for Advanced Teams\n\nDo you need more configurations? The Test Run Hub supports programmatic management via the [Azure DevOps REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/test/runs?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1).
