  "EnhancedContent": "[In May](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-devops-with-github-repositories-your-path-to-agentic-ai/), we talked about the evolution of GitHub Copilot from a coding assistant into an AI powered peer programmer. Since then, GitHub has taken a major step forward – becoming an open platform for agentic development, where [Agent HQ](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/welcome-home-agents/) enables developers to orchestrate any agent, anytime, anywhere. Agent HQ provides observability, governance, and security controls for agents, so organizations can manage access, audit usage, and enforce policies. Meanwhile, the new [GitHub Code Quality](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-github-code-quality-in-public-preview/) (in public preview) provides in-context findings, maintainability scores, and one-click fixes—helping teams ensure their code is healthy, maintainable, and reliable.\n\nWith all these rapidly advancing new capabilities, now is the ideal moment to move your repositories to GitHub so your teams can fully harness Copilot’s agentic power while still benefiting from your existing investments in Azure Boards and Pipelines. The two platforms continue to work better together, and choosing GitHub as the home for your code unlocks the richest end-to-end agentic experience.\n\n## A smoother, supported migration path\n\nFor most repositories, the migration is straightforward using [GitHub Enterprise Importer](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud). There is a detailed [migration guide](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/ado/about-migrations-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud) you can leverage as well. If you’d like hands-on help, GitHub Expert Services and our partner ecosystem are ready to assist. And with GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency, customers in the US, Europe, and Australia can keep data co-located across both GitHub and Azure DevOps.\n\n## Deepening integrations with Azure DevOps and GitHub Repositories\n\nWe’re deepening the seamless integration between Azure DevOps and GitHub to drive the next era of developer productivity. Azure Boards now supports assigning work directly to the GitHub Coding Agent, currently in preview and slated for general availability in December. This capability bridges planning and execution, allowing teams to harness Copilot’s agentic power for automated coding tasks, spec-driven development, and faster delivery—all while maintaining the governance and traceability you expect from Azure DevOps.\n\n[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/11/coding-agent-demo-2.mp4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/11/coding-agent-demo-2.mp4)\n\nAdditionally, the [Azure DevOps MCP Server](https://github.com/mcp/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp) is now generally available, unlocking an even broader set of agentic capabilities. With Copilot, you can reprioritize your backlog based on defined criteria, standardize and improve your Epics, troubleshoot failed builds, or generate comprehensive Test Plans. The opportunities to accelerate productivity and improve quality are virtually limitless.\n\nAnd don’t forget – [Azure DevOps Basic access rights are included with every GitHub Enterprise license](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-devops-basic-usage-included-with-github-enterprise/), so your teams can continue using Boards and Pipelines without additional cost.\n\n## Still on Azure Repos? Copilot meets you where you are\n\nEven if your repositories stay in Azure Repos, you can still take advantage of GitHub Copilot’s expanding agentic capabilities. With Visual Studio 2026, these capabilities are built directly into the IDE—no matter where your code lives—so you can get the same agent-driven workflows, AI-assisted code reviews, [adaptive paste](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/effortless-adjustments-with-an-adaptive-paste/), and profiling agent tools without migrating to GitHub. In both Visual Studio and VS Code, Copilot can automate a wide range of tasks, including writing code, generating tests, creating documentation, modernizing applications, deploying to Azure through Azure MCP Server, and managing pull requests and Azure DevOps workflows.\n\nWe’ve also streamlined how you provision and manage access. The new billing and licensing experience lets you assign Copilot licenses directly, whether users work in Azure Repos, GitHub, or both, without splitting organizations or going through a sales-assisted process.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThese enhancements make it easier than ever for teams to collaborate, automate, and accelerate workflows. By moving your repositories to GitHub, you can fully unlock GitHub’s Agentic capabilities while continuing to leverage Azure Boards and Pipelines. With enterprise-grade governance, including centralized license management, data residency, and role-based access in GitHub, your organization can innovate securely and confidently.\n\nNow is the time to migrate your repos and take full advantage of a platform that combines intelligent automation, seamless integrations, and enterprise-ready controls—all in one place."
