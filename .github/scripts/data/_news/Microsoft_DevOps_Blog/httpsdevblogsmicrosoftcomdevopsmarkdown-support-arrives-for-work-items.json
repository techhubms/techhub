  "EnhancedContent": "After several months in private preview and many bug fixes along the way, we‚Äôre excited to announce that Markdown support in large text fields is now generally available! üéâ\n\n# ü¶Ñ How it works\n\nBy default, all existing and new work items will continue using the HTML editor for large text fields. However, you now have the option to opt-in and use the Markdown editor for individual work items and fields.\n\n### Existing work items\n\nOpen the work item and click into a large text field (e.g., Description). The field will initially appear as an HTML editor, but you‚Äôll now see an option to convert it to Markdown.\n\n[![Image showing convert field to markdown](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABy8AAAIwAQMAAAAFzbULAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAlElEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQsvoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAeBj5XwABx+UWQgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/markdown-2.png)\n\nWe perform a best-effort conversion of the HTML to Markdown.\n\n[![Image showing conversion confirmation](data:image/png;base64,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)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/markdown-3.png)\n\nKeep in mind, the more complex the HTML, the harder it is to accurately convert it. If your field contains intricate formatting, we recommend keeping it in HTML.\n\n> >\n> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**\n> > >\n> Once you convert a field to Markdown, there‚Äôs no way to revert it back to HTML.\n> >\n\nAfter the conversion takes place, the work item will display the text in Markdown format whenever you edit it.\n\n[![Image showing markdown editor](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABzYAAANeAQMAAABK/3q3AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAA2UlEQVR4nO3BgQAAAADDoPlTH+ECVQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAzwANXQABKjWNvAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/markdown-4.png)\n\nYou can also toggle a preview mode to see how your Markdown renders in real time.\n\n[![Image showing markdown preview button](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABz0AAAM9AQMAAAA8f/y0AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAA0klEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ43oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACODPKjAAElWGOnAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/markdown-5.png)\n\n### New work items\n\nFor new work items, the experience is similar, except there is no existing data to convert.\n\nAlso, your editor preference is sticky. Meaning, if you choose Markdown for a new work item, we‚Äôll remember your preference, and all future work items you create will default to Markdown.\n\nIf you prefer HTML for a particular field, you can select it, as long as the field is still empty.\n\n[![Image showing new work item with switch to markdown](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAB2oAAAKXAQMAAAB5R1i5AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAsElEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQZ/oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOAwaxcAATSXJwUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/markdown-6.png)\n\nOnce a field is being used in Markdown mode, the HTML editor is no longer available. However, if you paste HTML into the editor, we‚Äôll attempt to automatically convert it to Markdown.\n\n# üßë‚Äçüíª Using REST APIs\n\nWhen creating a work item through the REST API‚Äôs the default format for any large text field will remain HTML. However, you can set the format to Markdown by adding an additional operation to your patch document. Here is an example to set the `System.Description` field to `Markdown` :\n\n``` { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/fields/System.Description\", \"value\": \"# some markdown text\" }, { \"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/multilineFieldsFormat/System.Description\", \"value\": \"Markdown\" },\n\n```\n\nThe `/multilineFieldsFormat` setting can be used with any large text field to enable Markdown formatting.\n\nHere are the key rules when using the REST API:\n\n- The default format is `HTML`\n- Once a work item is saved with `Markdown`\n, it cannot be reverted back to `HTML` , just like in the UI\n- This setting only applies to large text fields such as Description, Repro Steps, and Acceptance Criteria. Custom large text fields are also supported\n\n# üöÄ Release process\n\nAs part of our improved release process, we‚Äôve introduced additional checks to ensure a smooth rollout, which means it may take a bit longer to reach everyone.\n\nThe rollout began this week with the first group of customers. We typically allow a few days between each wave to monitor for any issues before proceeding to the next group. The rollout is divided into five stages (which we call ‚Äúrings‚Äù), and we expect the full deployment to all organizations to take approximately 4 to 5 weeks.\n\n# üí¨ Feedback\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new Markdown support for large text fields in work items. If you have feedback or encounter any issues, please don‚Äôt hesitate to [submit a ticket](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/AzureDevOps). Our team actively monitors incoming reports and will respond accordingly.",
