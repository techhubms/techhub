  "EnhancedContent": "Azure DevOps will no longer depend on the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) resource (https://management.azure.com) when you sign in or refresh Microsoft Entra access tokens. Previously, Azure DevOps required the ARM audience during sign-in and token refresh flows. This requirement meant administrators had to allow all Azure DevOps users to satisfy ARM-based [Conditional Access policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/conditional-access-policies) to maintain access to ADO.\n\nTokens for Azure DevOps no longer require the ARM audience. As a result, you can manage Azure DevOps access more effectively by creating Azure DevOps-specific Conditional Access policy instead of relying on the ARM Conditional Access policy to enforce access controls on ADO usage. **These changes will go into effect on July 28, 2025 September 2, 2025.**\n\n## Does this impact me?\n\nIf you have previously set up a Conditional Access policy for [Windows Azure Service Management API application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps#windows-azure-service-management-api), this Conditional Access policy no longer covers Azure DevOps signins. You will need to setup a new ADO-exclusive Conditional Access policy in order to get continued coverage of Azure DevOps.\n\n## How do I set up a Conditional Access policy for Azure DevOps?\n\nAs a tenant admin, you can use [Conditional Access policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview) to block or grant user access to Azure resources if they meet certain conditions (e.g. have an accepted IP address, belong to specific Entra groups, access from a given device, etc.) or complete actions like multifactor authentication.\n\nTo create a conditional access policy that targets the Azure DevOps resource specifically:\n\n1. Go to the [**Azure Portal**](https://portal.azure.com) and find the **“Microsoft Entra Conditional Access”** service.\n2. Select **“Policies”** on the right sidebar.\n3. Select the **“+ New policy”** button.\n4. Provide the policy a name and configure other settings as desired.\n5. For the **“Target resources”** assignments, toggle **“Select resources”** and add the **“Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services”** or **“Azure DevOps”** resource (resource id: `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798`\n) to the list of target resources.\n6. Select **Save** to apply this new policy.\n\n[![Setup a new conditional access policy for Azure DevOps](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/06/image-16.png)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/06/image-16.png)\n\nLearn more about the different flavors of Conditional Access policies you can set by reading the [Microsoft Entra docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/).\n\n### Notable exceptions\n\nContinued access to ARM is still required for the following Azure DevOps users:\n\n- **Billing administrators** need access to ARM to set up billing and access subscriptions.\n- **Service Connection creators** require access to ARM for ARM role assignments and updates to managed service identities (MSIs).",
