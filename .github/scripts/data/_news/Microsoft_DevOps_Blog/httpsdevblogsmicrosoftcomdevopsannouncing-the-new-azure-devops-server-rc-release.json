You can‚ÄØ[download Azure DevOps Server RC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/download/azuredevopsserver?view=azure-devops#download-the-latest-release) today. A direct upgrade to Azure DevOps Server RC is supported from any version of Team Foundation Server, including Team Foundation Server 2015 and newer.\n\n> >\n> **Note:** October 14, 2025, is the date for the end of Extended Support for Team Foundation Server 2015. This means that it will no longer receive security updates or technical support. We strongly recommend that customers upgrade to the latest versions of Azure DevOps as they are released. Direct upgrade from this RC release to the eventual RTM will be supported. If you prefer to wait until RTM to upgrade your servers, trying out this RC on a test deployment is a great first step.\n> >\n\n**üöÄ What‚Äôs New in Azure DevOps Server RC**\n\nSome of the new features delivered with this release include:\n\n- [TFX validates whether a task is using an End of Life Node runner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/release-notes/azuredevopsserver?view=azure-devops#tfx-validates-whether-a-task-is-using-an-end-of-life-node-runner)\n- [Restore deleted test plans and test suites using REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/release-notes/azuredevopsserver?view=azure-devops#restore-deleted-test-plans-and-test-suites-using-rest-api)\n\nYou can read more details about these and all the new features in the [release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/release-notes/azuredevopsserver?view=azure-devops).\n\n**üì¢What‚Äôs Changing with this release**\n\n**Lifecycle Policy:** With this release, Azure DevOps Server is transitioning from the Fixed Lifecycle Policy to the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://aka.ms/modernlifecyclepolicy). This change will align Azure DevOps Server with other Microsoft products offering a more flexible and future-ready experience.\n\n**Branding:** We‚Äôre making a subtle change to how we brand the product; with Azure DevOps Server we‚Äôre removing the year from the name. Going forward, it‚Äôs simply ‚ÄúAzure DevOps Server‚Äù.\n\nPreviously, we‚Äôve included the release year in the product name to help customers track major updates. However, this approach has led to confusion. Customers often ask whether a version labeled with a past year is still supported or current, even when it includes the latest fixes. By removing the year:\n\n- We will simplify the branding and align it with our continuous delivery model.\n- We emphasize that Azure DevOps Server is a living product, evolving with improvements and security updates.\n\n**üîÅWhat Stays the same**\n\nWe‚Äôll continue to provide security updates for previously released versions until they reach the end of Extended Support. If we ever decide to retire Azure DevOps Server, we‚Äôll provide at least a 3-year advanced notification per our [Modern Support Lifecycle commitments](https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/3-year-subset) so that customers can take action to prevent disruption.\n\n‚ú®Upgrade to the latest release today to enjoy new features! We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, let us know any feedback or questions via the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/AzureDevOpsServerTFS) and stay tuned for more updates. As always, thank you for your partnership as we continue to evolve Azure DevOps Server to meet your needs.\n\n**Frequently Asked Questions:**\n\n**Q:** What is changing with this release of Azure DevOps Server?\n\nA: For the first time, Azure DevOps Server is being released under Microsoft‚Äôs Modern Lifecycle Policy. This means continuous support for customers who stay current with updates and meet servicing and system requirements, rather than a fixed end-of-support date.\n\n**Q:** Will there still be major version releases?\n\nA: No. Under the Modern Lifecycle Policy, Azure DevOps Server will no longer have major version releases every two years. Instead, updates will be delivered more frequently to a single, ongoing version of the product.\n\n**Q:** How will the product be branded going forward?\n\nA: The year will be dropped from the product name. The product will simply be called ‚ÄúAzure DevOps Server‚Äù.\n\n**Q:** How does this affect licensing?\n\nA: Customers can continue to license Azure DevOps Server through Azure (monthly) or via authorized resellers. Customers who buy through Azure can use both the hosted and server versions. Visual Studio subscribers will continue to receive one server license plus one user per month. You can learn more about Azure DevOps Server pricing [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/server/?msockid=33e827d02f2c65b624e432212eb064f9).\n\n**Q:** Will support for older versions change?\n\nA: Microsoft will continue to provide security updates for previously released versions until they reach the end of Extended Support under the Fixed Lifecycle Policy. Purchasing Software Assurance does not extend support for older versions.\n\n**Q:** What happens if Microsoft decides to retire Azure DevOps Server?\n\nA: If support for Azure DevOps Server is ever ended, Microsoft will provide a notification to allow customers time to transition.\n\n**Q:** Can customers migrate to Azure DevOps Services in the cloud from the new version?\n\nA: Yes. Staying current with the latest version of Azure DevOps Server will make it easier for organizations to migrate to Azure DevOps Services in the cloud when they are ready.\n\n**Q:** How will support teams identify which version a customer is using if there is no year in the product name?\n\nA: Support teams will use the file version number to identify the specific build a customer is running.",
