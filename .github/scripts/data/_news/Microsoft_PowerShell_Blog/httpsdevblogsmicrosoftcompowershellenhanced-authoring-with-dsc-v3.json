DSC validates these data files using a JSON schema. While the DSC schemas are useful for authoring, DSC also includes a set of enhanced schemas for authoring the files in VS Code.\n\nThese schemas define extra keywords specific to VS Code that:\n\n- Improve the contextual help when hovering on or selecting a property in the data file.\n- Add contextual help for enum values.\n- Improve the error messages for invalid values.\n- Add default snippets to autocomplete values.\n\nTo learn more, see [Authoring with Enhanced Schemas](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/concepts/enhanced-authoring?view=dsc-3.0&amp;preserveView=true).\n\n## Authoring with Bicep (Coming soon!)\n\n[Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) is Microsoft’s domain specific language (DSL) for creating declarative Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployments. It offers a clean, intuitive syntax that makes writing and maintaining DSC configurations more efficient. By using Bicep as a DSL, DSC users enjoy the benefits of strong validation, modularity, and seamless integration with Azure-native tooling, without the complexity of authoring in JSON or YAML.\n\nYou can write and invoke Bicep configurations locally–without access to Azure–or as part of your Azure deployments, combining Infrastructure as code (IaC) and Configuration as code (CaC).\n\nThe following Bicep configuration document calls the classic PowerShell resource `WindowsFeature`\n\nfrom the **PSDesiredStateConfiguration** module to install the IIS web server feature on Windows Server.\n\n```bicep targetScope = 'dsc' resource powershellAdapter 'Microsoft.Windows/WindowsPowerShell@2025-01-07' = { name: 'Web server install' properties: { resources: [ { name: 'Run WindowsFeature' type: 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration/WindowsFeature' properties: { Name: 'Web-server' Ensure: 'Present' } } ] } } ```\n\nBy default, a Bicep file is scoped to a Bicep resource. To use Bicep with DSC, you must set the scope to `dsc` . Bicep support is still being developed. We’ll make an announcement when Bicep support and documentation is available.\n\n## Call to action\n\nFor more information about DSC v3.0, see the [DSCv3 documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/dsc/overview?view=dsc-3.0&amp;preserveView=true).
