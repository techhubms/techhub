This post gives some background on Microsoft Update, explains our update rules, and announces our plans for updating your installs of PowerShell 7.2.\n\n## About Microsoft Update\n\nMicrosoft Update (MU) is a service that provides automatic updates for Microsoft products and services. We first started using MU in PowerShell 7.2. MU provides a convenient way to automatically update PowerShell 7, which ensures you can control your update schedule, test it against your environment, and scale across your enterprise with ease.\n\n### Enabling MU\n\nDuring MSI installation, two checkboxes control update settings:\n\n- **Enable updates for PowerShell through Microsoft Update or WSUS (recommended)**Allows the system to receive updates for PowerShell 7 through Microsoft Update, Windows Server\nUpdate Services (WSUS), or System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).\n- **Enable Microsoft Update when I check for updates (recommended)**Permits the system to receive updates for all supported Microsoft software, not just Windows.\n\nWe recommend that you select both options to ensure comprehensive update coverage.\n\nIf you want to set these options while installing PowerShell from the command line, you can find detailed instructions in the [PowerShell documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows#install-the-msi-package-from-the-command-line).\n\n### Update Availability\n\nAfter we release a new PowerShell version, it can take up to two weeks before the update is available through Microsoft Update. We strive to publish the update no later than 2 weeks after the GitHub release, but there is no guarantee. There may be circumstances that delay the update. If you need the update before it’s available via MU, you can download it directly from the [PowerShell Releases](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/) page on GitHub.\n\n## What is the expected behavior of MU?\n\nWe defined the rules for updates in an intentional way to ensure that users who are using LTS versions stay on LTS versions. This means that you might not be updated to the latest version of PowerShell 7 when you expected.\n\nThese are the rules for updates:\n\n- If you are running 7.4 (LTS), you will receive updates to 7.4 (LTS)\n- If you are running 7.5 (stable), you will receive updates to 7.5 (stable)\n- If you are running any preview or release candidate (rc) version, you will receive updates to next\nlatest preview version as they come out.\n\nWe will never update an LTS version to a stable non-LTS version, like 7.4 to 7.5. However, a stable non-LTS release **WILL** be upgraded to the higher LTS release when support for the stable release ends. The only time we update an LTS version to a different version would be when an LTS version is out of support. For example, we will update 7.4 to 7.6 (next LTS) once 7.4 goes out of support.\n\nPreview versions will never be updated to the latest stable version. Instead, we will update you to the latest preview release. This means if you are on 7.5-rc.1 you will be updated to 7.6-preview.2 (since preview.1 was skipped) instead of 7.5.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nBeginning **March 14, 2025**, we will be updating users who are on 7.2 to 7.4.\n\n## Helpful Links\n\nHopefully this post helps you understand the MU process.

You can provide feedback via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/).\n\nThank you so much!\n\nSteven Bucher\n\nPM on the PowerShell Team",
