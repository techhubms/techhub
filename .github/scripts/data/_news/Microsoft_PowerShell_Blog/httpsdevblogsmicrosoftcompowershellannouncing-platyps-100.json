[Markdown](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is widely used in the software industry, supported by many editors including **Visual Studio Code**, and easier to author.\n\nWith this release, **Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS** is the supported tool. This release is a substantial rewrite with all new cmdlets. **platyPS v0.14.2** is no longer supported. We encourage all users to upgrade to **Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS** for the latest features, performance improvements, and ongoing support. If you have scripts that use the older version of **platyPS**, you must rewrite them to use the new cmdlets.\n\n**Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS** includes several improvements:\n\n- Re-write in C# leveraging [markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) for parsing Markdown (the same library used by\nMicrosoft Learn to render Markdown)\n- Provides a more accurate description of a PowerShell cmdlet and its parameters and includes\ninformation that was previously unavailable\n- Creates an object model of the help file that you can manipulate and supports chaining cmdlets for\ncomplex operations\n- Increased performance – processes 1000s of Markdown files in seconds\n\n**Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS** runs on:\n\n- Windows PowerShell 5.1+\n- PowerShell 7+ on Windows, Linux, and macOS\n\n## Installing Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS\n\nTo begin working with **Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS 1.0.0**, install the module from PSGallery.\n\n```powershell Install-PSResource -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS ```\n\n## Documentation to get started\n\nFor this release, the cmdlet reference is available at [Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.platyps). For an example of how to use the new cmdlets, see *Example #1* in [New-MarkdownCommandHelp](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.platyps/new-markdowncommandhelp#example-1-create-markdown-help-files-for-a-module).\n\n## Call to action\n\nOur goal is to make it easier for you to update and maintain PowerShell help files. We value your feedback. Stop by our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) and let us know of any issues you find.\n\nInterested in contributing to the PlatyPS project? We welcome feature ideas and contributions. Please follow the contribution guidance in the [Github Readme](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS/blob/main/README.md).\n\nJason Helmick\n\nSr. Product Manager, PowerShell",
