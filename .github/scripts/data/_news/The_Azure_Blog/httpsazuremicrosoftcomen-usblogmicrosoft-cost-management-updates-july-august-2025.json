Nobody wants a surprise bill—and that’s where Microsoft Cost Management comes in.\n\nWhether you’re a new student, a thriving startup, or the largest enterprise, you have financial constraints. You need to know what you’re spending, where your money is being spent, and how to plan for the future. Nobody wants a surprise bill—and that’s where [Microsoft Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cost-management/) comes in. We’re always looking for ways to learn more about your challenges and help you do more with less.\n\n[See the newest features on Microsoft Cost Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cost-management/)\n\nHere are a few of the latest improvements and updates (July 2025):\n\n- Service Principal support for Partner Admin Reader role (EA indirect partners)\n- Azure Pricing Calculator: Tip of the Month\n- New ways to save money with Microsoft Cloud\n- New videos and learning opportunities\n- Documentation updates\n\nLet’s dig into the details.\n\n## Service Principal support for Partner Admin Reader role (EA indirect partners)\n\nWe’re excited to announce that Azure now supports assigning the Partner Admin Reader role to Service Principals. This enhancement empowers Enterprise Agreement indirect partners (CSPs who manage customer Azure costs) to programmatically access cost data across their customers’ enrollments under their Partner Customer Number (PCN) via Azure Active Directory applications—without relying on interactive user accounts.\n\n**Why this matters**:\n\nManaging cloud costs across multiple customers is complex and might be error-prone when relying on manual exports or shared credentials. Partners need secure, scalable, and automated access to cost data to integrate insights into their tools and optimize spend in real time.\n\nWith these enhancements, partners can now:\n\n- Automate cost data retrieval securely using Azure Active Directory service principals (no shared user credentials).\n- Integrate Cost Management data into partner billing tools, dashboards, or workflows using APIs.\n- Maintain strong governance and control access to billing scopes with Azure Role-Based Access Control.\n- Enable near real-time monitoring, invoice reconciliation, and proactive cost optimization across multiple customers.\n\nTo get started, [learn more about how to assign Enterprise Agreement roles to service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/assign-roles-azure-service-principals).\n\n## Azure Pricing Calculator: Tip of the Month\n\nWhen working with estimates in the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/)—that include multiple services—scrolling through all the details can become overwhelming. To simplify your view, **click the collapse button** on your estimate. This instantly minimizes the detailed configuration for all services in your estimate, leaving just the summary line visible. ![A view of the pricing calculator showing an estimate titled 'My Azure Workload' and the header of the Virtual Machines service. A blue collapse button is highlighted in the top right corner of the image.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/word-image-45866-1.png)\n\n**Why this helps:**\n\n- Reduces unnecessary scrolling when managing large estimates.\n- Makes it easier to focus on the services you want to review or adjust.\n- Keeps your workspace clean and organized, especially when sharing estimates with others.\n\nTry collapsing services the next time you build a complex estimate. It’s a small trick that makes a big difference in navigating your pricing scenarios!\n\n## New ways to save money with Microsoft Cloud\n\nHere are new and updated offers you might be interested in for cost savings and optimization from July and August 2025:\n\n- **Generally available:** [Azure Firewall ingestion-time transformation for cost-efficient logging](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=498568). Now you can filter or transform Azure Firewall logs before they’re ingested into Log Analytics, reducing the amount of data stored and lowering your logging costs without losing critical security insights.\n\n- **Public preview:** [Azure Storage Mover–free Amazon Web Services S3-to-Azure Blob migration](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=497461). Now you can move data from Amazon Web Services S3 to Azure Blob Storage securely and at no additional cost using Azure Storage Mover. This fully managed service simplifies multi-cloud or full migration scenarios without third-party tools, reducing complexity and expenses.\n\n## New videos and learning opportunities\n\nWe added several new videos for your viewing and learning.
