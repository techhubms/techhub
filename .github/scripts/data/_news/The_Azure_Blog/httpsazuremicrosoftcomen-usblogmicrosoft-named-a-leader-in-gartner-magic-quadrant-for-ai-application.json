This leadership reflects a long‑term conviction: the next wave of applications is agentic, and real customer impact requires far more than great demos. Organizations need agents grounded in real data and tools, capable of driving business workflows, and governed with end‑to‑end observability at scale. Our investment in agent frameworks, orchestration, and enterprise‑grade governance is how we make that full journey real and practical for every customer.\n\n![Figure 1: Magica Quadrant for AI Application Development Platforms](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpeg)\n\n[Read the full Gartner report](https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2MD44GP0&amp;ct=251125&amp;st=sb)\n\n## Why we believe this matters\n\nGartner evaluates vendors on two dimensions: **Completeness of Vision** (where the platform is headed) and **Ability to Execute** (whether it can deliver today). Being positioned furthest on vision isn’t about having the boldest roadmap: it’s about whether that vision translates into the real capabilities customers need for the future of AI.\n\n**[Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/?msockid=1ecb0104704a6d1e271f17bb718a6cc9)** is our unified platform for building, deploying and governing AI applications—and over the past year, we’ve focused it on four areas that customers tell us separate production AI from proof-of-concept:\n\n- **Real data, real tools**. Agents are only as useful as what they can access. **[Foundry IQ](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-iq-unlocking-ubiquitous-knowledge-for-agents/4470812)** provides a single secure grounding API that connects agents to enterprise data, while **[Foundry Tools](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/tools)** offers over 1,400 pre-built connectors for document processing, translation, speech, and business systems.\n- **Workflow integration, not just conversation**. The shift from chatbot to agent means moving from Q&A to action. [**Foundry Agent Service**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/agent-service/) supports multi-agent orchestration where agents can handle off tasks, coordinate decisions, and drive end to end business processes: deployable directly into **Copilot** or your applications.\n- **Observability and governance at scale**. When agents act autonomously, you need to see what they’re doing and why. [**Foundry Control Plane**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-control-plane-where-developers-build-operate-and-govern-every-agent/4467885) provides organization-wide visibility, audit trails, and policy enforcement. “Trust but verify” doesn’t scale without tooling.\n- **Models from cloud to edge**. Build and run AI models wherever your workloads live—from cloud to edge. Fine-tune and deploy models from **[Foundry Models](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/models/?msockid=226aae8072256d8e10eabb6d73f96c50)** using enterprise-grade GenAI Ops, then run them on-device with [**Foundry Local**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/unlock-instant-on-device-ai-with-foundry-local/) for low-latency, offline, or regulated scenarios.\n\nWith these pillars in place, Foundry delivers everything organizations need to build AI applications and multi-agent systems at scale. That’s why we’ve ensured it works seamlessly with the tools developers and businesses use most. Foundry integrates deeply with development tools including Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Azure, and productivity tools such as Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, and the broader enterprise stack.\n\n[Explore Microsoft Foundry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooZ3xXEdOKI)\n\n## Walking the talk: Our agent-driven approach\n\nThis year, Microsoft adopted a fundamentally new approach for preparing our submission for AI Application Development Platforms. Instead of relying on manual data gathering and coordination, our team developed custom agents designed to collect, organize, and validate all the information required for the evaluation.\n\n**How the agent was created:**\n\nThe agent’s development is detailed in a [recent blog post](https://aka.ms/Gartner-AgentTechComm-blog), which outlines the technical architecture and methodology behind its creation. Built using Microsoft Agent Framework, our open-source offering, the agents leverage advanced orchestration capabilities and multimodal content processing. It was designed to automate the complex process of assembling submission data, ensuring accuracy and completeness while reducing manual effort.\n\n**Technical highlights:**\n\nThe agent uses a structured prompt and workflow, [as specified here](https://github.com/mcasalaina/QuestionnaireAgent_v2/blob/main/Questionnaire_UI_Agent_spec.md). It integrates with Microsoft Foundry platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model, supporting both pay-as-you-go and provisioned throughput options.\n\n**Benefits of the agent-driven process:**\n\nBy automating the submission workflow, the agent improved data accuracy and transparency, allowing our experts to focus on strategic insights rather than manual compilation. The process was more efficient, reduced the risk of errors, and ensured that our submission was both comprehensive and up to date.\n\nThis innovation reflects Microsoft’s commitment to technical excellence and continuous improvement, providing customers with greater confidence in the quality and reliability of its AI solutions. By streamlining critical processes, Microsoft delivers more accurate, transparent, and timely updates, enabling organizations to make informed decisions and accelerate innovation with enterprise-grade AI platforms that maintain compliance and security standards.\n\n## Empowering organizations with Microsoft Foundry\n\nWe believe our recognition in the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for AI Application Development Platforms is a testament to Microsoft’s commitment to empowering organizations to develop robust, scalable, and intelligent AI solutions.
