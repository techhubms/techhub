Here is a recap of those releases and advancements.\n\n## Innovating for the future with AI\n\n**[Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/?msockid=0d36bfb9b86d68ee3afdae84b944695f)** provides a unified storage foundation for the entire AI lifecycle, powering everything from ingestion and preparation to checkpoint management and model deployment.\n\nTo enable customers to rapidly train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models, we evolved the Azure Blob Storage architecture to scale and deliver **exabytes** of capacity, **10s of Tbps** throughput, and millions of IOPS to GPUs. In this [video](https://youtu.be/CmihM2eVtlQ?si=nBXXshzFm6R4AiiK&amp;t=1843), you can see a single storage account scaling to over **50 Tbps** on read throughput. Azure Blob Storage is also the foundation that enables [OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/unleash-your-creativity-at-scale-azure-ai-foundrys-multimodal-revolution/) to train and serve models at unprecedented speed and scale.\n\n![](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-13-1024x293.webp)*Fig 1. Storage-centric view of AI training and fine-tuning*\n\nFor customers handling terabyte or petabyte scale AI training data, **[Azure Managed Lustre (AMLFS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-managed-lustre/amlfs-overview)** is a high-performance parallel file system delivering massive throughput and parallel I/O to keep GPUs continuously fed with data. [AMLFS 20 (preview)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/AzureHighPerformanceComputingBlog/announcing-the-public-preview-of-amlfs-20-azure-managed-lustre-new-sku-for-massi/4470665) supports **25 PiB** namespaces and up to **512 GBps** throughput. Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) integration enhances AMLFS scalability by enabling seamless data movement between AMLFS and your exabyte-scale datasets in Azure Blob Storage. [Auto-import](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=529342) (preview) allows you to pull only required datasets into AMLFS, and auto-export sends trained models to long-term storage or inferencing.\n\n> >\n> *Rakuten is accelerating the training of Japanese large language models on Microsoft Azure, leveraging Azure Managed Lustre, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Kubernetes Service to maximize GPU utilization and simplify scaling.*\n> >\n> Natalie Mao, VP, AI & Data Division, Rakuten Group\n\nOnce models are trained and fine-tuned, inferencing takes center stage delivering real-time predictions and insights. Azure Blob Storage provides best-in-class storage for Microsoft AI services, including [Microsoft Foundry Agent Knowledge](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-iq-unlocking-ubiquitous-knowledge-for-agents/4470812) (preview) and [AI Search retrieval agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-knowledge-source-how-to-blob?pivots=python) (preview), enabling customers to bring their own storage accounts for full flexibility and control, ensuring that enterprise data remains secure and ready for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\nAdditionally, Premium Blob Storage delivers consistent low-latency and up to 3X faster retrieval performance, critical for RAG agents. For customers that prefer open-source AI frameworks, Azure Storage built **** [LangChain Azure Blob Loader](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuredevcommunityblog/introducing-langchain-azure-storage-azure-storage-integrations-for-langchain/4465268) which delivers granular security, memory-efficient loading of millions of objects and up to 5x faster performance compared to prior community implementations.\n\n![](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image1-1024x330.webp)*Fig 2. Storage-centric view of AI inference with enterprise data*\n\nAzure Storage is evolving to be an integrated, intelligent AI-driven platform simplifying management of exabyte-scale AI data. **Storage Discovery** and **Copilot** work together to help you analyze and understand how your data estate is evolving over time using dashboards and questions in natural language. With [Storage Discovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-storage-discovery-transform-data-management-with-storage-insights/?msockid=0d36bfb9b86d68ee3afdae84b944695f) and [Storage Actions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/unlock-seamless-data-management-with-azure-storage-actions-now-generally-available/?msockid=0d36bfb9b86d68ee3afdae84b944695f), you can optimize costs, protect your data and govern large datasets with hundreds of billions of objects used for training, and fine-tuning.\n\n## Optimizing modern applications with Cloud Native\n\nModern cloud-native applications demand agility. Two principles consistently stand out: elasticity and flexibility. Your storage should scale seamlessly with dynamic workloads—without operational overhead. The innovations below are designed for the cloud, enabling you to auto-scale, optimize costs intelligently, and deliver the performance needed by modern applications.\n\n[**Azure Elastic SAN**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-introduction) provides cloud-native block storage for scale and tight Kubernetes integration for fast scaling, and multi‑tenancy that optimizes cost. With new [auto scaling support](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/elastic-san/elastic-san-expand), Elastic SAN automatically expands resources as needed, making it easier to manage storage footprints across workloads. Early next year, we’ll extend Kubernetes integration via Azure Container Storage for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to general availability (GA). These enhancements let you maintain familiar hosting environments while layering in cloud-native capabilities.\n\nCloud-native agility is also critical for modern applications built on object storage, with the need to optimize costs and performance for dynamic and unpredictable traffic patterns. [Smart Tier](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurestorageblog/unlocking-storage-optimizations-smart-tiering-for-blobs-and-adls-in-azure-storag/4469811) (preview) on Azure Blob Storage continuously analyzes access patterns, moving data between tiers automatically.\n\nNew data starts in the hot tier. After 30 days of inactivity, it moves to cool, and after 90 days, to cold. If an object is accessed again, it’s promoted back to hot which keeps data in the most cost-effective tier automatically. You can optimize costs without sacrificing performance, simplifying data management at scale and keeping your focus on building.\n\n## Hosting mission-critical workloads\n\nEnterprises today run mission-critical workloads that require block storage and deliver predictable performance and uncompromising business continuity. **[Azure Ultra Disk](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/the-new-era-of-azure-ultra-disk-experience-the-next-generation-of-mission-critical-block-storage/)** is our highest-performance block storage offering, purpose-built for workloads like high-frequency trading, ecommerce platforms, transactional databases, and electronic health record systems that demand exceptional speed, reliability, and scalability.\n\n> >\n> *With Azure Ultra Disk, we can confidently scale our platform globally, knowing that performance and resilience will meet enterprise expectations, that consistency allows our teams to focus on AI innovation and workflow automation rather than infrastructure.*\n> >\n> Charles McDaniels, Director of Systems Engineering Management for Global Cloud Services, ServiceNow\n\nWe know performance, cost, and business continuity remain the top priorities for our customers and we are raising the bar in every category:\n\n- **Performance:** We have further improved the average latency for [Azure Ultra Disk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd?tabs=azure-portal) by 30% with average latency well under 0.5ms for small IOs on virtual machines (VMs) with [Azure Boost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-boost/overview). A single Azure Ultra Disk can deliver industry leading performance of 400K IOPS and 10 GBps throughput.
