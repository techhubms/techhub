Developers face fragmented tooling, and organizations struggle to ensure agents behave responsibly. Our latest updates to Azure AI Foundry address these challenges head-on.\n\n## Introducing Microsoft Agent Framework (public preview)\n\nThe [**Microsoft** **Agent Framework**](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/PuPr), now in public preview, is the open-source SDK and runtime that simplifies the orchestration of multi-agent systems. It converges [**AutoGen**](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), a former Microsoft Research project, and the enterprise-ready foundations of [**Semantic Kernel**](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) into a unified, commercial-grade framework—bringing cutting-edge research to developers.\n\n[Get started with the Microsoft Agent Framework](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/PuPr)\n\nWith Microsoft Agent Framework, developers can:\n\n- Experiment locally and then deploy to Azure AI Foundry with observability, durability, and compliance built in.\n- Integrate any API via OpenAPI, collaborate across runtimes with Agent2Agent (A2A), and connect to tools dynamically using Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n- Use the latest multi-agent patterns like Magentic One and orchestrate agents into Workflows.\n- Reduce context-switching across tools and platforms.\n- Build multi-agent systems connecting Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and other agent platforms.\n\nThis framework is designed to help developers stay in flow. According to an industry study2, **50% of developers lose more than 10 hours per week** due to inefficiencies like fragmented tools, highlighting the need for solutions that reduce complexity and improve the developer experience.\n\nOne organization using Microsoft Agent Framework to reduce friction is **KPMG**. KPMG’s transformation began with KPMG Clara, its cloud-based smart audit platform used on every KPMG audit worldwide.\n\nKPMG Clara AI is tightly aligned with the next-generation, open-source Microsoft Agent Framework, built on the convergence of Semantic Kernel and [AutoGen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen).\n\nThis means KPMG Clara AI can connect specialized agents to enterprise data and tools, while benefiting from built-in safeguards and an open, extensible developer ecosystem. The framework’s open-source connectors allow agents in KPMG Clara AI to interoperate not only with Azure AI Foundry, but also with external systems and language models, making it possible to [scale multi-agent collaboration across a global, regulated enterprise](https://aka.ms/kpmgagentframework).\n\n> >\n> Foundry Agent Service and Microsoft Agent Framework connect our agents to data and each other, and the governance and observability in Azure AI Foundry provide what KPMG firms need to be successful in a regulated industry.\n> >\n> *— Sebastian Stöckle, Global Head of Audit Innovation and AI at KPMG International*\n\nWe invite developers to join us in shaping the future of agentic AI by contributing code and feedback to Microsoft Agent Framework.\n\n## Multi-agent workflows (private preview)\n\nBuilding on Microsoft Agent Framework, we’re extending these capabilities directly into the cloud with **multi-agent workflows in Foundry Agent Service**. This new feature enables developers to orchestrate sophisticated, multi-step business processes using a structured, stateful workflow layer.\n\nWith multi-agent workflows, teams can:\n\n- Coordinate multiple agents across long-running tasks with persistent state and context sharing.\n- Automate complex enterprise scenarios such as customer onboarding, financial transaction processing, and supply chain automation.\n- Leverage built-in error handling, retries, and recovery to improve reliability at scale.\n\nWorkflows can be authored and debugged visually through the VS Code Extension or Azure AI Foundry, then deployed, tested, and managed in Foundry alongside existing solutions.\n\n![Azure A I Foundry interface showing a sequential workflow.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WorkflowBlogPostImage.webp)\n\nSeveral customers are currently experimenting with this capability, and we look forward to expanding to more customers in the coming weeks.\n\n## Multi-agent observability across popular frameworks with OpenTelemetry contributions\n\nWe’re also [announcing enhancements to **multi-agent observability**, with contributions to **OpenTelemetry**](https://aka.ms/MultiAgentTracingBlog) that help standardize tracing and telemetry for agentic systems.\n\nThis gives teams deeper visibility into agent workflows, tool call invocations, and collaboration—critical for debugging, optimization, and compliance. We made the above enhancements to OpenTelemetry in collaboration with Outshift, Cisco’s incubation engine.\n\nWith the above enhancements, Azure AI Foundry now provides **unified observability for agents built with multiple frameworks**, including Microsoft Agent Framework and others like LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI Agents SDK.\n\n## Voice Live API in Azure AI Foundry now generally available\n\nMutli-agent workflows are increasingly initiated through voice inputs and culminate in voice outputs. We’re excited to announce the [general availability](https://aka.ms/VoiceLiveGA) of Voice Live API, which empowers developers and enterprises to build scalable, production-ready voice AI agents. Voice Live API is a unified, real-time speech-to-speech interface that integrates **speech-to-text (STT)**, **generative AI models**, **text-to-speech (TTS)**, **avatar**, and **conversational enhancement** features into a single, low-latency pipeline.\n\nOrganizations such as **Capgemini**, **healow**, **Astra Tech**, and **Agora** are leveraging Voice Live API to build customer service agents, educational tutors, HR assistants, and multilingual agents. **Voice Live API** is transforming how developers build voice AI agents by providing an integrated, scalable, and efficient solution.\n\n## Responsible AI capabilities public preview\n\nBuilding on advancements in agent observability and framework integration, it’s equally important to ensure that AI systems operate responsibly and securely—especially as they become more deeply embedded in critical enterprise workflows.\n\nAccording to McKinsey’s 2025 Global AI Trust Survey3, the **number one barrier to AI adoption is lack of governance and risk-management tools**. That’s why we’re putting the following responsible AI features in public preview in the coming weeks:\n\n- **[Task adherence](https://aka.ms/TaskAdherence)**: Help agents stay aligned with assigned tasks.\n- **[Prompt shields with spotlighting](https://aka.ms/spotlighting)**: Protect against prompt injection and spotlight risky behavior.\n- **PII detection**: Identify and manage sensitive data.\n\nThese capabilities are built into Azure AI Foundry, helping organizations build with confidence and comply with internal and external standards.\n\n## Customer momentum\n\nAzure AI Foundry solutions are helping over **70,000 organizations** **worldwide**—from digital natives to enterprise companies—transform AI innovation into practical results.
