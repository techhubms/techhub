Whether your team responds with panic or calm depends on how well you’ve prepared. Fast recovery isn’t luck—it’s the result of intentional planning for resiliency by design.\n\nReliability means your cloud service works as expected, delivering consistent uptime and performance. Resiliency is your ability to quickly recover when things go wrong—like outages or disasters.\n\nReliability is the promise; building resiliency is how we keep that promise. Leading organizations build resiliency into their cloud solutions from the start, using zone-redundant architectures as a baseline and expanding to multi-region deployments for their most critical workloads.\n\n**Microsoft’s** [**Azure Essentials**](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/azure-essentials/) **is designed to make these practices accessible and actionable for every organization.**\n\n[What is Azure Essentials?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/azure-essentials/)\n\n## Shared responsibility\n\nReliability and resiliency in the cloud are achieved through a partnership between Microsoft and our customers. The shared responsibility model clarifies accountability by role:\n\n| **Area** | **Microsoft**<br><br><br><br>**(Platform reliability)** | **Customer/Partner**<br><br><br><br>**(Solution resiliency)** | | --- | --- | --- | | Global platform availability | [Delivers global infrastructure and uptime](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/) | N/A | | Foundational SLAs | [Guarantees service levels](https://www.azure.cn/en-us/support/sla/summary/) | N/A | | Solution architecture and SLOs | N/A | [Design and maintain solution-level objectives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/design-principles/build-for-business) | | Configuration, deployments, and operations | N/A | [Implement and manage deployments and operations](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/deployment-environments/?msockid=3e7053d124f16e2e0571473925db6fc9) | | Backup and disaster recovery | [Provides secure backup capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/security-overview) | [Develop and test recovery plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/recovery-plan-overview) | | Validation | [Offers platform validation tools](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/introducing-azure-app-testing-scalable-end-to-end-app-validation/4440496) | [Test solution’s ability to withstand failures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/testing-strategy) | | Governance and compliance | [Sets shared guardrails](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/dine-guidance) | [Enforce policies and compliance within environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/create-and-manage) |\n\n*Note: N/A indicates that the responsibility does not apply to that party.*\n\n### Real stories, real impact:\n\n[Publix Employees Federal Credit Union](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/24708-publix-employees-federal-credit-union-azure-migrate#:~:text=PEFCU%20reduced%20costs%2C%20simplified%20operations%2C%20and%20improved%20disaster,to%20focus%20on%20innovation%20and%20future%20cloud%20growth.?msockid=3e7053d124f16e2e0571473925db6fc9) leveraged Azure’s disaster recovery capabilities to minimize downtime during severe weather. The [University of Miami](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1452353711502789549-university-of-miami-higher-education-azure#:~:text=The%20University%20of%20Miami%20is%20a%20leading-edge%20teaching,part%20of%20a%20region%20known%20as%20Hurricane%20Alley.?msockid=3e7053d124f16e2e0571473925db6fc9) adopted availability zones and robust recovery strategies to ensure continuity for students and faculty. These stories show how platform reliability and customer resiliency combine for real-world results.\n\n## How Microsoft helps: Azure Essentials as the anchor\n\nAt the heart of Microsoft’s approach is [**Azure Essentials**](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/azure-essentials/)—the unified methodology that brings together all the tools, guidance, and best practices our customers need. Azure Essentials enables organizations to build resilient, reliable, and secure cloud solutions at every stage of their journey.\n\n### Azure Essentials brings together:\n\n- **Foundational blueprints:** [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) and [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) guidance to establish secure, cost-effective environments from day one.\n- **Actionable assessments:** [Optimization tools and gap analyses](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/finopsblog/get-tailored-insights-with-our-advisor-well-architected-assessments/4218239) for continuous improvement.\n- **Integrated tools:** [Validation with Azure Chaos Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/chaos-studio/chaos-studio-set-up-azure-monitor), monitoring with Azure Monitor, security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and automation with Azure DevOps.\n- **Resilient design patterns:** [Support for migration, modernization, AI innovation, and unified data platforms](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearchitectureblog/ai-powered-migration--modernization%E2%80%94secure-resilient-and-ready-for-innovation/4454849) with zone-redundant architectures and disaster recovery solutions.\n- **Continuous improvement:** [Ongoing validation, monitoring, and remediation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/monitoring-alerting-strategy) to maintain a strong resiliency posture.\n\n### Azure Essentials in action: Practical stages\n\n- **Start resilient:** Apply zone-redundant patterns, align security and governance, and embed resiliency early using [Azure Blueprints](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/blueprints/) and [reference architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/browse/).\n- **Get resilient:** Address gaps in existing deployments through assessments and targeted remediation plans and recommend high-availability strategies such as multi-region deployments.\n- **Stay resilient:** Implement continuous validation and improvement cycles, using telemetry, policy, and partner services to enforce resiliency posture.\n\nWith Azure Essentials, you’re not just preparing for the future—you’re helping to shape it, setting a new standard for resilient, always-on cloud innovation.\n\n### Resiliency across Azure solutions\n\nAzure Essentials empowers organizations to build resiliency into every Azure solution—whether you’re migrating workloads, innovating with AI, or unifying your data platform.
