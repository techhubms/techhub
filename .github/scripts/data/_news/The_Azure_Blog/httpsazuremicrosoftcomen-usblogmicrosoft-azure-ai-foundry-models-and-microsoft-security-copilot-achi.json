This certification underscores Microsoft’s commitment to building and operating AI systems responsibly, securely, and transparently. As responsible AI is rapidly becoming a business and regulatory imperative, this certification reflects how Microsoft enables customers to innovate with confidence.\n\n[Create with Azure AI Foundry Models](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-model-catalog)\n\n## Raising the bar for responsible AI with ISO/IEC 42001\n\n[ISO/IEC 42001](https://www.iso.org/standard/42001), developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), establishes a globally recognized framework for the management of AI systems. It addresses a broad range of requirements, from risk management and bias mitigation to transparency, human oversight, and organizational accountability. This international standard provides a certifiable framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an AI management system, supporting organizations in addressing risks and opportunities throughout the AI lifecycle.\n\nBy achieving this certification, Microsoft demonstrates that Azure AI Foundry Models, including Azure OpenAI models, and Microsoft Security Copilot prioritize responsible innovation and are validated by an independent third party. It provides our customers with added assurance that Microsoft Azure’s application of robust governance, risk management, and compliance practices across Azure AI Foundry Models and Microsoft Security Copilot are developed and operated in alignment with [Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard](https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/Microsoft-Responsible-AI-Standard-General-Requirements.pdf?culture=en-us&amp;country=us).\n\n## Supporting customers across industries\n\nWhether you are deploying AI in regulated industries, embedding generative AI into products, or exploring new AI use cases, this certification helps customers:\n\n- **Accelerate their own compliance journey** by leveraging certified AI services and inheriting governance controls aligned with emerging regulations.\n- **Build trust** with their own users, partners, and regulators through transparent, auditable governance evidenced with the AIMS certification for these services.\n- **Gain transparency into how Microsoft manages AI risks and governs responsible AI development, giving users greater confidence in the services they build on.**\n\n## Engineering trust and responsible AI into the Azure platform\n\nMicrosoft’s [Responsible AI (RAI) program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai) is the backbone of our approach to trustworthy AI and includes four core pillars—[Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/responsible-ai-transparency-report/)—which guides how we design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents. These principles are embedded into both Azure AI Foundry Models and Microsoft Security Copilot, resulting in services designed to be innovative, safe and accountable.\n\nWe are committed to delivering on our Responsible AI promise and continue to build on our existing work which includes:\n\n1. Our [AI Customer Commitments](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/08/announcing-microsofts-ai-customer-commitments/) to assist our customers on their responsible AI journey.\n2. Our inaugural [Responsible AI Transparency Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/responsible-ai-transparency-report/) that enables us to record and share our maturing practices, reflect on what we have learned, chart our goals, hold ourselves accountable, and earn the public’s trust.\n3. Our Transparency Notes for [Azure AI Foundry Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text) and [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/rai-faqs-security-copilot) help customers understand how our AI technology works, its capabilities and limitations, and the choices system owners can make that influence system performance and behavior.\n4. Our [Responsible AI res](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/tools-practices)[ources s](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/tools-practices)[ite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/tools-practices) which provides tools, practices, templates and information we believe will help many of our customers establish their responsible AI practices.\n\n## Supporting your responsible AI journey with trust\n\nWe recognize that responsible AI requires more than technology; it requires operational processes, risk management, and clear accountability. Microsoft supports customers in these efforts by providing both the platform and the expertise to operational trust and compliance. Microsoft remains steadfast in our commitment to the following:\n\n- Continually improving our AI management system.\n- Understanding the needs and expectations of our customers.\n- Building onto the Microsoft RAI program and AI risk management.\n- Identifying and actioning upon opportunities that allow us to build and maintain trust in our AI products and services.\n- Collaborating with the growing community of responsible AI practitioners, regulators, and researchers on advancing our responsible AI approach.\n\nISO/IEC 42001:2023 joins Microsoft’s extensive portfolio of compliance certifications, reflecting our dedication to operational rigor and transparency, helping customers build responsibly on a cloud platform designed for trust. From a healthcare organization striving for fairness to a financial institution overseeing AI risk, or a government agency advancing ethical AI practices, Microsoft’s certifications enable the adoption of AI at scale while aligning compliance with evolving global standards for security, privacy, and responsible AI governance.\n\nMicrosoft’s foundation in security and data privacy and our investments in operational resilience and responsible AI shows our dedication to earning and preserving trust at every layer. Azure is engineered for trust, powering innovation on a secure, resilient, and transparent foundation that gives customers the confidence to scale AI responsibly, navigate evolving compliance needs, and stay in control of their data and operations.\n\n## Learn more with Microsoft\n\nAs AI regulations and expectations continue to evolve, Microsoft remains focused on delivering a trusted platform for AI innovation, built with resiliency, security, and transparency at its core. ISO/IEC 42001:2023 certification is a critical step on that path, and Microsoft will continue investing in exceeding global standards and driving responsible innovations to help customers stay ahead—securely, ethically, and at scale.\n\nExplore how we put trust at the core of cloud innovation with our approach to security, privacy, and compliance at the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center).
