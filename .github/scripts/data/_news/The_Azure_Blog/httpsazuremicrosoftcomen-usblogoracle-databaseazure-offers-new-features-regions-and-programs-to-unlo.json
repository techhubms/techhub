  "EnhancedContent": "Oracle Database@Azure adds new AI-ready features, expands to 33 regions, and launches new partner and migration programs.\n\nTogether, Microsoft and Oracle are delivering the most comprehensive, enterprise‑ready platform for organizations migrating their Oracle solutions to the public cloud—especially those aiming to empower IT professionals and developers to streamline AI adoption and enhance employee productivity.\n\n[Oracle Database@Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/database-overview) was the first offering of its kind in the market and today has the broadest regional availability, new ways to unify your data in [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric), deeper security integrations with [Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender), and can run most Oracle Database services—Base Database Service, Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure, Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure and Autonomous Database as well as [Oracle Database 19c](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/oracleonazureblog/oracle-databaseazure-now-supports-oracle-database-19c-on-exadata-exascale-and-ne/4458643) or 23ai—on Azure.\n\n[Get started with Oracle Database@Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/oracle-database-get-started)\n\nThe result? A truly enterprise‑ready platform that offers more choice, increased control, and expanded opportunity to innovate with confidence–and customers are excited about the impact it’s driving in action.\n\n> >\n> Oracle Database@Azure delivered Exadata-grade performance natively within Azure, enabling us to host our Oracle EBS in the cloud without compromise. We gained native, real-time access to EBS data from Azure and seamless integration with both Oracle and non-Oracle data sources. Paired now with Microsoft Fabric, Power BI, and Copilot studio, our team will be able to accelerate insight delivery to business stakeholders and build agentic workflows faster. It’s a practical path to iterate on new features while keeping governance and security at the forefront.\n> >\n> Mahesh Tyagi, Vice President Finance Engineering, Activision Blizzard\n\n## New Oracle Database@Azure features strengthen its enterprise leadership\n\nEnterprise-grade capabilities are essential for organizations that depend on Oracle databases for mission-critical workloads. That’s why Microsoft continues to advance Oracle Database@Azure, bringing together the scale and resilience of Azure with industry-leading security and AI innovation.\n\nTake a look at our latest announcements. For more details on each of these capabilities, check out our [technical blog](https://aka.ms/AIWTC25).\n\n### Announcing two new capabilities for real-time data integration and replication with Microsoft Fabric for an AI-ready data estate\n\nOracle Database mirroring in [OneLake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview), now in public preview, enables continuous zero-ETL synchronization of Oracle data into OneLake, enabling a unified real-time data estate in Microsoft Fabric. Also available today, native Oracle GoldenGate integration offers managed, high-performance, low-latency replication and can be purchased using [Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/track-consumption-commitment?tabs=portal). Once your Oracle data is connected through Oracle Database@Azure, you can use powerful AI innovation tools like [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio/?msockid=3ab2bb6e96ed69431d7dadea973c68e4), [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs), and [Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/?msockid=0e5b8570c7b2635f2308930dc64362c0).\n\n### Oracle Base Database is generally available\n\nOracle Database@Azure offers customers the flexibility to run any Oracle Database service on Azure. Oracle Database@Azure now supports all popular Oracle database services—Base Database Service, Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure, Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure and Autonomous Database—and also the choice of using either [Oracle Database 19c](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/oracleonazureblog/oracle-databaseazure-now-supports-oracle-database-19c-on-exadata-exascale-and-ne/4458643) or 23ai. This provides customers with a comprehensive set of flexible, simple, and cost-effective migration options when moving their Oracle databases to Azure.\n\nSupport for Oracle workloads goes beyond Oracle Database services. We’re excited to share that Oracle has introduced support policies for running Oracle E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, Enterprise Performance Management, and Oracle Retail Applications in Microsoft Azure using Oracle Database@Azure. This enables businesses to harness the power of Microsoft Azure while leveraging Oracle’s industry-leading database technology to achieve greater scalability, performance, and security. We continue to offer full Oracle Maximum Availability (MAA) support—up to platinum tier—available exclusively on Azure, giving customers the highest levels of availability, disaster recovery, and zero-data-loss protection for mission critical workloads.\n\n### Microsoft Defender now brings industry-leading threat detection and response to Oracle Database@Azure\n\nMicrosoft Defender is a cloud-native security platform that provides unified threat protection, vulnerability management, and automated compliance to safeguard Oracle Database@Azure workloads.
