  "EnhancedContent": "Oracle Database@Azure adds new AI-ready features, expands to 33 regions, and launches new partner and migration programs\n\nTogether, Microsoft and Oracle are delivering the most comprehensive, enterprise‑ready platform for organizations migrating their Oracle solutions to the public cloud—especially those aiming to empower IT professionals and developers to streamline AI adoption and enhance employee productivity.\n\n[Oracle Database@Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/database-overview) was the first offering of its kind in the market and today has the broadest regional availability, new ways to unify your data in [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric), deeper security integrations with [Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender), and can run most Oracle Database services—Base Database Service, Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure, Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure and Autonomous Database as well as [Oracle Database 19c](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/oracleonazureblog/oracle-databaseazure-now-supports-oracle-database-19c-on-exadata-exascale-and-ne/4458643) or 23ai—on Azure.\n\n[Get started with Oracle Database@Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/oracle-database-get-started)\n\nThe result? A truly enterprise‑ready platform that offers more choice, increased control, and expanded opportunity to innovate with confidence–and customers are excited about the impact it’s driving in action.\n\n> >\n> Oracle Database@Azure delivered Exadata-grade performance natively within Azure, enabling us to host our Oracle EBS in the cloud without compromise. We gained native, real-time access to EBS data from Azure and seamless integration with both Oracle and non-Oracle data sources. Paired now with Microsoft Fabric, Power BI, and Copilot studio, our team will be able to accelerate insight delivery to business stakeholders and build agentic workflows faster. It’s a practical path to iterate on new features while keeping governance and security at the forefront.\n> >\n> Mahesh Tyagi, Vice President Finance Engineering, Activision Blizzard\n\n## New Oracle Database@Azure features strengthen its enterprise leadership\n\nEnterprise-grade capabilities are essential for organizations that depend on Oracle databases for mission-critical workloads.
