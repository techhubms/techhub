  "EnhancedContent": "We are excited to announce the general availability of Azure Storage Discovery.\n\nWe are excited to announce the general availability of [Azure Storage Discovery](https://aka.ms/StorageDiscovery), a fully managed service that delivers enterprise-wide visibility into your data estate in [Microsoft Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/?ef_id=_k_003c4a49065118a887ff22a77e78d45b_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM__k_003c4a49065118a887ff22a77e78d45b_k_&amp;msclkid=003c4a49065118a887ff22a77e78d45b) and [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction). Azure Storage Discovery helps you optimize storage costs, comply with security best practices, and drive operational efficiency. With the included [Microsoft Copilot in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/copilot/discover-storage-estate-insights) integration, all decision makers and data users can access and uncover valuable data management insights using simple, everyday language—no specialized programming or query skills required. The intuitive experience provides advanced data visualizations and actional intelligence that are most important to you.\n\n[What is Azure Storage Discovery?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage-discovery/overview)\n\nBusinesses are speeding up digital transformation by storing large amounts of data in Azure Storage for AI, analytics, cloud native apps, HPC, backup, and archive. This data spans multiple subscriptions, regions, and accounts to meet workload needs and compliance rules. The data sprawl makes it challenging to track data growth, spot unexpected data reduction, or optimize costs without clear visibility into data trends and access patterns. Organizations struggle to identify which datasets and business units drive growth and usage the most. Without a global view and streamlined insights across all storage accounts, it’s challenging to ensure data availability, residency, security, and redundancy are consistently aligned with best practices and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nAzure Storage Discovery makes it simple to gain and analyze insights to manage such large data estates.\n\n## Analyze your data estate with Azure Storage Discovery\n\nAzure Storage Discovery lets you easily set up a workspace with storage accounts from any region or subscription you can access. The first insights are available in less than 24 hours, and you can get started by analyzing your data estate.\n\n### Unlock intelligent insights using natural language with Copilot in Azure\n\nUse natural language to ask for the storage insights you need to accomplish your storage management goals. Copilot in Azure expresses them using rich data visualizations, like tables and charts.\n\n### Interactive reports built into the Azure portal\n\nAzure Storage Discovery generates out-of-box dashboards you can access from the Azure portal, with insights that help you visualize and analyze your data estate. The reports include filters for your storage data estate by region, redundancy, and performance, allowing you to quickly drill down and uncover the insights important to you.\n\n### Advanced storage insights\n\nThe reports deliver insights, at a glance, across multiple dimensions, helping you manage your data effectively:\n\n- **Capacity:** Insights about resource, object sizes, and counts aggregated by subscriptions, resource groups, and storage accounts with growth trends.\n- **Activity:** Visualize transactions, ingress, and egress for insights on how your storage is accessed and utilized.\n- **Security:** Highlights critical security configurations of your storage resources with outliers including public network access, shared access key, anonymous access to blobs, and encryption settings.\n- **Configurations:** Surfaces configuration patterns across your storage accounts like redundancy, lifecycle management, inventory, and others.\n- **Errors:** Highlights failed operations and error codes to help identify patterns of issues that might be impacting workloads.\n\n### Kickstart your insights for free, including 15 days of historical data\n\nGetting started is easy with access to 15 days of historical insights within hours of deploying your Azure Storage Discovery workspace. The standard pricing plan offers the most comprehensive set of insights, while the free pricing plan gets you going with the basics.\n\n### Analyze long term trends with 18 months of insights\n\nThe Azure Storage Discovery workspace with the standard pricing plan, will retain insights for up to 18 months so you can analyze long-term trends and any business or season specific workload patterns.\n\nAzure Storage Discovery is available to you today! You can learn more about [Azure Storage Discovery here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage-discovery/overview) and even [get started in the Azure Portal here](https://aka.ms/StorageDiscovery/portal).\n\n## Use Copilot to solve the most important business problems\n\nDuring the design of Azure Storage Discovery, we spoke with many customers across various business-critical roles, such as IT managers, data engineers, and CIOs. We realized AI could simplify onboarding by removing the need for infrastructure deployment or coding knowledge. As a result, we included Copilot in Azure Storage Discovery from the start. It offers insights beyond standard reports and dashboards using natural language queries to deliver actionable information through visualizations like trend charts and tables.\n\nTo get started, simply navigate to your Azure Storage Discovery workspace resource in the Azure portal, and activate Copilot.\n\n![Azure Storage Discovery workspace in the Azure portal, with Copilot panel and data insights charts.&nbsp;](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copilot-start.webp)\n\n### Identify opportunity to optimize costs\n\nUnderstanding storage size trends is crucial for cost optimization, and analyzing these trends by region and performance type can reveal important patterns about how the data is evolving over time. With Azure Storage Discovery’s 18 months of data retention, you can uncover long-term trends and unexpected changes across your data estate, while Copilot quickly visualizes storage size trends broken down by region.\n\n**“How is the storage size trending over the past month by region?”**\n\n![Line graph showing storage size trend over the past months by region.&nbsp;](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copilot-trend-2.webp)\n\nFinding cost-saving opportunities across many storage accounts can be difficult, but Copilot simplifies this by highlighting accounts with the highest savings potential based on capacity and transactions as shown below.\n\n**“Provide a list of storage accounts with default access tier as Hot, that are above 1TiB in size and have the least transactions”**\n\n![A table with a list of storage accounts with more than 1TB of data but least transactions.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copilot-table-1.webp)\n\nBefore taking any action, you can dive even deeper into the insights by evaluating distributions. For example, a distribution of access tiers across blobs.\n\n**“Show me a chart of blob count by blob access tier”**\n\n![Column chart with a distribution of blob count by blob access tier.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copilot-access-tier-capacity-2.webp)\n\nKnowing that the majority of objects are still in the *Hot* tier provides immediate opportunities to reduce costs by enabling [Azure Storage Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage-actions/overview) to tier down or even delete data that is not accessed frequently. Azure Storage Actions is a fully managed, serverless platform that automates data management tasks—like tiering, retention, and metadata updates—across millions of blobs in Azure Blob Storage and Data Lake Storage.\n\n### Assess whether storage configurations align with security best practices\n\nFor better storage security, Microsoft [recommends using Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage) with managed identities instead of Shared Key authentication. Azure Storage Discovery enables you to quickly see that there are still many storage accounts with shared access keys enabled and drill down into a list of Storage accounts that need optimization.\n\n**“Show me a pie chart of my storage accounts with shared access key enabled by region”**\n\n![Pie chart of storage accounts by region with shared access key enabled over past week.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copilot-pie-regions-1.webp)\n\n### Manage your data redundancy requirements\n\nAzure provides several [redundancy options](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy) to meet data availability, disaster recovery, performance, and cost needs. These choices should be regularly reviewed against risks and benefits for an effective storage strategy. Azure Storage Discovery quickly shows the redundancy configuration for all storage accounts and allows you to analyze the most suitable option for each workload and critical business data.\n\n**“Show me a chart of my storage account count by redundancy”**\n\n![Column chart of storage account count by redundancy type.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copilot-count-redundancy.webp)\n\n## Pricing and availability\n\nA single Azure Storage Discovery workspace can analyze the subscriptions and storage accounts from all supported regions.
