We’re committed to helping developers and customers innovate with AI while delivering scalable, cost-efficient operations for organizations of all sizes.\n\n[Read more about Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2LM5HTZJ&amp;ct=250805&amp;st=sb)\n\n## A developer-first experience, built for productivity\n\nWe continue to invest deeply in improving the developer experience across our application platform—offering choice, simplicity, and integration at every layer. Whether customers are building with containers, functions, APIs, or web frameworks, Azure provides a seamless and productive environment to accelerate from idea to impact. Azure offers:\n\n- **Azure App Service**: An enterprise-grade [platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for web apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service) with support for language runtimes across .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Windows, and Linux containers, custom domain management, and deep integration with GitHub and DevOps pipelines.\n\n- **Azure Container Apps**: A [serverless container service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps) ideal for microservices and event-driven workloads, now enhanced with scaling improvements, serverless GPU support, and Azure AI Foundry integration.\n\n- **Azure Functions**: A powerful [serverless compute platform for event-driven](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions) architectures. We recently added enhanced performance with the Flex Consumption plan, .NET 8 remote MCP server support, and improved support for long-running durable workflows.\n\n- **Azure Static Web Apps**: A managed [service for building full stack web applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static) with frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and Blazor with fully managed global distribution of static content.\n\n- **Agentic DevOps:**All of these are services are integrated with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). GitHub Copilot has transformed the way we code, which is why 20 million developers rely on it to build faster. 50 million developers are actively using Visual Studio and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) each month. With Agentic DevOps using GitHub Copilot and [Azure SRE Agent](https://www.azure.com/sreagent), developers can seamlessly go from code to cloud scale faster, accelerating every stage of their application lifecycle.\n\n## Powering the next wave of AI-native apps\n\nAI is fundamentally changing how software is built and experienced. From personalized digital experiences to autonomous agents, applications increasingly rely on embedded intelligence, real-time inference, and orchestration of complex workflows.\n\nMicrosoft is leading the way in AI innovation with [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry)—unifying agents, models, and tools with built-in enterprise-readiness capabilities such as tracing, monitoring, and evaluations. Azure AI Foundry offers a rich catalog of AI models such as OpenAI’s GPT-5, GPT-4o, Meta’s Llama, Microsoft’s Phi-4, and more. AI Foundry integrates with our application platform services like Azure Container Apps and Azure Functions to enable developers to build agentic applications using composable, event-driven, and containerized building blocks.\n\nIn the past year, we introduced key innovations across our application platform to make Azure the home for AI-native applications:\n\n- **Azure Container Apps Serverless GPUs** let customers run AI model inference on demand without managing infrastructure. Serverless GPUs help teams scale generative AI and workloads with ease and cost efficiency.\n\n- **Dynamic sessions in Azure Container Apps** offer secure, on-demand, sandboxed compute environments, ideal for large language model (LLM) generated code, AI agents, and ephemeral workloads.\n\n- **Azure Container Apps integration with Azure AI Foundry** lets customers deploy models from the Foundry model catalog directly to Azure Container Apps, simplifying the model deployment experience.\n\n- **Sidecars in Azure App Service** simplify AI-native app deployment by integrating small language model (SLM) model hosting, routing, and scaling in existing web apps.\n\nBy combining apps, data, and AI in a single platform, Azure enables organizations to build and scale the next generation of intelligent, adaptive applications.\n\n## Built to scale securely and cost effectively\n\nApplications need to do more than run, they must scale, perform reliably, and remain cost-effective. Azure is designed to meet the demands of enterprises and startups alike with built-in capabilities that reduce operational overhead and improve efficiency. Recent enhancements include:\n\n- **Azure App Service Premium v4 plan** **(public preview)** brings a next-generation, fully managed PaaS experience on both Windows and Linux with superior performance, scalability, and cost efficiency powered by modern Azure hardware. It’s built to reduce total cost of ownership, with early testing showing up to 24% savings for Windows web apps compared to the previous Premium v3 tier.\n\n- **Azure Functions Flex Consumption** offers concurrency‑based scaling, instantaneous scale‑from‑zero up to 1,000 instances with no cold starts via the “Always Ready” feature, and seamless virtual network integration.\n\n- **App Service plans with 2+ instances automatically support Availability Zones** without extra set up, while still maintaining a 99.99% SLA. Support for regions with two zones, enhanced zone visibility, and mutable zone redundancy settings further simplify deployment and reduce costs.\n\n## Customers are innovating with Azure’s application platform\n\nWe’re honored by this recognition and thankful for the trust our customers and partners place in us. Their innovation and feedback continue to drive our roadmap and our mission. Here are just a few examples of that innovation in practice.\n\n- [Coca‑Cola](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/22668-coca-cola-company-azure-ai-and-machine-learning) leveraged Azure AI Foundry and Azure application services to build a custom, real‑time conversational “Santa” AI model that interacted with over one million people across 43 markets in 26 languages—launching the immersive “Create Real Magic” holiday campaign in just 60 days. The initiative showcased how the company’s multi‑phase migration to an AI‑ready Azure platform enabled rapid innovation through scalable services like Azure AI Speech, Functions, and Container Apps.\n\n- [Medigold Health](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/19709-medigold-health-consultancy-azure) migrated its applications to Azure App Service and adopted Azure OpenAI Service, along with Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL Database, to automate clinicians’ report generation and significantly cut down administrative effort.
