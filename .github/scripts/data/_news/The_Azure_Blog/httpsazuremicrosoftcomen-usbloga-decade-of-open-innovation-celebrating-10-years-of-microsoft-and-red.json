This year, we celebrate a decade of collaboration. Our journey together has helped customers accelerate hybrid cloud transformation, empower developers to innovate, and strengthen the open source community to drive modern application innovation​.\n\n[Accelerate modernization with Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/openshift)\n\n## The partnership that redefined enterprise cloud\n\nIn 2015, running mission-critical Linux workloads on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) was considered bold and visionary. Ten years later, our partnership with Red Hat has helped thousands of organizations worldwide accelerate digital transformation, set new benchmarks in open innovation, and advance the cloud-native movement for enterprises everywhere.\n\nTogether, we introduced Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) on Azure, setting a new precedent for innovation in the cloud. This collaboration deepened with the addition of Red Hat offerings, including Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)—a fully managed, jointly engineered, and supported application platform that combines cloud scale with open source flexibility.\n\nRed Hat and Microsoft’s global footprint and expanding customer base underline how an open approach and commitment to solving customer challenges drives adoption and innovation at scale.\n\n## Accomplishments and impact​\n\nAzure Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat’s automation platforms are powering digital transformation for global leaders across industries:\n\n- Leaders like [Teranet](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/22690-teranet-inc-azure-red-hat-openshift) have **saved CA$5.6 million in capital expenditures and increased customer confidence** by migrating mission-critical systems and OpenShift containers to Azure, unlocking unmatched scalability and automation.\n- For [Bradesco, Azure Red Hat OpenShift is the secure, scalable backbone of its future-ready AI platform](https://aka.ms/BradescoCustomerStory)—**unifying governance, powering more than 200 enterprise AI initiatives, and accelerating transformation** across every business unit. By integrating Azure OpenAI and Power Platform, Bradesco delivers scalable, compliant innovation in banking services.\n- [**Western Sydney University**](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/20868-western-sydney-university-azure) **improved reliability and accelerated digital research** for thousands of students and faculty with the security and flexibility of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Azure.\n- [**Symend**](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1772332670120262733-symend-azure-machine-learning-professional-services-en-canada) **launched new regions in weeks and powered personalized customer engagement** by adopting Azure Red Hat OpenShift and [Microsoft Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ai/), driving agility at enterprise scale. Microsoft itself leverages [Red Hat’s Ansible Automation Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/helping-microsoft-it-automation) to streamline thousands of endpoints and modernize global network operations for business-critical infrastructure.\n\nTogether, Microsoft and Red Hat have advanced the industry with major accomplishments:\n\n- **Deep integration for real-world flexibility**: Red Hat solutions—like Azure Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform—are available across Azure, including in the [Azure Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us), Azure Government, and expanding regions. Customers benefit from streamlined migrations, enhanced security features, and integrated support that simplifies modernization.​\n- **Modernization and operational agility**: OpenShift Virtualization and Confidential Containers on Azure Red Hat OpenShift enable customers to migrate and modernize legacy applications, run confidential workloads, and automate operations. These capabilities deliver scalability and secure management across hybrid environments.\n- **Accelerating open source innovation**: Together, the companies have made contributions to Kubernetes, containers, cloud monitoring, secure computing standards, and advancing open hybrid architectures for everyone.\n- **Expanding developer and IT choice**: By making [RHEL available for Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/linux-on-azure/red-hat) and supporting hybrid container and virtual machine (VM) environments, Microsoft and Red Hat have given developers flexible, secure, and consistent tools for building anywhere.​\n- **Enabling transformative AI adoption at scale**: By leveraging [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/openshift) as a secure, governable foundation for managing multicloud OpenShift clusters, Bradesco streamlined operations across on-premises and cloud environments. This foundation, combined with [Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/) and Azure OpenAI Service, empowers Bradesco to deliver AI-powered banking solutions that scale securely and responsibly across millions of customers and business units. [Symend](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1772332670120262733-symend-azure-machine-learning-professional-services-en-canada) also adopts Azure Red Hat OpenShift and Azure AI to power personalized customer engagement.\n- **Flexible pricing**: [Azure Hybrid Benefit for RHEL is a key cost optimization](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/red-hat/) feature that allows organizations to maximize existing Red Hat subscriptions when running workloads on Azure. By leveraging this benefit, customers can reduce licensing costs and improve ROI while maintaining enterprise-grade support and security. Including this in the conversation highlights how Azure delivers both technical flexibility and financial efficiency for hybrid environments.\n- Additionally, customers can optimize costs with pay-as-you-go pricing, draw down [Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/track-consumption-commitment?tabs=portal), and receive a single bill for both OpenShift and Azure consumption with Azure Red Hat OpenShift.\n\n[Discover what these solutions can offer your business](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/linux-on-azure/red-hat/?ef_id=_k_Cj0KCQiAxJXJBhD_ARIsAH_JGjixLkmjUDyP75ti3iLDnDpMB8fgJ5jKtpX2cVppWQQu8TTTuKimKHYaArA9EALw_wcB_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM__k_Cj0KCQiAxJXJBhD_ARIsAH_JGjixLkmjUDyP75ti3iLDnDpMB8fgJ5jKtpX2cVppWQQu8TTTuKimKHYaArA9EALw_wcB_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21496728177&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_vgk47uJgXyM7kcaUCm_3oSp&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAxJXJBhD_ARIsAH_JGjixLkmjUDyP75ti3iLDnDpMB8fgJ5jKtpX2cVppWQQu8TTTuKimKHYaArA9EALw_wcB)\n\n## Ten years of innovation: Microsoft and Red Hat partnership highlights\n\nThe partnership’s journey is marked by major shared milestones, summarized in the timeline graphic below:\n\n- November 2015: [Partnership announcement launched a decade of innovation](https://news.microsoft.com/source/2015/11/04/microsoft-and-red-hat-to-deliver-new-standard-for-enterprise-cloud-experiences/).\n- February 2016: Red Hat Enterprise Linux available in the Azure Marketplace with integrated support.\n- May 2019: [Azure Red Hat OpenShift reached general availability (GA)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/premier-developer/announcing-red-hat-on-microsoft-azure/).\n- January 2020: Red Hat Enterprise Linux BYOS Gold images available in Azure.\n- May 2021: JBoss EAP offered as an [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service).\n- January 2022: Ansible released as a managed app for automation.\n- February 2023: [Azure Red Hat OpenShift for Azure Government reached GA](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/best-both-worlds-how-microsoft-and-red-hat-are-revolutionizing-enterprise-it).\n- May 2025: https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-powers-modern-virtualization-microsoft-azure[OpenShift Virtualization on Azure Red Hat OpenShift entered public preview, culminating at Ignite 2025 with GA](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-powers-modern-virtualization-microsoft-azure).\n\n![A timeline of the Microsoft and Red Hat partnership.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-11-21-135733-scaled.webp)*See the attached timeline for more details about key moments and innovations.*​\n\n## Ignite 2025: GA of OpenShift Virtualization and more on Azure Red Hat OpenShift\n\nA defining moment of our tenth anniversary was the [GA of OpenShift Virtualization on Azure Red Hat OpenShift, announced at Microsoft Ignite 2025](https://aka.ms/ARO/Virt).
