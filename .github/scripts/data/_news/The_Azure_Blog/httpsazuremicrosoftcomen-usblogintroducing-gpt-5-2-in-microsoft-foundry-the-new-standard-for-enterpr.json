Learn how advanced reasoning, agentic execution, and compliance-ready features empower developers and technical leaders.\n\nThe age of AI small talk is over. Enterprise applications demand more than clever chat. They require a reliable, reasoning partner capable of solving the most ambiguous, high-stakes problems, including planning multi-agent workflows and delivering auditable code.\n\nAzure is the foundation for solving these challenges. Today, OpenAI’s GPT-5.2 is announced as generally available in [Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/), introducing a new frontier model series purposefully built to meet the needs of enterprise developers and technical leaders—setting a new standard for a new era.\n\n[Explore GPT-5.2 in Foundry today](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/)\n\n## GPT-5.1 vs. GPT-5.2: Key upgrades for developers to know\n\nGPT-5.2 series introduces deeper logical chains, richer context handling, and agentic execution that prompts shippable artifacts. For example, design docs, runnable code, unit tests, and deployment scripts can be generated with fewer iterations. The GPT-5.2 series is built on new architecture, delivering superior performance, efficiency, and reasoning depth compared to prior generations. It’s also trained on the proven GPT-5.1 dataset and further enhanced with improved safety and integrations. GPT-5.2 leaps beyond previous models with substantial performance improvements across core metrics.\n\nToday, we’re shipping **GPT-5.2** and **GPT-5.2-Chat**. Each is greatly improved from its predecessor, and together they excel in everyday professional excellence.\n\n**GPT-5.2:** The most advanced reasoning model that solves harder problems more effectively and with more polish. An example of this is information work, where great thinking is now complemented with better communication skills and improved formatting in spreadsheets and slideshow creation.\n\n**GPT-5.2-Chat:** A powerful yet efficient workhorse for everyday work and learning, with clear improvements in info-seeking questions, how-to’s and walk-throughs, technical writing, and translation. It’s also more effective at supporting studying and skill-building, as well as offering clearer job and career guidance.\n\n## Why GPT-5.2 sets a new standard for enterprise AI\n\nFor long term success in complex professional tasks, teams need structured outputs, reliable tool use, and enterprise guardrails. GPT‑5.2 is optimized for these agent scenarios within [Foundry’s enterprise-grade platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-foundry-scale-innovation-on-a-modular-interoperable-and-secure-agent-stack/), offering consistent developer experience across reasoning, chat, and coding.\n\n- **Multi-Step Logical Chains:** Decomposes complex tasks, justifies decisions, and produces explainable plans.\n- **Context-Aware Planning:** Ingests large inputs (project briefs, codebases, meeting notes) for holistic, actionable output.\n- **Agentic Execution:** Coordinates tasks end-to-end, across design, implementation, testing, and deployment, reducing iteration cycles and manual oversight.\n- **Safety and Governance:** Enterprise-grade controls, managed identities, and policy enforcement for [secure, compliant AI adoption](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/agent-factory-creating-a-blueprint-for-safe-and-secure-ai-agents/).\n\nGPT-5.2’s deep reasoning capabilities, expanded context handling, and agentic patterns make it the smart choice for [building AI agents](https://ai.azure.com/) that can tackle long-running, complex tasks across industries, including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and customer support.\n\n- **Analytics and Decision Support:** Useful for wind tunneling scenarios, explaining trade-offs, and producing defensible plans for stakeholders.\n- **Application Modernization:** Make rapid progress in refactoring services, generating tests, and producing migration plans with risk and rollback criteria.\n- **Data and Pipelines:** Audit ETL, recommend monitors/SLAs, and generate validation SQL for data integrity.\n- **Customer Experiences:** Build context-aware assistants and agentic workflows that integrate into existing apps.\n\nThe results? Agents that maintain reliability through complex workflows and agent service, while producing structured, auditable outputs that scale confidently in Microsoft Foundry.\n\n## GPT-5.2 deployment and pricing\n\n| **Model** | **Deployment** | **Pricing (USD $/million tokens)** | | --- | --- | --- | | | | Input | Cached Input | Output | | **GPT-5.2** | Standard Global | $1.75 | $0.175 | $14.00 | | | Standard Data Zones (US) | $1.925 | $0.193 | $15.40 | | **GPT-5.2-Chat** | Standard Global | $1.75 | $0.175 | $14.00 |\n\n##",
