To date, more than 26,000 customer projects have leveraged our offerings—Azure Migrate and Modernize and Azure Innovate—to drive faster time to value.\n\n## Introducing Azure Accelerate\n\nAs customer cloud and AI adoption needs change, we’re evolving our offerings to match your business priorities. Today, we’re excited to introduce **[Azure Accelerate](https://aka.ms/AzureAccelerate)**, a new simplified offering designed to fuel transformation with experts and investments across the cloud and AI journey. Azure Accelerate brings together the full capabilities of Azure Migrate and Modernize, Azure Innovate, and Cloud Accelerate Factory in one place to assist customers from initial planning to full implementation. With Azure Accelerate, customers can:\n\n- **Access trusted experts:** The deep expertise of [Azure’s specialized partner ecosystem](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/partners/) ensures your projects launch smoothly and scale efficiently. You can also choose to augment your project by taking advantage of a new benefit within Azure Accelerate—our [Cloud Accelerate Factory](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azuremigrationblog/introducing-cloud-accelerate-factory-unlock-zero-cost-deployment-assistance-for-/4409779).

Design and validate new ideas in sandbox environments and then test solutions through funded pilots or proof-of-value projects before scaling. When you’re ready, start your Azure implementation by having experts build an Azure [landing zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/). Then, move workloads into Azure at scale following best practices for migrating or building new solutions.\n\nThe **Cloud Accelerate Factory** is a new benefit within Azure Accelerate and is designed to help you jumpstart your Azure projects with zero-cost deployment assistance from Microsoft experts.
