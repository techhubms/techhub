Having Claude’s advanced reasoning alongside GPT models in one platform gives us flexibility to build scalable, enterprise-grade workflows that move far beyond prototypes.*\n> >\n> *—Michele Catasta, President, Replit*\n\n## Opus 4.5 for real work\n\n**Opus 4.5** **sets a new bar for coding**, agentic workflows, and enterprise productivity: outperforming Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1, at a more accessible price point. Its versatility across software engineering, complex reasoning, tool use, and vision unlocks new opportunities for organizations to modernize systems, automate critical workstreams, and deliver ROI faster.\n\nBy prioritizing rapid integration of the latest models, Foundry allows Azure customers to stay ahead of the curve and maximize the impact of their agentic AI systems; all while maintaining centralized governance, security, and observability at scale.\n\n### 1. Built for production engineering and agentic capabilities\n\nAccording to Anthropic, Opus 4.5 delivers state-of-the-art performance on industry standard software engineering benchmarks, including new highs on SWE-bench **** (80.9%). Early testers consistently describe the model as being able to interpret ambiguous requirements, reason over architectural tradeoffs, and identify fixes for issues that span multiple systems.\n\nOpus 4.5 accelerates engineering velocity by completing multi-day development work in hours with:\n\n- Improved multilingual coding performance\n- More efficient code generation\n- Stronger test coverage\n- Cleaner architectural and refactoring choices\n\n| **Capability / Benchmark** | **Claude Opus 4.5** | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | **Claude Opus 4.1** | **Gemini 3 Pro** | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Agentic coding (SWE-bench Verified) | **80.90%** | 77.20% | 74.50% | 76.20% | | Agentic terminal coding (Terminal-bench 2.0) | **59.30%** | 50.00% | 46.50% | 54.20% | | Agentic tool use — Retail (t2-bench) | **88.90%** | 86.20% | 86.80% | 85.30% | | Agentic tool use — Telecom (t2-bench) | **98.20%** | 98.00% | 71.50% | 98.00% | | Scaled tool use (MCP Atlas) | **62.30%** | 43.80% | 40.90% | \\_ | | Computer use (OSWorld) | **66.30%** | 61.40% | 44.40% | \\_ | | Novel problem solving (ARC-AGI-2 Verified) | **37.60%** | 13.60% | \\_ | 31.10% | | Graduate-level reasoning (GPQA Diamond) | **87.00%** | 83.40% | 81.00% | 91.90% | | Visual reasoning (MMMU validation) | **80.70%** | 77.80% | 77.10% | \\_ | | Multilingual Q&A (MMLU) | **90.80%** | 89.10% | 89.50% | 91.80% |\n\n[*Claude Opus 4.5 benchmark results from Anthropic*](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5)\n\nOpus 4.5 is also one of the **strongest tool-using models available today**, capable of powering agents that work seamlessly across hundreds of tools. Developers gain access to several important upgrades:\n\n- **Programmatic Tool Calling**: Execute tools directly in Python for more efficient, deterministic workflows.\n- **Tool Search**: Dynamically discover tools from large libraries without using up space in the context window.\n- **Tool Use Examples**: More accurate tool calling for complex tool schemas.\n\nTogether, these capabilities enable sophisticated agents across cybersecurity, full-stack software engineering, financial modeling, and other workflows requiring multiple tool interactions. Opus 4.5 shows strong, real-world intelligence applying these tools creatively within constraints. In testing, the model successfully navigated complex policy environments, such as airline change rules, chaining upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and rebookings to optimize outcomes. This kind of adaptive, constraint-aware problem-solving reflects a meaningful step forward in what agentic AI systems can accomplish.\n\n> >\n> *Manus deeply utilizes Anthropic’s Claude models because of their strong capabilities in coding and long-horizon task planning, together with their prowess to handle agentic tasks.
