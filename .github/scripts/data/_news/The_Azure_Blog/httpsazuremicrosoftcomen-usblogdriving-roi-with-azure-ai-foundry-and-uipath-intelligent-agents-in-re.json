At Microsoft, we are partnering with UiPath—a preferred enterprise agentic automation platform on Azure—to empower customers with integrated solutions that combine automation and AI at scale.\n\nOne example is Azure AI Foundry agents and UiPath agents (built on [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry)) orchestrated by UiPath Maestro™ in business processes, ensuring AI insights seamlessly flow into automated business processes that deliver measurable value.\n\n[Get started with agents built on Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry)\n\n## From insight to action: Managing incidental findings in healthcare\n\nIn healthcare, where every insight can influence a life, the ability of AI to connect information and trigger timely action is especially transformative. **Incidental findings in radiology reports**—unexpected abnormalities uncovered during imaging studies like CT or MRI scans—represent one of the most challenging and overlooked gaps in patient care\n\nAs the volume of patient data grows, overlooked incidental findings outside the original imaging scope can delay care, raise costs, and increase liability risks.\n\n![Incidental Findings Analysis steps: imaging results, identify findings, review, and follow-up.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Incidental_Process_Screenshot-1.webp)\n\nThis is where AI steps in. In this workflow, [**Azure AI Foundry agents**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/agents/agent-types/azure-ai-foundry-agent?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and **UiPath agents**—orchestrated by **UiPath Maestro™**—work together to operationalize this process in healthcare:\n\n1. **Radiology reports** are generated and finalized in existing systems.\n2. **UiPath medical record summarization (MRS)** agents review reports, flagging incidental findings.\n3. **Azure AI Foundry imaging agents** analyze historical PACS images and radiology data, comparing past results with current findings relevant to the additional findings.\n4. UiPath agents aggregate all results—including pertinent EMR history, prior imaging, and AI-generated imaging insights—into a **comprehensive follow-up report.**\n5. **The aggregated information** is forwarded to the original ordering care provider in addition to the primary radiology report, eliminating the need to manually comb through the chart and prior exams for pertinent information. This creates both a secondary notification of the incidental finding and puts **the summarized, relevant patient information** in the clinicians’ hands, efficiently supporting the provision of safe, timely care.\n6. **UiPath Maestro™** orchestrates the business process, routing the consolidated packet to the ordering physician or specialist for next steps.\n\n![Workflow in UiPath Studio: gather EMR data, extract findings, summarize, analyze images, display output.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MaestroScreenshot-2-scaled.webp)\n\nThe combination of UiPath and Azure AI Foundry agents turns siloed data into precise documentation that can be used to [create actionable care pathways](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/health-data-services)—accelerating clinical decision making, reducing physician workload, and improving patient outcomes.\n\nThis scenario is enabled by:\n\n- **UiPath Maestro**™: Orchestrates complex workflows that span multiple agents, systems, and data sources; and integrates natively with Azure AI Foundry and UiPath Agents, providing tracing capabilities that create business trust in underlying AI agents.\n- **UiPath** **a** **gents**: Extract and summarize structured and unstructured data from EMRs, reports, and historical records.\n- **Azure AI Foundry agents**: Analyze medical images and generate AI-powered diagnostic insights with healthcare-specific models **** on Azure AI Foundry that provide secure data access through DICOMweb APIs and FHIR standards, ensuring compliance and scalability.\n\nTogether, this creates an **[agentic ecosystem on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework/)** where AI insights are not isolated but operationalized directly within end-to-end business processes.\n\n![Azure AI Foundry CxrReportGen model page showing overview, use this model button, and deployment details.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CXR_ReportGen_Screenshot-1.webp)\n\n## Delivering customer value\n\nBy embedding AI into automated workflows, customers see tangible ROI:\n\n- **Improved outcomes**: Faster detection and follow-up on incidental findings.\n- **Efficiency gains**: Automated data collection, summarization, and reporting reduce manual physician workload.\n- **Cost savings**: Early detection helps prevent expensive downstream interventions.\n- **Trust and compliance**: Built on Azure & UiPath’s security, privacy, and healthcare data standards.\n\nThis is the promise of combining **enterprise-grade automation** with **enterprise-ready AI**.\n\n## What customers are saying about AI automation in healthcare\n\n> >\n> AI-powered automation is redefining how healthcare operates. At Mercy, we are beginning to partner with Microsoft and UiPath which will allow us to move beyond data silos and create intelligent workflows that truly serve patients. This is the future of care—where insights instantly translate into action.\n> >\n> **Robin Spraul, Automation Manager-Automation Opt & Process Engineering, Mercy**\n\n## Partnership perspectives\n\n> >\n> With UiPath Maestro and Azure AI Foundry working together, we’re helping enterprises operationalize AI across workflows that matter most. This is how we turn intelligence into impact.\n> >\n> **Asha Sharma, Corporate Vice President, Azure AI Platform**\n\n> >\n> Healthcare is just the beginning. UiPath and Microsoft are empowering organizations everywhere to unlock ROI by bringing automation and AI together in real-world business processes.\n> >\n> **Graham Sheldon, Chief Product Officer, UiPath**\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThis healthcare scenario is one of many where UiPath and [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry) are transforming operations. From finance to supply chain to customer service, organizations can now confidently scale AI-powered automation with UiPath Maestro™ on Azure.\n\nAt Microsoft, we believe AI is only as valuable as the outcomes it delivers. Together with UiPath, we are enabling enterprises to achieve those outcomes today.",
