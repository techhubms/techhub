As we heard from Kyle Daigle, Chief Operating Officer, GitHub, on stage this week, it is “the new era of collaboration.” Agents have become an integral part of software development already, taking on manual, repetitive coding tasks so developers can focus on complex problem-solving and creative, higher impact work. Developers have been at the forefront of AI from the beginning. They are showing us how agents can break down traditional roles, redefine processes, and introduce a scaling effect so we can build AI-powered solutions as quickly as we can dream them up.\n\n![Kyle Daigle, GitHub Chief Operating Officer, at the GitHub Universe 2025 event. ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GitHub_25-327.jpg)\n\nGitHub is supporting every developer, on every language, and running locally or in any cloud, as they set an example for every other business function on the role of AI. This year’s GitHub Universe event was a celebration of code and community, and a showcase of developer tools, developer control, and developer choice. Our friends at GitHub [announced key innovations](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/welcome-home-agents/) to build agentic apps with enterprise-grade security, scalability, and trust. Now with Agent HQ—the open ecosystem that unites every agent on a single platform—there is [one mission control](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-a-mission-control-to-assign-steer-and-track-copilot-coding-agent-tasks/?utm_source=blog-day1-recap-mission-control-cta&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25) to assign, govern, and track multiple agents in one place. Microsoft is helping turn this vision into velocity, delivering the infrastructure and products developers need to build what’s next. The rise of agents is a transformation we [first introduced at Microsoft Build](https://aka.ms/agenticdevops), and it’s accelerating fast. By harnessing the full power of the Azure portfolio, agentic AI becomes more than a productivity boost. It’s a strategic advantage.\n\n## Record-breaking growth and momentum\n\n[GitHub’s Octoverse 2025 report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/), released this week, offers an annual snapshot of global software development trends, highlighted record-breaking growth, and momentum across the developer ecosystem:\n\n[Find the full Octoverse 2025 summary here](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/)\n\n- **180M+ developers** work and build on GitHub.\n- **Nearly 80% of developers new to GitHub** use Copilot in their first week.\n- **630M total projects on GitHub**, +121M in 2025, the biggest year yet.\n- **1.12B contributions** to public and open source repositories, +13% year-over-year.\n- **4.3M+ AI-related repositories**, nearby double since 2023.\n- **TypeScript and Python are the two most used languages in 2025**, signaling a shift driven by AI preferences.\n\n![Nearly 80% of new developers on GitHub use Copilot in their first week text.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/octoverse-2025-80-percent-of-new-devs-use-copilot-in-week-one.jpg)\n\nThese numbers reflect a global movement—developers embracing AI, open source, and cloud-native tools to build faster and smarter. At Microsoft, we *are* customer zero when it comes to leveraging AI every day across various business processes and workflows. Nearly all of Microsoft’s engineers use [GitHub Copilot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/github/Copilot) as part of their development processes. Agents will make us not only more efficient and faster but fundamentally reinvent how we work.\n\nThis transformation isn’t just enterprise-led. As AI and agentic workflows are redefining how software gets built, it was clear while in San Francisco this week, startups are at the forefront.\n\n> >\n> I work with startups all over the world building cutting-edge data and AI solutions, and I see every day how GitHub Copilot makes it possible for startups to run leaner, make the most of their dev resources and ship faster. It makes a huge difference in terms of their quality of output and time to market. GitHub Copilot is now the standard that’s powering the next generation of AI solutions.\n> >\n> Heena Purohit, Global Director, Data and AI, Microsoft for Startups\n\nThis next era is about giving developers even more autonomy, intelligence, and infrastructure to help organizations unlock new value. When developers thrive, the business thrives.\n\n## Empowering every organization with AI tools built for what’s next\n\n[Microsoft Azure offers a full-stack platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) that brings together AI-powered developer tools, agents, and enterprise-grade security from cloud to edge. It’s a human-centered approach to software delivery, designed to help every organization move faster, build smarter, and innovate with confidence. Agents are changing the game by assisting developers (and each other) across the entire lifecycle. Agents can tackle bug fixes, documentation to code reviews, and deploy to Azure, so developers can focus on what they do best: create.\n\n- [You can now build and deploy AI agents end-to-end in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_105#_vs-code-at-github-universe) with help from GitHub Copilot. AI Toolkit for VS Code lets developers explore models and build agents where they code—with evaluation and tracing in one place. Now, with prompt-first agent development powered by GitHub Copilot and [built on the Microsoft Agent Framework](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework/), developers can create, refine, and launch production-ready agents faster and more intuitively than ever—all from within their favorite editor.\n- [Azure MCP Server is now generally available](http://aka.ms/azmcp/announcement/ga), giving your agents the power of cloud and redefining how developers interact with Azure. Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP), it can create a secure, standards-based bridge between Azure services—like AKS, ACA, App Service, Cosmos DB, SQL, AI Foundry, and Fabric—and AI-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot. Imagine managing cloud resources, generating infrastructure-as-code, and troubleshooting deployments—all through natural language, right from your favorite IDE or MCP-compatible client, and all aligned with Azure best practices. Azure MCP Server accelerates innovation, eliminates context switching, and delivers enterprise-grade security and scalability. It’s not just a tool—it’s the future of intelligent cloud development.\n\nModern app development is in a new era—where developers are moving from writing code to orchestrating autonomous systems that understand and act on intent. [On the main stage this week](http://aka.ms/GHU2025Mainstage), Amanda Silver, Corporate Vice President and Head of Product for Apps and Agents at Microsoft, showcased how Microsoft and GitHub Copilot work together to empower spec-driven development, code generation with Azure context, prompt first agent creation, workflow orchestration, and operational excellence. Together, redefining how human creativity becomes production-ready innovation.\n\n## Becoming frontier starts here\n\nAt Microsoft, we’re proud to be part of this journey—providing the infrastructure and integration that make agentic development real for enterprises around the world.\n\nGitHub Universe 2025 wasn’t just a showcase, it was a signal. AI is now the default expectation in software development, and agentic workflows are becoming the new standard. And with GitHub and Azure working together, we uniquely deliver the tools, platforms, and vision to help every developer thrive.\n\nWe’re building that future alongside GitHub, our customers, our startups and partner ecosystem, and the global developer community. Because when the right tools are in the hands of developers, transformation isn’t a question of *if*—it’s a matter of *how fast*. When developers lead, innovation follows.",
