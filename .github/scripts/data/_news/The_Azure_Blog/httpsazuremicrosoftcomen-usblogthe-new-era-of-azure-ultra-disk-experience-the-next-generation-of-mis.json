Ultra Disk was a breakthrough in cloud block storage innovation from the start, introducing independent configuration of capacity, IOPS, and throughput to deliver precise performance at scale. And we’ve continued to push boundaries ever since. Committing to a purposeful evolution, not just enhancing performance and resilience for mission-critical workloads but working to ensure every advancement addresses the real-world needs of our customers.\n\n[How to deploy and use an Ultra Disk?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd?tabs=azure-portal)\n\nThese advancements are not just theoretical; they’re driving real impact for customers operating on a global scale. One example being **BlackRock**, a global asset manager and technology provider, who leverages Azure Ultra Disk in conjunction with M-series Virtual Machines to power their mission-critical investment platform, Aladdin. For **BlackRock,** delivering ultra-low latency and exceptional reliability is paramount to swiftly adapting to dynamic market conditions and managing portfolios with agility and confidence.\n\n> >\n> Now that we’re on Azure, we have a springboard to unlock adoption of cloud-managed services to be able to engineer and operate at greater scale and adopt innovative technologies.\n> >\n> Randall Fradin, Head of Cloud Managed Services and Platform Engineering, BlackRock\n\nRead the full customer story [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/25275-blackrock-financial-management-azure-ultra-disk-storage#customers-share-modal-dialog).\n\nStories like BlackRock’s illustrate the power of Ultra Disk in action and they inspire us to keep evolving. That’s why today, we are excited to unveil a transformative update to Ultra Disk, designed to deliver superior speed, resilience, and cost efficiency for your most sensitive workloads. This major refresh introduces higher performance, greater flexibility to optimize cost, and instant access snapshots to support business continuity. With these advancements, Ultra Disk empowers organizations to accelerate operations, restore data rapidly, and scale with confidence–no matter the level of demand or criticality.\n\n## What’s new with Ultra Disk?\n\n### Ultra Disk delivers reliable performance with improved average, P99.9, and outlier latency\n\nFor mission-critical workloads, even brief disruptions can have significant impacts. That is why we have prioritized reducing tail latency at P99.9 and above. Our platform enhancements have resulted in 80% reduction in both P99.9 and outlier latency, along with a 30% improvement in average latency. These advancements make Ultra Disk the best choice for highly I/O-intensive and latency-sensitive workloads, such as transaction logs for mission-critical applications.\n\nIf you are using local SSD or Write Accelerator to achieve lower latencies, we recommend exploring Ultra Disk as an alternative option for enhanced data persistency and greater flexibility for capacity and performance.\n\n### Optimize application cost without sacrificing performance\n\nOur goal is to support workload in maximizing both efficiency and performance. Ultra Disk’s latest provisioning model now offers greater granular control over capacity and performance, enabling better cost management. Workloads on small disks can save up to 50% while large disks can save up to 25%. These [updated features are now available](https://aka.ms/flexibleprovisioning) for both new and existing Ultra Disks:\n\n| | *Greater control* | *Previous* | | --- | --- | --- | | *GiB capacity billing* | Billed at 1 GiB granularity | Billed at tiers | | *Maximum IOPS per GiB* | 1,000 IOPS per GiB | 300 IOPS per GiB | | *Minimum IOPS per disk* | 100 IOPS | Higher of 100 or 1 IOPS per GiB | | *Minimum MB/s per disk* | 1 MB/s | Higher of 1 MB/s or 4 KB/s per IOPS |\n\nA financial application operates its core database on Ultra Disk to serve market trend insight. This database stores large amount of data but only require moderate IOPS and throughput at low latency when needed (no more than 12,500 GiB, 5000 IOPS and 200 MB/s). With more flexible control over capacity and performance, this deployment now saves 22% from its Ultra Disk spending, illustrated below using East US prices.\n\n| *Cost per month* | *Previous* | *Improved flexibility* | *Savings* | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | *12,500 GiB* | $1,594 for 13,312 GiB (rounded to next tier) | $1,497 for 12,500 GiB | **-6%** | | *5,000 IOPS* | $661 for 13,312 IOPS | $248 for 5,000 IOPS | **-62%** | | *200 MB/s* | $70 for 200 MB/s | No change | No change | | ***Ultra Disk Total*** | $2,324 | $1,815 | **-22%** |\n\n### Unlock high performance workloads on Azure Boost and Ultra Disk\n\nUltra Disk and Azure Boost now enable a new class of high-performance workloads:\n\n- [Memory Optimized Mbv3 VM – Standard_M416bs_v3](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/sapapplications/new-mbv3-size-standard-m416bs-v3-general-availability/4439103) – GA, up to 550,000 IOPS and 10GB/s\n- [Azure Boost Ebdsv5 VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series) – GA up to 400,000 IOPS and 10GB/s\n- Stay tuned for newest Azure Boost VM announcement at 2025 Ignite for unprecedented remote Block Storage performance\n\nThese innovations empower customers to confidently operate high-demand applications such as large-scale SQL databases, electronic health record systems, and mission-critical enterprise platforms. Ultra Disk is equipped to address rigorous performance requirements leveraging the latest advancements in Virtual Machine technology.\n\n### Instant Access Snapshot enables you to restore and run your business application immediately\n\nWe are thrilled to announce an exciting new experience: **Instant Access Snapshot** for Ultra and Premium SSD v2 disks, now available in [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=520805). With Instant Access, you can immediately use snapshots after creation to generate new disks, eliminating the wait time (often spanning numerous hours) traditionally required for background data copy before the snapshot is in a ready and usable state. Disks generated from these Instant Access Snapshots now hydrate up to 10x faster and experience minimal read latency impact during the hydration process. This advanced capability marks a significant leap forward in the public cloud market, enabling rapid recovery and replication scale-out for your organization in real time. No more lengthy restoration processes or costly downtime! Instant Access Snapshot empowers you to get back to business within moments, not hours.\n\n## Building on the foundation of security, flexibility, and efficiency for Ultra Disk\n\nLet’s walk through a few other features recently released that will greatly enhance your high-performance workload experience on Ultra Disk.\n\n- Operate with cost-efficiency by expanding your Ultra Disk capacity live with the support of [live resize](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/expand-disks#expand-with-ultra-disks-and-premium-ssd-v2) and dynamically [adjusting Ultra Disk performance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd?tabs=azure-portal#adjust-the-performance-of-an-ultra-disk) to avoid over provisioning.\n- Run your business application securely with [encryption at host](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption#encryption-at-host---end-to-end-encryption-for-your-vm-data) on Ultra Disk.
