These organizations blend human ambition with AI-powered technology to reshape how innovation is scaled, work is orchestrated and value is created. They’re accelerating AI transformation to enrich employee experiences, reinvent customer engagement, reshape business processes and unlock creativity and innovation.\n\nTo empower customers in becoming Frontier, we’re excited to announce the launch of the reimagined [**Microsoft Marketplace**](https://marketplace.microsoft.com?ocid=cmmlvdg0mq9), your trusted source for cloud solutions, AI apps and agents. This further realizes Marketplace as an extension of the Microsoft Cloud, where we collaborate with our partner ecosystem to bring their innovations to our customers globally. By offering a comprehensive catalog across cloud solutions and industries, Microsoft Marketplace accelerates the path to becoming a Frontier Firm. With today’s announcement, we are excited to share:\n\n- The new Microsoft Marketplace, a single destination to find, try, buy and deploy cloud solutions, AI apps and agents. Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource are now unified to simplify cloud and AI management. Available today in the US and coming soon to customers worldwide.\n- Tens of thousands of cloud and industry solutions in the Marketplace catalog across a breadth of categories ranging from data and analytics to productivity and collaboration, in addition to industry-specific offerings.\n- Over 3,000 AI apps and agents are newly available directly on Marketplace and in Microsoft products — from Azure AI Foundry to Microsoft 365 Copilot — with rapid provisioning within your Microsoft environment through industry standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n- Marketplace integrations with Microsoft’s channel ecosystem, empowering you to buy where and how you want — whether from your cloud service provider (CSP) or relying on a trusted partner to procure cloud and AI solutions on your behalf.\n\nYouTube Video\n\n### **AI apps and agents for every use case**\n\nMicrosoft Marketplace gives you access to thousands of AI apps and agents from our rich partner ecosystem designed to automate tasks, accelerate decision-making and unlock value across your business. With a new AI Apps and Agents category, you can easily and confidently find AI solutions that integrate with your organization’s existing Microsoft products.\n\n>\n> *“With Microsoft Marketplace, we reduced configuration time of AI apps from nearly 20 minutes to just 1 minute per instance. That efficiency boost has translated into increased productivity and lower operating costs. Marketplace is a strategic channel for Siemens, where we’ve seen an 8X increase in customer adoption. It’s a powerful platform for scaling both sides of our business.”*\n> > >\n> ***—** Jeff Zobrist, VP Global Partner Ecosystem and Go To Market |*\n>\n> *Siemens Digital Industries Software*\n>\n\nSpecial thanks to these partners who are launching new AI offerings in Microsoft Marketplace today:[![A sampling of AI apps and agents available in Microsoft Marketplace.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OMB-Market-Image-1-9_26_25.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OMB-Market-Image-1-9_26_25.png)\n\n### **Comprehensive catalog across cloud solutions and industries**\n\nMicrosoft Marketplace offers solutions across dozens of categories ranging from data and analytics to productivity and collaboration, in addition to industry-specific offerings. Microsoft Marketplace is a seamless extension of the Microsoft Cloud, uniting solutions integrated with Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, Microsoft Security and more.\n\n>\n> *“The Microsoft Marketplace, in particular, helps us balance innovation with confidence by giving us access to trusted solutions that integrate seamlessly with our Azure environment — ultimately enabling us to move faster while staying true to our Five Principles.”*\n> > >\n> ***—** Matthew Hillegass, Commercial Director – Infrastructure & Information Security |Mars Inc.*\n>\n\nFor organizations with a Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment, 100% of your purchase for any of the thousands of *Azure benefit eligible* solutions available on Marketplace continue to count toward your commitment. This helps you spend smarter to maximize your cloud and AI investments.\n\n### **Integrated experience from discovery to deployment**\n\nContextually relevant cloud solutions, AI apps and agents built by our partners are also available directly within Microsoft products — providing users, developers and IT practitioners with approved solutions in the flow of work. For example, [Agent Store](https://aka.ms/copilotblog_agentstore_and_marketplace) includes Copilot agents within the Microsoft 365 Copilot experience. The same applies for apps in Microsoft Teams, models and tools in Azure AI Foundry and future experiences including MCP servers.\n\nBy integrating offerings from Marketplace directly into the Microsoft Cloud, IT is equipped with management and control tools that enable both innovation and governance. When you acquire a Copilot agent or an app running on Azure from Microsoft Marketplace, it’s provisioned and distributed to team members aligned to your security and governance standards.\n\nYouTube Video\n\n### **Powering partner growth**\n\nFor our partners, Microsoft Marketplace sits at the center of how we work together. We’re continuously expanding its capabilities to help our partners drive growth — whether that means scaling through digital sales, deepening channel partnerships or landing transformative deals.\n\nWe’ve invested in multiparty private offers, CSP integration and CSP private offers to connect software development companies and channel partners on Marketplace, creating more complete solutions to address customers’ needs. Today, we’re excited to share that valued partners including Arrow, Crayon, Ingram Micro, Pax8 and TD SYNNEX are integrating Microsoft Marketplace into their marketplaces, further extending customer reach.\n\nAdditionally, a new Marketplace capability called *resale enabled offers* is now in private preview. This empowers software companies to authorize their channel partners to sell on their behalf through private offers — unlocking new routes to market.\n\n>\n> *“We’re incredibly excited about the path forward with Microsoft. This integration with the Marketplace catalog is just the beginning — we see endless potential to co-innovate and help customers navigate their AI-first transformation with confidence.”*\n> > >\n> ***—** Melissa Mulholland, Co-CEO* | *SoftwareOne and Crayon*\n>\n\nNicole Dezen, Chief Partner Officer and Corporate Vice President, Global Channel Partner Sales at Microsoft, shares more details about the partner opportunity with Microsoft Marketplace [in her blog](https://aka.ms/SepMarketplacePartnerBlog).\n\n### **Becoming Frontier with Microsoft Marketplace**\n\nWhether you’re seeking to accelerate innovation, empower your teams with AI or unlock new value through trusted partners, Microsoft Marketplace brings together the solutions, expertise and ecosystem to meet your business needs.
