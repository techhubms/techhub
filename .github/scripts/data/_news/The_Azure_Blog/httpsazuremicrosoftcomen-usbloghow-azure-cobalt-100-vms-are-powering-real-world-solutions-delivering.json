By adopting Azure Cobalt 100 VMs, we’ve achieved up to a* [*20% performance boost*](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.siemens.com%2Fen-us%2Fsiemens-questa-one%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjasminechang%40microsoft.com%7C711b454821f64cc103d308ddf783b1ef%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638938867528975146%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=5%2BYiWazpxrjEdU5XF%2FqribXkOn54aLL9gf8882dkCSU%3D&amp;reserved=0)*in our Questa One DFT simulations – accelerating fault and formal verification cycles across analog, memory, and digital workloads. This leap in efficiency empowers our teams to deliver faster, more reliable results for one of the most complex designs in the industry.”*\n> >\n> *– Abhi Kolpekwar, VP & GM, Siemens EDA, Siemens Digital Industries Software*\n\n> >\n> *“We conducted extensive benchmarking of the new Cobalt 100 VMs for containerized application workloads running on AKS and observed measurable price-performance gains compared to Azure’s previous-generation Arm-based VM series, with improvements evident across both throughput and cost-efficiency metrics. Following these results, we have migrated 70% of our AKS workloads to Cobalt 100 VMs and are in the process of migrating the remaining 30%.”*\n> >\n> *— Gopala Krishna Padidadakala, Sr Director of Cloud Engineering, Sprinklr*\n\n> >\n>  *“Temenos is proud to set a new industry benchmark for scalable, AI-powered banking on Microsoft Azure, leveraging the breakthrough performance of Cobalt 100 VMs. The combination of Temenos’ cloud-native platform and Azure’s Arm-based Cobalt 100 VMs allowed us to achieve*[*over 40% efficiency improvement*](https://www.temenos.com/press_release/temenos-sets-new-benchmark-for-scalability-of-ai-powered-banking-with-microsoft/)*compared to the 2024 benchmark exercise, enabling banks to run demanding workloads with greater efficiency and sustainability. This collaboration empowers financial institutions to innovate faster and scale securely, transforming the future of digital banking.”*\n> >\n> *— Eugene Khmelevsky, Head of Architecture and Data, Temenos*\n\nMicrosoft’s own services are also benefiting from the adoption of Cobalt 100 VMs. The deployment of Cobalt 100 VMs for Microsoft’s services demonstrates its ability to support large-scale, mission-critical applications.\n\n**Microsoft Teams** has achieved up to [**45% better performance**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cobalt-100-based-virtual-machines-are-now-generally-available/?msockid=03d4cce39aaa635b002dd9b19b6d62ef) using these VMs than previously possible. Teams is a latency-sensitive application that serves millions of users worldwide, and the ability to process requests more efficiently has a direct impact on user experience. The media processor capability in Teams—supporting audio/video streaming—runs on Cobalt 100 VMs with lower compute footprint. That translates to resource reduction of **up to 35% fewer compute cores** needed for the workload. Cobalt 100 VMs unlock exceptional efficiency, empowering teams to achieve more, faster, with fewer resources.\n\n**Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** is a cloud-native security service with hundreds of microservices that perform threat detection, data analysis, and protection at massive scale. We have seen **40% better performance in MDE’s cyber data curator**, running on Cobalt 100 VMs. Curator groups high-volume data into partitions in real time for fast, scalable processing. Faster processing and higher throughput translate to better user experiences, including faster threat response in MDE.\n\nThese results underscore the value of Microsoft’s approach to architect and develop customized infrastructure; Cobalt 100 is not just a new type of general compute VM, but one of the most optimized compute products in Azure. Whether it’s accelerating product development, scaling analytics platforms, or improving user experiences, customers are finding that the combination of performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness makes Cobalt 100 VMs a compelling choice for modern cloud workloads.\n\nCobalt 100 demonstrates Microsoft’s end-to-end systems strategy in practice. By designing the CPU in-house and optimizing it for Azure’s infrastructure, Microsoft has created a tightly integrated infrastructure that delivers consistent performance across a variety of cloud scenarios. This approach allows for better control over power consumption, thermal management, and workload distribution, resulting in a powerful and efficient cloud environment.\n\n![Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 in hand.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-17.webp)\n\nAs more organizations look to modernize their infrastructure and adopt cloud-native technologies, the demand for highly performant and energy-efficient compute resources will continue to grow.
