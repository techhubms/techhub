  "EnhancedContent": "**July 23, 2025 update** – Expanded analysis and threat intelligence from our continued monitoring of exploitation activity by Storm-2603 leading to the deployment of Warlock ransomware. Based on new information, we have updated the Attribution, Indicators of compromise, extended and clarified Mitigation and protection guidance (including raising *Step 6: Restart IIS* for emphasis), Detections, and Hunting sections.\n\nOn July 19, 2025, Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) [published a blog](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/) addressing active attacks against on-premises SharePoint servers that exploit CVE-2025-49706, a spoofing vulnerability, and CVE-2025-49704, a remote code execution vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect on-premises SharePoint servers only and do not affect SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365. Microsoft has released new comprehensive security updates for all supported versions of SharePoint Server (Subscription Edition, 2019, and 2016) that protect customers against these new vulnerabilities. Customers should apply these updates immediately to ensure they are protected.\n\nThese comprehensive security updates address newly disclosed security vulnerabilities in [CVE-2025-53770](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770) that are related to the previously disclosed vulnerability CVE-2025-49704. The updates also address the security bypass vulnerability [CVE-2025-53771](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53771) for the previously disclosed CVE-2025-49706.\n\nAs of this writing, Microsoft has observed two named Chinese nation-state actors, Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon exploiting these vulnerabilities targeting internet-facing SharePoint servers. In addition, we have observed another China-based threat actor, tracked as Storm-2603, exploiting these vulnerabilities to deploy ransomware. Investigations into other actors also using these exploits are still ongoing. With the rapid adoption of these exploits, Microsoft assesses with high confidence that threat actors will continue to integrate them into their attacks against unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems. This blog shares details of observed exploitation of CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704 and the follow-on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by threat actors. We will update this blog with more information as our investigation continues.\n\nMicrosoft recommends customers to use supported versions of on-premises SharePoint servers with the latest security updates. To stop unauthenticated attacks from exploiting this vulnerability, customers should also integrate and enable Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) and Microsoft Defender Antivirus (or equivalent solutions) for all on-premises SharePoint deployments and configure AMSI to enable Full Mode as detailed in Mitigations section below. Customers should also rotate SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys, restart Internet Information Services (IIS), and deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint or equivalent solutions.\n\n| **Product** | **Security update link** | | --- | --- | | Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition | [Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Server Subscription Edition (KB5002768)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108285) | | Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 *(both updates should be installed)* | [Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint 2019 (KB5002754)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108286) <br><br>[Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2019 Language Pack (KB5002753)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108287) | | Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016 *(both updates should be installed)* | [Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 (KB5002760)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108288) <br><br>[Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016 Language Pack (KB5002759)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=108289) |\n\n## Observed tactics and techniques\n\nMicrosoft observed multiple threat actors conducting reconnaissance and attempting exploitation of on-premises SharePoint servers through a POST request to the ToolPane endpoint.\n\n![A screenshot of a computer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Fig1-Post-request-1024x171.webp)Figure 1. POST request to ToolPane endpoint\n\n### Post-exploitation activities\n\nThreat actors who successfully executed the authentication bypass and remote code execution exploits against vulnerable on-premises SharePoint servers have been observed using a web shell in their post-exploitation payload.\n\n### Web shell deployment\n\nIn observed attacks, threat actors send a crafted POST request to the SharePoint server, uploading a malicious script named *spinstall0.aspx.* Actors have also modified the file name in a variety of ways, such as *spinstall.aspx*, *spinstall1.aspx*, *spinstall2.aspx,* etc. The *spinstall0.aspx* script contains commands to retrieve MachineKey data and return the results to the user through a GET request, enabling the theft of the key material by threat actors.\n\n### Related IOCs and hunting queries\n\nMicrosoft provides indicators of compromise (IOCs) to identify and hunt for this web shell in the Indicators of compromise section of this blog. Microsoft provides related hunting queries to find this dropped file in the Hunting queriessection of this blog.\n\n## Attribution\n\nAs early as July 7, 2025, Microsoft analysis suggests threat actors were attempting to exploit CVE-2025-49706 and CVE-2025-49704 to gain initial access to target organizations. These actors include Chinese state actors Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon and another China-based actor Storm-2603.  The TTPs employed in these exploit attacks align with previously observed activities of these threat actors.\n\n### Linen Typhoon\n\nSince 2012, Linen Typhoon has focused on stealing intellectual property, primarily targeting organizations related to government, defense, strategic planning, and human rights. This threat actor is known for using drive-by compromises and historically has relied on existing exploits to compromise organizations.\n\n### Violet Typhoon\n\nSince 2015, the Violet Typhoon activity group has been dedicated to espionage, primarily targeting former government and military personnel, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks, higher education, digital and print media, financial and health related sectors in the United States, Europe, and East Asia. This group persistently scans for vulnerabilities in the exposed web infrastructure of target organizations, exploiting discovered weaknesses to install web shells.\n\n### Storm-2603\n\nThe group that Microsoft tracks as Storm-2603 is assessed with moderate confidence to be a China-based threat actor. Microsoft has not identified links between Storm-2603 and other known Chinese threat actors. Microsoft tracks this threat actor in association with attempts to steal MachineKeys using the on-premises SharePoint vulnerabilities. Although Microsoft has observed this threat actor deploying Warlock and Lockbit ransomware in the past, Microsoft is currently unable to confidently assess the threat actor’s objectives. Starting on July 18, 2025, Microsoft has observed Storm-2603 deploying ransomware using these vulnerabilities.\n\n**Initial access and delivery**\n\nThe observed attack begins with the exploitation of an internet-facing on-premises SharePoint server, granting Storm-2603 initial access to the environment using the *spinstall0.aspx* payload described earlier in this blog. This initial access is used to conduct command execution using the w3wp.exe process that supports SharePoint. Storm-2603 then initiates a series of discovery commands, including *whoami*, to enumerate user context and validate privilege levels. The use of *cmd.exe* and batch scripts is also observed as the actor transitions into broader execution phases. Notably, *services.exe* is abused to disable Microsoft Defender protections through direct registry modifications.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nStorm-2603 established persistence through multiple mechanisms. In addition to the *spinstall0.aspx* web shell, the threat actor also creates scheduled tasks and manipulates Internet Information Services (IIS) components to load suspicious .NET assemblies. These actions ensure continued access even if initial vectors are remediated.\n\n**Action on objectives**\n\nThe threat actor performs credential access using Mimikatz, specifically targeting the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory to extract plaintext credentials. The actor moves laterally using PsExec and the Impacket toolkit, executing commands using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).\n\nStorm-2603 is then observed modifying Group Policy Objects (GPO) to distribute Warlock ransomware in compromised environments.\n\n![A diagram of a computer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Storm-2603-1024x601.webp)Figure 2. Storm-2603 attack chain exploiting SharePoint vulnerabilities and leading to ransomware\n\nAdditional actors will continue to use these exploits to target unpatched on-premises SharePoint systems, further emphasizing the need for organizations to implement mitigations and security updates immediately.\n\n## Mitigation and protection guidance\n\nMicrosoft has released security updates that fully protect customers using all supported versions of SharePoint affected by [CVE-2025-53770](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770) and [CVE-2025-53771](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53771). Customers should apply these updates immediately.\n\nCustomers using SharePoint Server should follow the guidance below.\n\n1. **Use or upgrade to supported versions of on-premises Microsoft SharePoint Server.**\n- Supported versions: SharePoint Server 2016, 2019, and SharePoint Subscription Edition\n2. **Apply the latest security updates.**\n3. **Ensure the** [**Antimalware Scan Interface**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal) **is turned on and configured correctly and deploy** [**Defender Antivirus**](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server) **on all SharePoint servers**\n- Configure [Antimalware Scan Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/configure-amsi-integration) (AMSI) integration in SharePoint, enable [Full Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/configure-amsi-integration#configure-amsi-via-user-interface) for optimal protection, and deploy [Defender Antivirus](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-on-windows-server) on all SharePoint servers which will stop unauthenticated attackers from exploiting this vulnerability.\n- Note: AMSI integration was enabled by default in the September 2023 security update for SharePoint Server 2016/2019 and the Version 23H2 feature update for SharePoint Server Subscription Edition.\n- If you cannot enable AMSI, we recommend you consider disconnecting your server from the internet until you have applied the most current security update linked above. If the server cannot be disconnected from the internet, consider using a VPN or proxy requiring authentication or an authentication gateway to limit unauthenticated traffic.\n4. **Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, or equivalent solutions**\n- We recommend organizations to deploy Defender for Endpoint to detect and block post-exploit activity.\n5. **Rotate SharePoint Server ASP.NET machine keys**\n- After applying the latest security updates above or enabling AMSI, it is critical that customers rotate SharePoint server ASP.NET machine keys and restart Internet Information Services (IIS) on all SharePoint servers.\n1. Manually using PowerShell\n- To update the machine keys using PowerShell, use [the Set-SPMachineKey cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/improved-asp-net-view-state-security-key-management).\n2. Manually using Central Admin: Trigger the Machine Key Rotation timer job by performing the following steps:\n- Navigate to the **Central Administration** site.\n- Go to **Monitoring** -&gt; **Review job definition**.\n- Search for **Machine Key Rotation Job** and select **Run Now**.\n6. **Restart IIS on all SharePoint servers using *iisreset.exe*.** NOTE: If you cannot enable AMSI, you will need to rotate your keys and restart IIS after you install the new security update.\n7. **Implement your incident response plan.**\n\nTo protect against post-exploitation activity, including ransomware deployment, Microsoft recommends the following mitigations:\n\n- Turn on [cloud-delivered protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus) in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a huge majority of new and unknown variants.\n- Read our [human-operated ransomware blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/#defending-against-ransomware) for advice on developing a holistic security posture to prevent ransomware, including credential hygiene and hardening recommendations.\n- Run [endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode) so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint – or equivalent EDR solution – can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.\n- Configure [automatic attack disruption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/configure-attack-disruption) in Microsoft Defender XDR. Automatic attack disruption is designed to contain attacks in progress, limit the impact on an organization’s assets, and provide more time for security teams to remediate the attack fully.\n- [Enable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-credential-stealing-from-the-windows-local-security-authority-subsystem) [LSA protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/credentials-protection-and-management/configuring-additional-lsa-protection).\n- Enable and configure [Credential Guard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/configure).\n- Ensure that [tamper protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection#how-do-i-configure-or-manage-tamper-protection) is enabled in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\n- Enable [controlled folder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/enable-controlled-folders) access.\n- Microsoft Defender customers can turn on [attack surface reduction rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction)to prevent common attack techniques. Attack surface reduction rules are sweeping settings that stop entire classes of threats. The following bullet points offer more guidance on specific mitigation advice:\n- [Use advanced protection against ransomware.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc#use-advanced-protection-against-ransomware)\n\n- [Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-credential-stealing-from-the-windows-local-security-authority-subsystem).\n\n- [Block process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc#block-process-creations-originating-from-psexec-and-wmi-commands).\n\n##
