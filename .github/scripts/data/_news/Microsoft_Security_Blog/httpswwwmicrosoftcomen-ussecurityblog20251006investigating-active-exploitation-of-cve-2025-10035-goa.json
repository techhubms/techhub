  "EnhancedContent": "On September 18, 2025, Fortra published a [security advisory](https://www.fortra.com/security/advisories/product-security/fi-2025-012) regarding a critical deserialization vulnerability in GoAnywhere MFT’s License Servlet, which is tracked as [CVE-2025-10035](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-10035) and has a CVSS score of 10.0. The vulnerability could allow a threat actor with a validly forged license response signature to deserialize an arbitrary actor-controlled object, possibly leading to command injection and potential remote code execution (RCE). A cybercriminal group tracked by Microsoft Threat Intelligence as Storm-1175, known for deploying Medusa ransomware and exploiting public-facing applications for initial access, was observed exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nMicrosoft urges customers to upgrade to the latest version following Fortra’s recommendations.  We are publishing this blog post to increase awareness of this threat and to share end-to-end protection coverage details across Microsoft Defender, as well as security posture hardening recommendations for customers.\n\n## Vulnerability analysis\n\nThe vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10035, is a critical deserialization flaw impacting GoAnywhere MFT’s License Servlet Admin Console versions up to 7.8.3. It enables an attacker to bypass signature verification by crafting a forged license response signature, which then allows the deserialization of arbitrary, attacker-controlled objects.\n\nSuccessful exploitation could result in command injection and potential RCE on the affected system. Public reports indicate that exploitation does not require authentication if the attacker can craft or intercept valid license responses, making this vulnerability particularly dangerous for internet-exposed instances.\n\nThe impact of CVE-2025-10035 is amplified by the fact that, upon successful exploitation, attackers could perform system and user discovery, maintain long-term access, and deploy additional tools for lateral movement and malware. Public advisories recommend immediate patching, reviewing license verification mechanisms, and closely monitoring for suspicious activity in GoAnywhere MFT environments to mitigate risks associated with this vulnerability.\n\n## Exploitation activity by Storm-1175\n\nMicrosoft Defender researchers identified exploitation activity in multiple organizations aligned to tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) attributed to Storm-1175. Related activity was observed on September 11, 2025.\n\nAn analysis of the threat actor’s TTPs reveals a multi-stage attack. For initial access, the threat actor exploited the then-zero-day deserialization vulnerability in GoAnywhere MFT. To maintain persistence, they abused remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, specifically SimpleHelp and MeshAgent. They dropped the RMM binaries directly under the GoAnywhere MFT process. In addition to these RMM payloads, the creation of *.jsp* files within the GoAnywhere MFT directories was observed, often at the same time as the dropped RMM tools.\n\nThe threat actor then executed user and system discovery commands and deployed tools like netscan for network discovery. Lateral movement was achieved using *mstsc.exe*, allowing the threat actor to move across systems within the compromised network.\n\nFor command and control (C2), the threat actor utilized RMM tools to establish their infrastructure and even set up a Cloudflare tunnel for secure C2 communication. During the exfiltration stage, the deployment and execution of Rclone was observed in at least one victim environment. Ultimately, in one compromised environment, the successful deployment of Medusa ransomware was observed.\n\n## Mitigation and protection guidance\n\nMicrosoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.\n\n- Upgrade to the latest version following [Fortra’s recommendations](https://www.goanywhere.com/resources/articles/how-to-upgrade-goanywhere-mft%22%20/t%20%22_blank). Note that upgrading does not address previous exploitation activity, and review of the impacted system may be required.\n- Use an enterprise attack surface management product, like Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM), to discover unpatched systems on your perimeter.\n- Check your perimeter firewall and proxy to ensure servers are restricted from accessing the internet for arbitrary connections, like browsing and downloads. Such restrictions help inhibit malware downloads and command-and-control activity.\n- Run [endpoint detection and response (EDR) in block mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc) so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.\n- Enable [investigation and remediation](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc) in full automated mode to allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.\n- Turn on [block mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc) in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, or the equivalent for your antivirus product, to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown variants.\n- Microsoft Defender customers can turn on [attack surface reduction rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc)to prevent common attack techniques used in ransomware attacks. Attack surface reduction rules are sweeping settings that are effective at stopping entire classes of threats:\n- [Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc#block-executable-files-from-running-unless-they-meet-a-prevalence-age-or-trusted-list-criterion)\n\n- [Use advanced protection against ransomware](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc#use-advanced-protection-against-ransomware)\n\n- [Block web shell creation for servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc#block-webshell-creation-for-servers)\n\n## Microsoft Defender XDR detections\n\nFollowing the release of the vulnerability, the Microsoft Defender Research Team ensured that protections are deployed for customers, from ensuring that Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management correctly identifies and surfaces all vulnerable devices in impacted customer environments, to building Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detections and alerting along the attack chain.\n\nMicrosoft Defender Vulnerability Management customers can search for this vulnerability in the Defender Portal or navigate directly to the CVE page to view a detailed list of the exposed devices within their organization.\n\nCustomers of Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR that might have been impacted have also been notified of any post-exploitation activity and recommended actions.\n\nMicrosoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.\n\nCustomers with provisioned access can also use [Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/security-copilot-in-microsoft-365-defender) to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.\n\n| **Tactic** | **Observed activity** | **Microsoft Defender coverage** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Initial access** | Exploitation of GoAnywhere MFT via deserialization in Licensing Service | **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** detects possible exploitation via the following alert: <br>– Possible exploitation of GoAnywhere MFT vulnerability <br><br>**Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR** can detect possible exploitation via the following alerts: <br>– Possible exploitation of vulnerability in GoAnywhere Tomcat<br>– Possible discovery activity following successful Tomcat vulnerability exploitation<br><br>**Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management** **(MDVM)** surfaces devices vulnerable to CVE-2025-10035.<br><br>**Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management** Attack Surface Insights with the following title can indicate vulnerable devices on your network but is not necessarily indicative of exploitation: <br>– [Potential] CVE-2025-10035 – GoAnywhere MFT Command Injection via Deserialization in Licensing Service <br><br>(**Note**: An Attack Surface Insight marked as potential indicates a service is running but cannot validate whether that service is running a vulnerable version.
