  "EnhancedContent": "While patchwork tools slow defenders down and impact visibility into potential cyberthreats, they’re an unfortunate reality for many organizations. As digital risk accelerates and attack surfaces multiply, security leaders are doing their best to stitch together point solutions while trying to avoid blind spots that cyberattackers can exploit. But point solutions can only go so far. For protection that keeps up with today’s fast-evolving cyberthreats, the way forward is a unified, AI-ready security platform that consolidates telemetry, analytics, and automation across detection, response, exposure management, and cloud security.\n\nIn our new e-book, **[3 reasons point solutions are holding you back](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-3-reasons-point-solutions-are-holding-you-back.html)**, we share how a unified, AI-ready platform can transform your security operations to help keep your organization safe. Read on to learn more about the key concepts in our new e-book.\n\nWhat you’ll learn:\n\n1. **The hidden costs of fragmented tools**: How disconnected solutions inflate operational costs, slow investigations, and prevent AI from delivering its full potential.\n2. **The power of unification**: Why a unified platform delivers full-spectrum visibility, predictive defense, and agentic assistance—helping teams respond faster and more effectively.\n3. **Real-world results**: See how organizations are reducing breach exposure, cutting incident response effort, and lowering costs through consolidation.\n\n[Download the new e-book and get started unifying your security operations](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-3-reasons-point-solutions-are-holding-you-back.html)\n\n## Rethinking security for the AI era\n\nAI is transforming cybersecurity for both defenders and threat actors. But disconnected tools prevent defenders from seeing the full picture and block AI from delivering its full value. Without unified data and context, AI models can’t detect subtle patterns or anticipate evolving cyberthreats. Imagine a security approach that doesn’t just react but predicts—one that turns fragmented signals into actionable insight. An AI-ready platform unifies security data into a scalable, intelligent data lake enriched with threat intelligence and mapped into a living security graph. In our e-book, we explore how this shift transforms security from a patchwork of disparate tools to a strategic advantage for organizations—delivering clarity, speed, and resilience in ways point solutions simply can’t match.\n\n**The e-book shares more about how** **AI-ready unity includes the ability to:**\n\n- Predict attack paths and prevent breaches with exposure management.\n- Rapidly remediate with AI-powered protection and improved mean time to resolution (MTTR).\n- Detect emerging cyberthreats using cyberattacker-level intelligence.\n- Continuously optimize security operations center (SOC) operations with centralized data and advanced analytics.\n\n## Measurable benefits of a unified security platform\n\nBy moving away from fragmented portfolios, organizations see dramatic improvements in efficiency and resilience. Instead of drowning in alert triage, security teams can redirect their focus to proactive remediation and prevention. And AI-powered detection shortens containment from hours to minutes—often halting ransomware before encryption begins.\n\n![A chart showing that a unified security strategy leads to better and more responsive protection. ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Picture1-1.webp)*Figure 1. A graphic showing three measurable impacts of Microsoft Defender*.\n\n## Stay ahead of accelerating cyberthreats\n\n[Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-xdr), powered by [Microsoft Sentinel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel), unifies prevention, detection, and response across ransomware, phishing, malware, and other advanced cyberthreats. Together with [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot), the stack brings AI-powered guidance and autonomous protection to investigations and response.\n\n[Get started with a unified SecOps solution](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/ai-powered-unified-secops-defender)\n\nThe e-book shares more about the key benefits, including:\n\n- **Unified foundation**: Security information and event management (SIEM), data lake, and graph in one platform.\n- **Proactive resilience**: Continuous exposure management and prioritized prevention.\n- **AI-accelerated defense**: Generative guidance and autonomous response.\n- **Operational efficiency**: Simplified onboarding, connectors, and workflows.\n- **Strategic value**: Lower costs through consolidation and higher return on investment.\n\nReady to move beyond point solutions?\n\nDownload the [**3 reasons point solutions are holding you back**](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-3-reasons-point-solutions-are-holding-you-back.html) e-book and discover how a unified, AI-ready platform can help your team stay ahead of cyberthreats and prepare for the future.\n\n[Get the new e-book](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-3-reasons-point-solutions-are-holding-you-back.html)\n\nEnvision a future where defenders and AI agents work together.
