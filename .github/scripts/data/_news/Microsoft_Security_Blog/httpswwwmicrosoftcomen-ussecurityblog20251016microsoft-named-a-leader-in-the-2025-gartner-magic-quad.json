With a centralized, purpose-built security data lake and graph capabilities, organizations gain deeper insights and richer context for more effective cyberthreat detection and investigation. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and agentic tools make data agent-ready, paving the way for seamless integration with autonomous security agents and unlocking new possibilities for proactive defense.\n\n> >\n> We realized that we needed to uplift our capability in the security operations center. We wanted a platform that could help us face the challenges of offensive use of AI so we could defend at machine speed.\n> >\n> —David Boda, Chief Security and Resilience Officer, Nationwide\n> >\n\n## **Optimizing costs and coverage**\n\nNow [generally available](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-blog/microsoft-sentinel-data-lake-is-now-generally-available/4456342), the Microsoft Sentinel data lake serves as the foundation for modern, AI-powered security operations. Purpose-built for security, it features a cloud-native architecture that centralizes all security data from more than 350 sources across platforms and clouds. The Microsoft Sentinel data lake simplifies data management, eliminating silos, and enables cost-effective long-term retention, empowering organizations to maintain strong security postures while optimizing budget. By unifying historical and real-time security data, the data lake helps AI agents and automation perform advanced analytics, detect anomalies, and execute autonomous cyberthreat responses with precision and speed.\n\nTo further help organizations optimize their security operations, Microsoft Sentinel has native features like:\n\n- [SOC optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/soc-optimization/soc-optimization-reference) helps security teams improve coverage, reduce costs, and streamline operations by providing AI-powered recommendations on data usage, cyberthreat detection gaps, and analytics efficiency. These insights empower defenders to make smarter decisions and maximize return on investment.\n- New [cost management features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/billing-monitor-costs) in preview help customers with cost predictability, billing transparency, and operational efficiency.\n\n## **Accelerating the SOC with advanced analytics and AI**\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel is transforming security operations with advanced analytics, agentic AI, and [MCP server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/datalake/sentinel-mcp-get-started?tabs=visual-studio). Microsoft Sentinel data lake centralizes security data from hundreds of sources, enabling real-time detection, contextual analysis, and autonomous response. The integration of agentic AI and [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot?msockid=13c31299ffe1622232f30313fe8b631f) allows defenders to automate investigations, correlate complex signals, and respond to cyberthreats at machine speed. The MCP server further enhances these capabilities by making security data agent-ready. Support for tools like Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries, Spark notebooks, and machine learning models within the Microsoft Sentinel data lake empowers agentic systems to continuously learn, adapt, and act on emerging cyberthreats, driving smarter, faster, and more contextual security operations across the SOC. This AI-powered approach reduces alert fatigue and accelerates decision-making, strengthening security posture across the SOC.\n\nTogether, these capabilities empower SOC teams to operate at the speed of AI, reduce noise, and focus on high-impact investigations, driving clarity, efficiency, and resilience across the security lifecycle.\n\n## **Empowering defenders with industry-leading** **SIEM**\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel enhances security operations by unifying SIEM, security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR), user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), and threat intelligence into a single, integrated experience. With full integration into the [Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender) portal, Microsoft Sentinel delivers a consolidated view for detection, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, cloud, and network—streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency for SOC teams.\n\n- Advanced correlation algorithms combine behavioral analytics, machine learning, and threat intelligence to connect events and deliver comprehensive security insights.\n- Custom rules and MITRE ATT&CK® mapping allow defenders to tailor detection strategies for their specific needs.\n- Built-in orchestration and automation capabilities reduce manual effort, accelerate incident response, and free analysts to focus on high-value tasks.\n- UEBA [powered by AI](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftsentinelblog/microsoft-sentinel%E2%80%99s-ai-driven-ueba-ushers-in-the-next-era-of-behavioral-analyti/4448390) provide deep behavioral insights to detect anomalies and insider threats.\n- Integrated threat intelligence enriches investigations with real-time insights, enabling faster detection, deeper context, and more accurate response across the SOC.\n- Embedded AI and machine learning accelerate threat detection, reduce false positives, and enable advanced hunting and automated investigations—helping SOC teams respond faster and with precision.\n\n> >\n> Microsoft Sentinel has comprehensive machine learning threat analytics models that allow us to hunt and detect any security threat, no matter how sophisticated or hidden they are. Microsoft Sentinel has intelligent security event management features which help us to accurately investigate security threats to understand the origin, making it easy to identify the most appropriate way to handle them.\n> >\n> —Software Development Project Manager, Software Industry (Source: Gartner Peer Insights™)\n> >\n\n## **Download the report**\n\nTo learn more about why Microsoft was named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for SIEM, **[download the full report](https://aka.ms/Gartner/SIEM/MQ/2025)**.\n\n## **Looking forward**\n\nAs cyberthreats grow in sophistication, the need for intelligent, adaptive, and end-to-end AI security platforms becomes more urgent. Microsoft is committed to leading this transformation by:\n\n- Investing in **agentic AI** to empower defenders with autonomous capabilities.\n- Empowering defenders with a cost-effective **data lake** for deeper insights and scalable analytics.\n- Enhancing **cross-platform integrations** for holistic protection.\n- Driving **community collaboration** through open content hubs and shared analytics.\n\nWe’re not just building tools; we’re shaping the future of cybersecurity. Our roadmap is guided by the real-world challenges faced by SOCs and the outcomes they strive for: faster detection, smarter response, and stronger resilience.\n\nWe’re honored by the Gartner recognition and deeply grateful to our customers, partners, and the analyst community for their continued trust and collaboration.\n\n[Get started with Microsoft Sentinel](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel)\n\nAre you a regular user of Microsoft Sentinel? **[Share your insights](https://gtnr.io/FVUdD9eP9) and get rewarded with a $25 gift card on Gartner Peer Insights™.**\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, visit our [website.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business) Bookmark the [Security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/) to keep up with our expert coverage on security matters.
