We’re happy to share that Microsoft has been recognized as a Leader in the [2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management](https://www.gartner.com/reprints/?id=1-2MAXOVTX&amp;ct=251113&amp;st=sb) for the ninth consecutive year. We feel this recognition underscores the impact and value of our innovative solutions, like [Microsoft Entra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra).\n\n[Explore comprehensive identity and access solutions with Microsoft Entra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra)\n\n![The Gartner Magic Quadrant showing Microsoft as a Leader. ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture1-4-scaled.webp)Figure 1. Magic Quadrant for Access Management.\n\n## Staying ahead of the evolving cyberthreat landscape\n\nEvery day, Microsoft processes more than 100 trillion signals from our services. Together with insights from researchers, law enforcement, and cybersecurity teams, these signals reveal how quickly the threat landscape continues to evolve.\n\nWe’ve observed nation-state actors and organized cybercrime groups joining forces to deploy generative AI that automates cyberattacks at unprecedented scale. With password spray or brute force attacks still accounting for more than 97% of identity-related alerts we see, more customers are turning on multifactor authentication to defend themselves.1 [Multifactor authentication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-mfa-multi-factor-authentication) also reduces the risk of identity compromise by more than 99%, making it the single most important security measure an organization can implement.1 This is forcing bad actors to evolve their tactics.\n\nUsing sophisticated phishing attacks, they trick users into authenticating on fake sites so they can intercept multifactor authentication codes and session tokens. And now they’re even using generative AI to impersonate colleagues and help desk personnel in fraudulent emails and Microsoft Teams chats, luring users into authenticating on their behalf or into granting broad permissions to malicious applications. They’re also targeting workloads, such as AI agents, which use non-human identities that may not have the same level of protection as human users.\n\nThis growing cyberthreat landscape is why a comprehensive, integrated identity and access management (IAM) strategy with strong identity governance and agentic AI controls is vital to every organization’s security posture.\n\n## A unified solution to simplify and strengthen security\n\nMicrosoft Entra is our unified secure access solution that simplifies IAM and consumer IAM (CIAM) for organizations and applications of all sizes across all industries. Instead of having to assemble multiple tools or rely on fragmented processes, security teams get a streamlined experience with centralized visibility and control.\n\nAnd since we have fully integrated generative AI into the Microsoft Entra admin center, strengthening security posture is as simple as chatting with [Microsoft Security Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot), for example, to create and troubleshoot [lifecycle workflows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/copilot-entra-lifecycle-workflow) that automate joiner, mover, and leaver scenarios. Security teams can also use natural language prompting to investigate and respond to cyberthreats to any kind of identity.\n\nWe’ve also made it easier for developers to integrate authentication into their apps with [Microsoft Entra External ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-external-id). These include AI-based tools for creating highly customized sign-up/sign-in flows and automated tools for migrating apps from Azure AD B2C or a third-party platform to External ID.\n\n>\n> *Check out more of Microsoft Ignite 2025 product announcements [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-what%E2%80%99s-new-in-secure-access-on-the-ai-frontier/4468732), including new Microsoft Entra Agent ID capabilities, expanded lineup of Security Copilot agents in Entra, synced passkeys, and more.*\n>\n\n## Investing to secure identities for the AI era\n\nA comprehensive IAM solution for non-human identities requires visibility to your organization’s AI agents. We introduced [Microsoft Entra Agent ID](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/announcing-microsoft-entra-agent-id-secure-and-manage-your-ai-agents/3827392), which creates enterprise identities for AI agents. Now identity admins can manage and govern agents using the same granular access controls and lifecycle workflows they already use to manage and govern users and applications.\n\nWe’ve also expanded Security Copilot to include agents. For example, the [Conditional Access Optimization Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/agent-optimization) detects policy gaps and provides actionable recommendations to strengthen Zero Trust enforcement and eliminate blind spots.\n\n[The Access Review agent](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/the-microsoft-entra-agent-for-smarter-access-governance-access-review-agent/4279689), currently in preview, surfaces intelligent recommendations directly in Microsoft Teams. By using AI to analyze sign-in activity, peer group changes, and unusual access patterns making access reviews faster and more secure.\n\nInnovations such as these represent the continued commitment to securing all identities and access points.
