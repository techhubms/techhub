This event is Microsoft’s largest tech conference in Europe, where data professionals gather to connect and share insights on data, security, governance, and AI transformation. With more than 130 breakout sessions, 10 workshops, and two keynotes, the conference is a hub for exploring the future of data and AI.\n\n[Secure your data with Microsoft Purview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-purview)\n\nAI innovation is transforming every industry, business process, and individual experience. As organizations adopt AI, one truth remains constant:\n\n## Your AI is only as good as your data\n\nIf poor quality, incomplete, biased, or sensitive data is fed into AI models, the results will be equally flawed, leading to sensitive data leaks and inaccurate predictions—both of which create potentially harmful outcomes and erode trust. [High quality, governed, and secured data](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/data-security-governance?msockid=27b7b3bc5be566bc06c9a5a05a7a679d) enables AI systems to deliver reliable insights and instill confidence in data usage and AI usage. Consider a team building an AI-powered customer service app. Without trustworthy data, the AI could give incorrect answers or expose sensitive information. In fact, about 99% of organizations have already experienced sensitive data exposure through AI tools, underscoring the urgent need for robust safeguards.1 Compounding this challenge, many companies address data security and governance in silos, using separate point solutions for each, and different tools across cloud platforms, which makes it harder to ensure data discovery, quality, and protection consistently.\n\nAs organizations prepare for an AI future, they require a comprehensive approach that solves both security and governance together. Microsoft Purview offers a modern, unified approach to help organizations secure and govern data across their heterogenous data estate. Purview consolidates security, governance, and compliance into a single solution. Purview also bridges different tools across different data sources like Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, and [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric), streamlining oversight and reducing complexity across the estate.\n\nAt FabCon Vienna, we are announcing new Microsoft Purview innovations for Fabric to help you seamlessly secure and confidently activate your data for AI. These updates span data security and data governance, allowing Fabric users to both\n\n1. Discover risks and protect data in Fabric\n2. Improve data discovery and quality across their Fabric estate\n\n## Discover risks and protect data\n\nIn today’s AI-powered world, data is both a powerful asset and a growing risk. Microsoft Purview helps organizations protect their data holistically by integrating Information Protection, Data Loss Prevention, Insider Risk Management, and [Data Security Posture Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dspm-for-ai) for AI. These tools work together to classify and secure sensitive data, prevent leaks, detect insider threats, and uncover AI-related risks. Paired with Microsoft Fabric, Purview builds upon existing data security such as OneLake Security while enabling innovation. Here are a few examples how Purview secures your Fabric estate:\n\n### **Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies for Fabric items and Data Loss Prevention for structured data in OneLake**\n\nNow generally available, Microsoft Purview Information Protection policies allow Fabric users to manually label Fabric items, with access controls automatically enforced according to pre-defined protection policies set by administrators. Data Loss Prevention policies on structured data in OneLake is also now generally available, preventing data oversharing in Fabric through policy tip triggering when sensitive data is detected in assets.\n\n### Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management indicators for Power BI\n\n[Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-insider-risk-management) is now generally available for Microsoft Fabric and extends its detection capabilities to Fabric by introducing built-in risk indicators for user activities in Power BI, such as viewing, downloading, exporting, and managing sensitivity labels for Power BI artifacts. These indicators can be applied directly to data theft and data leak policies, giving organizations stronger signals to spot suspicious behavior. By correlating signals across different activities, Insider Risk Management helps uncover potential insider threats such as intellectual property theft, unauthorized data sharing, or policy violations in Fabric.\n\n### Microsoft Purview Data Risk Assessments for Fabric\n\nWithin Purview’s [Data Security Posture Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dspm-for-ai) for AI, Data Risk Assessments will now support discovering overshared Fabric data (dashboards, reports, and more) in preview. Fabric customers will benefit from Data Risk Assessments by easily identifying what data is most at risk of leakage within Fabric. A default assessment will be created to identify overshared Fabric data in the top 100 accessed Fabric workspaces.\n\n![Data Risk Assessment for Fabric workspaces showing how many times sensitive data was overshared in Fabric.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Picture1-1.webp)Figure 1. Data Risk Assessment for Fabric workspaces identifying and monitoring your sensitive data in Fabric\n\n### Microsoft Purview Data Security and Compliance controls for Copilot in Power BI\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Security and Compliance controls for Copilot in Power BI are now generally available for Fabric users. Users can discover data risks, such as sensitive information in Copilot in Power BI’s prompts and responses, with actionable recommendations surfaced in Microsoft Purview [Data Security Posture Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dspm-for-ai) for AI reports. Users can also govern Copilot interactions using audit, eDiscovery, retention policies, and identifying non-compliant usage to support responsible AI usage.\n\n![DSPM for AI providing details on the AI interaction in Fabric Copilot, the user, risk level, and timestamp](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download-1.webp)Figure 2. DSPM for AI providing details on the AI interaction in Fabric Copilot, the user, risk level, and timestamp\n\nNow that we’ve covered how Purview helps secure Fabric data, the next focus is to ensure that Fabric users can use that data.\n\n## Improve data discovery and quality across their Fabric estate\n\nOnce an organization’s data is well-protected, the next challenge is making sure Fabric data consumers can find and trust the data for AI and analytics projects. This is where the [Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/unified-catalog) comes in, as a foundation for data discovery, quality, and curation across your Fabric environment. The Unified Catalog acts as a lever for data activation: it brings together powerful tools to improve data visibility and quality so that your analysts, data scientists, and AI models can easily locate the right data and use it with confidence. Estate-wide data discovery provides a holistic view of your data landscape, so data is not underutilized. Data quality tools empower teams to measure, monitor, and remediate issues in your data such as incomplete rows and columns and redundant data so business decisions are made with confidence based on the accuracy and reliability of the data. Paired with Microsoft Fabric, Purview builds upon existing data governance capabilities in Fabric such as the OneLake catalog while enabling innovation. Here are a few examples of how:\n\n### Sub item metadata in Fabric Lakehouse for comprehensive visibility of your Fabric estate\n\nIn preview, Fabric data consumers can now view metadata at the table, column, and file level in Purview, ensuring each artifact is recorded at its most granular detail for in-depth data discovery.\n\n![Schema of &lsquo;BusinessDomain&rsquo; Lakehouse table showing column names and data types as metadata](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image008.webp)Figure 3. Schema of ‘BusinessDomain’ Lakehouse table showing column names and data types as metadata\n\n### Defining custom attributes for business concepts using language your data consumers will understand\n\nIn the Unified Catalog, you can define and apply custom attributes to your data assets, which fosters better organization and utilization of your data. Now in preview, custom attributes provide data practitioners with the ability to apply specific attributes to business concepts such as glossary terms, critical data elements and data products. For a Fabric customer, this ensures that data is easier to understand and is more discoverable for usage of data workloads and AI use cases.\n\n![Associating an attribute to a data product to increase the discoverability of a Fabric Lakehouse table.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Picture4.webp)Figure 4. Associating an attribute to a data product to increase the discoverability of a Fabric Lakehouse table.\n\n### Published error records in Fabric for analysis and remediation of data quality issues\n\nNow in preview, Fabric users can identify the root causes of data quality errors directly where they work in Fabric OneLake, providing Fabric data consumers with a one stop shop for remediation of data for its use in analytics and AI.\n\n![Published error records in Fabric&nbsp;OneLake](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/download.webp)Figure 5. Published error records in Fabric OneLake\n\nThese governance enhancements empower teams to use data with confidence. A protected dataset isn’t very useful if users neither know it exists nor if they don’t trust its accuracy. Unified Catalog ensures that data assets are more discoverable and trustworthy for Fabric users\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAs organizations embrace the transformative power of AI, the need for robust data security and governance has never been greater.
