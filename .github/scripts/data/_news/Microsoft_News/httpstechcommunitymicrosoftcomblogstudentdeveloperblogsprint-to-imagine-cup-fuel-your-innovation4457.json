That’s where Sprint to Imagine Cup comes in.\n\nSprint to Imagine Cup is the first major step of the journey. For founders already building in Scale ([learn more about the two path options this year](https://aka.ms/ImagineCup2026Launch)), it’s the chance to strengthen their solution by deploying Microsoft AI in ways that meet the expectations of large organizations. For those earlier in Launch, Sprint is where an early prototype can evolve into a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Led by [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professionals (MVPs)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) and industry experts, these sessions combine trusted AI technologies, curated content, and insider guidance to help every team refine their submission and move their Imagine Cup journey forward.\n\n## Why Sprint to Imagine Cup matters\n\nThis isn’t just a checkpoint, it’s a chance to refine, test, and elevate your work. Whether you’re in Scale looking to optimize for enterprise customers, or in Launch building confidence in your MVP, Sprint to Imagine Cup gives you the structure and support to make progress that counts.\n\n## Learn From Experts\n\nAnother strength of Sprint to Imagine Cup is the community you step into. Beyond the technical guidance, these sessions create space to connect with experts and peers who understand the founder journey. Conversations with Microsoft’s MVPs, mentors, and fellow student founders open doors to new perspectives, practical insights, and lasting relationships; giving your startup not only stronger tech but a stronger network to grow with.\n\nAlongside these workshops, Sprint also offers curated content and materials so you can keep learning at your own pace. Together, these resources are designed to give you both the foundation and the edge to compete with confidence.\n\n## Your Next Step\n\nBy the end of the Sprint, you’ll have strengthened your submission through validation, iteration, and community connection. It’s an exercise in continuous improvement—testing your work, learning from Microsoft’s MVPs, and engaging with peers who share your drive. More than just an event, Sprint sets you up with the habits and insights that matter most as you move toward the semifinals, Builder Series, and ultimately the World Championship.\n\n**Tip for founders**: Don’t miss the chance to attend a Sprint to Imagine Cup session in your local area, they’re one of the best ways to get real-time guidance and inspiration.\n\n**Action**: [Check the schedule, sign up for upcoming workshops, and start making the most of Sprint today.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/student-hub/)\n\nUpdated Sep 26, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[!\\[StudentDeveloperTeam&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0yNjA2MDMtNDM1ODIxaUI5ODNCM0QyMURDNjIyOTE?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/studentdeveloperteam/260603) [StudentDeveloperTeam](/users/studentdeveloperteam/260603) Bronze Contributor\n\nJoined January 04, 2019\n\n[View Profile](/users/studentdeveloperteam/260603)\n\n/category/educationsector/blog/studentdeveloperblog [Student Developer Blog](/category/educationsector/blog/studentdeveloperblog) Connecting aspiring student developers with tools, resources and experiences to turn innovative ideas into reality.",
