So, when the chance came to actually make a Meat Boy game, we didn’t have to think twice. Our goal was to stay true to the core: fast pacing, tight controls, and ridiculous charm. At the same time, we love building strange and unique worlds — and the Meat Boy universe gives us all the room we need to get creative, chaotic, and just a little gross in the best way.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** Most of the founders at Sluggerfly studied Game Design and started working at a small German studio called Funatics. It was a great place to learn and grow. After a few years, we decided to try it on our own and started our studio. That was 11 years ago. It’s been a wild ride since then — full of tough lessons, cool projects, and the kind of chaos you only get from making games with a small, passionate team.\n\n## **Aniimo –** Pawprint Studio\n\n**Release Date:** 2026\n\n**Game description:** *Aniimo* is a next-gen open-world creature-catching ARPG set to launch in 2026.\n\n![Aniimo Hero Image](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/06/Aniimo-a09763bd91acca9e8bb8-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** The path to creating *Aniimo* started with a dream that we all used to have when we were little! *Aniimo* is the game that makes our dreams come true. The game we are presenting is the world we dreamed of and which, combined with your chosen Aniimo, enables you to enjoy a fantastic and beautiful experience. Whether it be deep open-world exploration, creature catching or socialising, we wanted to invite everyone to join a world full of joy.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** I have been a game lover since I was tiny. I used to be a programmer in the intelligent electronics industry. One day, when I finally got a chance to join the games industry and express what I felt, I took the leap without hesitation. That was 15 years ago. *Aniimo* is a dream of my childhood, and hope it will also be a dream come true for my fellow game lovers!\n\n## **Borderlands 4** – Gearbox Software\n\n**Release Date:** September 12, 2025\n\n**Game description:** *Borderlands 4* brings intense action, badass Vault Hunters, and billions of wild and deadly weapons to an all-new planet ruled by a ruthless tyrant.\n\n![Borderlands 4 Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/08/Borderlands-4-87f736f1816a32a264ba-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What was the inspiration behind your game?** Borderless Borderlands. ​ Badass Vault Hunters in a seamless, dynamic world featuring greater movement abilities, over-the-top co-op mayhem, and the highest narrative stakes yet. We wanted to paint outside the lines and give the player freedom to play the game how they wanted to play it.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** After working on a couple Unreal Engine and Quake mods with some hometown friends. Later, with fellow aspiring college undergrads, I sent out around 129 applications. 20 years ago, I got that lucky call from Gearbox Software.\n\n## **There Are No Ghosts at the Grand** – Friday Sundae\n\n**Release Date:** 2026\n\n**Game description:** When Chris David unexpectedly inherits a dilapidated English hotel, he has exactly 30 days and 30 nights to restore the crumbling edifice before it… or something else… claims him. Nothing is as it seems in the hotel – don’t believe them when they tell you that there are no ghosts at the Grand.\n\n![There Are No Ghosts at the Grand Hero Image](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/06/Hero-eb64bcc07271eb151055-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** Growing up in the UK during the ’80s and ’90s, I was heavily influenced by the films and TV I watched as a kid. We’re big fans of *Doctor Who*, especially how weird and unsettling it can be. The old Hammer Horror films were also a big influence,  full of outlandish, over-the-top, raucous characters. Musically, we drew inspiration from bands like The Clash, Madness, and The Specials. Some of those albums were on repeat during development. You’ll find a lot of those influences lurking inside *There Are No Ghosts at the Grand*.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** I started out as a graphic designer and marketing artist for video games, working on titles like *Crash Bandicoot*, *Spyro the Dragon*, and the *FEAR* games. Eventually, I moved into development as a user interface artist. Years later, while working on Friday Sundae’s debut game, that old mix of action, humour, and horror from my marketing days came back to haunt me, and helped shape *There Are No Ghosts at the Grand*.\n\n## **Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater –** Konami\n\n**Release Date:** August 28, 2025\n\n**Game description:** The core experience of the original, evolved and more immersive than ever. The same gripping story and engrossing world, now with all new graphics and 3D audio that enhance the jungle atmosphere. Get ready for the ultimate survival stealth action experience.\n\n![Metal Gear Solid Delta key art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2024/09/Metal-Gear-Solid-044df21359d2eb923e37-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** We wanted contemporary players to be able to enjoy everything that *Metal Gear Solid 3* has to offer, so we set out to remake the game for modern platforms.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** I’ve worked on almost every title in the series, starting with *Metal Gear Solid* on the PlayStation.\n\n## **Invincible VS** *–* Skybound\n\n**Release Date:** 2026\n\n**Game description:** *Invincible VS* is a brutal superhero 3v3 tag fighting game set in the Invincible universe, where you can battle to the death as a team of fan-favorite characters in iconic locations.\n\n![Invincible VS Hero Image](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/06/Invincible-917ec79ffcb853d48e0d-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** We wanted to combine our love for the Invincible franchise with our collective passion for the fighting game genre to create an authentic experience that feels visceral and brutal – one that gets you out of your seat.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** I was working in a game store, Electronics Boutique, and devs would swing by all the time. One said to me I should go apply to test games at some local studios. I soon found myself working in Quality Assurance and going to my first E3.\n\n## **Mistfall Hunter** – Bellring Games\n\n**Release Date:** 2025\n\n**Game description:** *Mistfall Hunter* is a third-person adventure game that combines action RPG with strategic PvPvE extraction looter gameplay.\n\n![](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2024/10/Mistfall-Hunter-5096f8d0d5092cffff6b-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** *Mistfall Hunter* didn’t emerge from a single spark of inspiration—it grew naturally from our team’s shared passions and long-built expertise. We drew on what we’ve always loved: fast-paced action, the thrill of extraction gameplay, and the style of mysterious dark fantasy worlds. We wanted to create a game that blends the adrenaline of intense combat with the satisfaction of strategic decision-making, all within a setting rich in atmosphere and lore.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** My journey as a game creator began long before my professional career. As a child, I designed custom card games and even wrote code on an electronic dictionary. Later, I pursued a Digital Arts program at Peking University, which paved my path into the industry. Game development isn’t just my career—it’s been a lifelong dream.\n\n## **EA Sports FC 26 –** Electronic Arts\n\n**Release Date:** September 26, 2025\n\n**Game description:** The Club is Yours in *EA Sports FC 26*. Play your way with a new gameplay experience, Manager Live Challenges that bring fresh storylines to the new season, and Archetypes inspired by greats of the game.\n\n![EA Sports FC 26 Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/08/FC26_SE_Cover_16x9-4aab19e79b1cb84dba0d-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** This year we want players to play their way with an overhauled gameplay experience in *EA SPORTS FC 26*, powered by feedback from the FC Community.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** I moved to Vancouver as a life adventure, and soon after I came across a Quality Assurance job that was focused on commentators back in 2009. After a few months helping raise the quality of the commentators I moved to the Gameplay team. Over time, I transitioned to owning bigger areas like Passing, Dribbling or Shooting. Years later I was fortunate to become the Lead Gameplay Producer and then a Production Director for the Foundations team in FC.\n\n## **Cronos The New Dawn –** Bloober Team\n\n**Release Date:** September 5, 2025\n\n**Game description:** *Cronos: The New Dawn* is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.\n\n![Cronos New Dawn Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/06/Cronos-2b44d0e5abfc39956d00-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** *Cronos: The New Dawn* carries the torch of survival horror classics, drawing inspiration from genre-defining titles while introducing a distinct vision rooted in real-world locations and philosophy. The game’s setting is heavily inspired by Kraków—specifically the Nowa Huta district (reimagined in the game as New Dawn)—a post-industrial landscape that reflects both the promise and decay of utopian ideals.\n\nBloober Team set out to explore what happens when humanity loses control of time—both literally and spiritually. This central theme shapes the narrative, where the fall of civilization, the mysterious role of the Travelers, and the soul-extraction process all point to deeper questions about sacrifice, destiny, and the fragmentation of identity.\n\n## **Final Fantasy XVI –** Square Enix Creative Studio 3\n\n**Release Date:** Out now\n\n**Game description:** The first fully fledged Action RPG in the mainline Final Fantasy series. An epic dark fantasy world where the fate of the land is decided by the mighty Eikons and the Dominants who wield them.\n\n![Final Fantasy 16 Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/06/FF16-c385130baf857d9c9436-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** Over my life, I’ve consumed an enormous amount of media and entertainment—from manga to movies to games—so I’m most likely drawing inspiration from all of that… probably without even knowing! But if asked for what influenced me most on *Final Fantasy XVI*, I would have to say the job system in *Final Fantasy V* – a game I had the opportunity to work on in my early years at Square Soft.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** My generation was one of the first to grow up with video games, so it goes without saying that they were a big part of my childhood. When I was in trade school, I had the opportunity to work as a game tester and get an “inside look” at the industry. It was about that time I started thinking game development might be a fun career to get into.\n\n## **Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade** – Square Enix\n\n**Release Date:** Winter 2025\n\n**Game Description:** The award-winning *Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade* retells the original story up to the escape from Midgar, with breathtaking visuals, fast-paced gameplay, and additional story elements.\n\n![Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/06/FFVIIRIG-fbe98d42b67c88604e3d-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** The inspiration behind the development is a fusion of nostalgia and innovation.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** When I was a child, I was fascinated by the power of storytelling and wanted to deliver emotional experiences through the medium of games.\n\n## **Onimusha: Way of the Sword** – Capcom\n\n**Release:** 2026\n\n**Game description:** Fight through bloodbaths of intense swordplay action. Explore the historic Japanese capital of Edo-era Kyoto, twisted by malevolent clouds of Malice. With every stage cloaked in mystery, danger and intrigue. Follow the tale of a samurai who wields the Oni Gauntlet, a mystical artifact. Through gritty, blood-soaked brawls, he searches for his reason to fight. What fate awaits at the end of his path?\n\n![Onimusha Way of the Sword Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/08/Onimusha-Way-of-the-Sword-d03fb02229f542a670c6-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n**What is the inspiration behind your game?** One key consideration for *Onimusha: Way of the Sword*‘s development has been how things would turn out if we used Capcom’s current technology to combine elements of Japanese historical drama depicted in the Onimusha series’ inaugural title with a “dark fantasy” world where characters battle against Genma. The game’s core pillars are in depicting the artistry, coolness, and showmanship of Japanese historical dramas. These are things I have been familiar with since childhood – things that are deeply etched in my memory. I think this influence is evident throughout *Onimusha: Way of the Sword*. Furthermore, the development team also put a great deal of effort into creating dynamic battle scenes and unique compelling characters while taking advantage of the freedoms that the fantasy genre offers.\n\n**How did you get into the games industry?** When I was young, I created an original, life-themed board game that my cousins played when visiting my parents’ home. Seeing them enjoy my creation made me happy and made me think, “I want to entertain people with things that I’ve made.” That is what led me to pursue a career in video games.",
