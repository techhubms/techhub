Across generations, our countries have stood shoulder to shoulder — economically, politically, and in a shared pursuit of innovation. From the Atlantic Charter to the digital age, the UK and the US have pursued the power of partnership. Today, this alliance enters another new chapter, as we work together to expand access to trusted American technology and strengthen the infrastructure that will drive economic growth and technological advancement in the AI era.\n\nAt Microsoft, we’ve had the privilege of being part of this story for more than four decades. And on the eve of President Trump’s state visit hosted by King Charles, Microsoft is proud to reaffirm its deep and enduring commitment to the UK — one that sets a new benchmark for transatlantic technology collaboration.\n\nToday, Microsoft is announcing a $30 billion investment we will make in AI infrastructure and ongoing operations across the United Kingdom during the four years from 2025 through 2028. This marks the largest financial commitment we’ve ever made in the UK. It includes $15 billion in capital expenditures to build out the UK’s cloud and AI infrastructure. This investment will enable us to build the country’s largest supercomputer — with more than 23,000 NVIDIA GPUs — in partnership with Nscale.\n\nYouTube Video\n\nThis investment is designed not only to meet customer demand, but to strengthen the economic ties that benefit both sides of the Atlantic. It also marks a significant step forward in the UK-US Technology Partnership, demonstrating how close collaboration is driving progress under the AI Action Plans of President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\n**Prime Minister Keir Starmer said:**\n\n“Microsoft’s landmark investment is a powerful vote of confidence in UK’s leadership in AI and cutting-edge technology.\n\n“This commitment will not only strengthen our digital infrastructure and support thousands of highly skilled jobs, but also ensure Britain remains at the forefront of global innovation as we deliver on our Plan for Change.\n\n“We are proud to partner with world-leading companies like Microsoft to build a future powered by British ingenuity and ambition.”\n\nOur capital investment will also expand our datacenter footprint to meet growing AI demand and adoption from customers across every sector in the UK — from Barclays, the NHS, the London Stock Exchange Group, the Premier League, Vodafone, UK Met Office, Unilever, and Wayve – customers that are rapidly embracing AI to transform their businesses. Vodafone has expanded Microsoft Copilot to 68,000 employees worldwide after seeing productivity gains of four hours per week during its pilot. Barclays is rolling out Copilot to 100,000 colleagues and integrating it into its own tools to unlock insights and efficiency, while developers at the London Stock Exchange Group are using GitHub Copilot and Windows 365 to dramatically accelerate secure, trusted application development.\n\nThe other half of our investment will support our ongoing operations across the United Kingdom. This includes our workforce of 6,000 employees, located in multiple sites and cities. They span the diversity of our businesses, working on advanced research, AI model development, product development, the creation of new games, the operations of our datacenters, and sales and support to customers in every part of the nation. Every day, they work in close collaboration with virtually every important British institution.\n\nAs we continue to grow our infrastructure and partnerships, we’re also strengthening the economic ties that create opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic — supporting jobs, innovation, and long-term growth in both nations. We’ve helped train more than one million people in AI skills, ensuring the British workforce is equipped for the future. And through Microsoft Research in Cambridge and Microsoft AI in London, we’re proud to contribute to the UK’s leadership in science, technology, and responsible innovation.\n\nAs we move forward, we’re encouraged by Prime Minister Starmer’s focus on growing the UK economy. Our ability to make an investment of this size is based in no small measure on the work the Government is doing to reform planning, grow electricity capacity, and foster a more stable and open regulatory environment. For AI to fully realize its potential, businesses need clarity and predictability in how they can deploy their investments, and people need confidence that these technologies are being developed and deployed responsibly — not just to build trust, but to ensure that those creating and investing in AI have the confidence to continue to do so.\n\nAs AI reshapes industries and unlocks new possibilities, we believe that trusted American technology — built on principles of security, transparency, and responsibility — can help empower UK institutions and businesses to lead with confidence. And in doing so, we’re investing in a partnership that continues to deliver opportunity, innovation and impact in both directions.",
