I mean, if you think about it, at least I got started when we were writing assembly that was code as input and the output was the machine, right? So the cognition and the metacognition for the first time was happening in code, but the execution was all machine. Then the next big thing that I got excited by and all of us got excited by is compilers came and suddenly you're coding in higher level languages. And sort of the, the, there was a shift in where you were, where the cognition and metacognition was happened and suddenly you are thinking about code as both input and output, right? So you were coding, you gave it to the compiler, it generated more code, which then drove the machine. And I, I, I still remember the first time when I took my compiler class and you know, using lex and yak, Oh my God, those are the I'm most unbelievable tools that I think I ever used because it felt so empowering to even say, oh, I can create my own language that then has its own syntax. So I was then you can think about that the next level of abstraction where I'm thinking about coding code as code. Again, that is cool. And so that has been at least when I think about it. And I was listening to the Even the morning keynote and we are sort of at the next stage of it because a new tool chain is being born right in front of us for what is the cognition and metacognition around code. It just so happens that this time around we're going to think about all these agents that are going to generate code, but you still are thinking about code and that I think. Is what's happening, and that's what is exciting.\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karaka?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Prakash Karaka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karaka?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nEmpowering Healthcare Innovation: Building Generative AI Solutions for Life Sciences Insights\n\n1h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_great-to-be-back-at-github-universe-today-activity-7389024818098212864-9_qt&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nThis shifts the center of gravity to cognition: we offload parts of reasoning to models and elevate our role to intent-setting, task decomposition, verification, and alignment with business outcomes. Metacognition becomes the core skill: How do we know this is correct? What evidence supports it? What are the failure modes, and can the system self-check and escalate? In practice: define intent, constrain context, measure fidelity with evals, log provenance, and keep humans in the loop. We’re not just writing code anymore, we’re designing control systems with conversations.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_great-to-be-back-at-github-universe-today-activity-7389024818098212864-9_qt&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_great-to-be-back-at-github-universe-today-activity-7389024818098212864-9_qt&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [2 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_great-to-be-back-at-github-universe-today-activity-7389024818098212864-9_qt&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n3 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharma-ramasamy?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Dharma Ramasamy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharma-ramasamy?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nCorporate Wellness Director | Culture & Employee Engagement | 26 yrs Corporate | Neuroscience | Board-Certified\n\n1h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_great-to-be-back-at-github-universe-today-activity-7389024818098212864-9_qt&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\n[Satya Nadella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment-text), the GitHub Universe energy is electric!
