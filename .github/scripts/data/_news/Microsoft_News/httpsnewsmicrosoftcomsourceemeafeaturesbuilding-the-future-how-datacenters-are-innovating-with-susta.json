In Exeter, U.K., government meteorologists at the Met Office make their [life-saving forecasts](https://news.microsoft.com/source/emea/features/better-forecasts-met-office-supercomputer-azure-cloud/) on a supercomputer with AI features in Azure. In Italy, government researchers are using the capacity of the cloud to crack [the genetic code of durum wheat](https://news.microsoft.com/source/emea/features/decoding-durum-wheat-dna-sustainable-future/?msockid=1933b6ae3c0b6782148fa0e33de26675) to find ways to make it more resilient to climate change.\n\nBeyond cutting-edge AI applications and supercomputing, much of our everyday digital life – from AI-powered searches and emails to photos and stored files – relies on the cloud. And what makes both AI and cloud computing possible are datacenters. Microsoft has continually expanded its cloud capacity for customers. From 2023 to 2027 alone, Microsoft will have expanded its cloud capacity in Europe by 40%. It will have operations in [more than 200 datacenters across Europe](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/04/30/european-digital-commitments/) by the end of 2026.\n\nTo meet growing demand responsibly, Microsoft set [ambitious goals](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/report/?msockid=1933b6ae3c0b6782148fa0e33de26675) to reduce environmental impact and prioritize sustainability. The company aims to be carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030. To achieve this, Microsoft is building its new datacenters with a variety of innovative approaches and retrofitting and reimagining older ones. Here are some of the ways that is happening:",
