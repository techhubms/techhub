  "EnhancedContent": "On September 30, 2025, Microsoft announced a bold new vision for security: a unified, AI-powered platform designed to help organizations defend against today’s most sophisticated cyberthreats. But an equally important story—one that’s just beginning to unfold—is how the [Microsoft Security Store](https://securitystore.microsoft.com) is bringing this vision to life through a vibrant ecosystem of partners, developers, and innovators—all contributing together to deliver more value and security to our customers. Security Store is the gateway for customers to easily discover, buy, and deploy trusted security solutions and AI agents from leading partners—all verified by Microsoft Security product teams to work seamlessly with Microsoft Security products.\n\n[Explore the Microsoft Security Store](https://securitystore.microsoft.com)\n\n## Security Store: Your gateway to stronger security\n\n[Released to public preview on September 30, 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-blog/introducing-microsoft-security-store/4456417), Microsoft Security Store brings together a diverse catalog of security solutions and AI-powered agents from Microsoft and leading partners—all in one unified experience. Whether you’re looking for advanced threat protection, identity management, compliance automation, or cloud security, you’ll find offerings from these categories and many more tailored to your organization’s needs.\n\nSecurity professionals can browse a wide range of software as a service (SaaS) solutions, from endpoint protection and data governance to cloud security and compliance. Increasingly, organizations are also turning to AI-powered agents—many of which are built on Microsoft Security Copilot—to automate triage, accelerate investigations, and deliver real-time insights. Security Store has you covered here too, with agents that represent a fast-growing area of innovation, helping security teams respond to cyberthreats with greater speed and precision.\n\nSolutions and agents are organized by industry frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, making it easy to filter by function, such as threat protection, identity management, or compliance automation. You can also browse by integration type (Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Purview) and see at a glance which solutions fit your environment and needs.\n\n>\n> **What is the Security Store?**\n> *The Security Store is the place to discover, buy, and deploy security solutions and agents that work with Microsoft Security products, helping organizations strengthen their security.*\n>\n\n![The Microsoft Security Store home page.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture4.webp)\n\nBecause Security Store is built on the Microsoft Marketplace, customers can take advantage of unified billing—purchasing solutions and agents with their existing Microsoft account, and consolidating spend on a single invoice. Eligible purchases can contribute to Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC), helping make your organization’s dollars go further. Deployment is guided and streamlined: admins can deploy solutions and agents directly from the store in just a few steps, with automatic provisioning of resources and clear visibility into where solutions have been installed.\n\n> >\n> Being able to tailor by framework or goals and see relevant solutions in one place is really valuable. The marketplace can be overwhelming, so having a focused, security-centric experience like this is a big win for us.”\n> >\n> —Sean Vaden, Vice President (VP), Security, Irth Solutions\n> >\n\nFor partners, the benefits are just as strong. Security Store leverages Microsoft’s global commerce infrastructure, enabling partners to transact in local currencies, access built-in billing and entitlement management, and reach new customers through in-app discovery and mainstream marketplace motions. Partners can monetize both SaaS solutions and AI agents, tap into Microsoft’s go-to-market incentives, and grow their business alongside a rapidly expanding ecosystem.\n\n> >\n> We’re inspired to be part of Security Store, empowering Microsoft customers with easier access to Akamai’s advanced security and agentic solutions to help them strengthen their overall security posture.”\n> >\n> —Rami Katz, VP Business Development, Akamai\n> >\n\nBy bringing discovery, purchase, and deployment together in a single place, Security Store empowers organizations to rapidly expand capabilities, respond to new risks, and drive continuous improvement. It’s more than a marketplace—it’s your one-stop shop for building a resilient, future-ready security ecosystem.\n\n## Solutions and agents for every challenge\n\nFrom day one, Security Store is focused on providing a broad selection that brings together the best of Microsoft and its partners to tackle the most pressing security challenges facing organizations today.\n\n![Screenshot showing how you can find solutions by industry standards on the Security Store. ](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/securitystore.microsoft.com_standards-for-blog-1024x802.webp)Solutions and agents can be easily discovered by industry frameworks like NIST.\n\nFrom threat protection and incident response to identity management, data security, compliance, and cloud security, Microsoft Security Store offers solutions and agents for every scenario. Offerings are tailored for security operations center (SOC) teams, IT administrators, privacy and compliance leaders, and more—each designed to integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Security products.\n\n- **Threat protection and AI agents**: Partners like BlueVoyant, Darktrace, and Illumio deliver agents that automate threat hunting, triage alerts, and provide real-time insights. For example, BlueVoyant’s Watchtower agent continuously monitors Microsoft Sentinel environments, while Darktrace’s Email Analysis Agent helps SOC teams detect and respond to phishing attacks with self-learning AI.\n- **Identity and access management**: Solutions from Invoke and Netskope empower organizations to discover, secure, and govern workload identities, enforce Zero Trust policies, and streamline compliance. Invoke’s Identity Workload ID agent flags misconfigurations and recommends best practices, while Netskope’s SSE platform integrates with Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Defender for unified, context-rich protection.\n- **Data security, governance, compliance, and privacy**: Solutions aligned with Microsoft Purview help organizations safeguard sensitive data, automate compliance, and manage privacy requirements. These offerings support robust governance and help organizations meet evolving regulatory standards.\n- **Endpoint and cloud security**: Tanium’s Autonomous Endpoint Management pairs real-time endpoint visibility with AI-powered automation, keeping IT environments healthy and secure at scale. Illumio’s breach containment agent integrates with Microsoft Sentinel to isolate cyberthreats across hybrid and multicloud environments.\n\n> >\n> Through Security Store, we’re accelerating our ability to turn extended detection and response innovation into customer impact. This is more than a marketplace. We see a new operating system for security transactability, where deployment, automation, and agentic value converge in one seamless experience.”\n> >\n> —Milan Patel, Co-founder, BlueVoyant (former FBI Cyber Division Chief Technology Officer)\n> >\n\nImportantly, Security Store features many of the most popular and widely adopted security solutions in the industry. Whether you’re looking for trusted names in endpoint protection, advanced threat intelligence, or innovative AI-powered agents, you’ll find options that are already proven in organizations around the world. This means customers can choose from both established leaders and emerging innovators, all in one place.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture5-1024x576.webp)\n\n## Building momentum\n\nIn just the first two weeks since launch, Security Store has already brought together a fast-growing catalog of solutions and AI agents from leading partners and innovators.
