In this series, you will get practical advice, tactics to start (and stop) deploying, forward-looking commentary on where the industry is going, and more. In this article, Freddy Dezeure, Deputy CISO for Europe at Microsoft dives into the global security benefits of recent European legislation.*\n\nToday’s cyberthreats are not just targeting individual enterprises—they are undermining the very foundations of our society. Hospitals where emergency care is delivered. Power grids that keep our cities running. Communication networks that connect families and emergency services. Financial systems that enable commerce and livelihoods. These aren’t abstract IT problems; they’re questions of human welfare and societal continuity.\n\nMicrosoft’s security commitments are key to tackling these challenging cyberthreats. Security isn’t simply a product feature or compliance checkbox—it’s a fundamental commitment to protecting the people, communities, and critical services that depend on Microsoft’s technology and services. These commitments also include adherence to Europe’s groundbreaking new cybersecurity regulations into meaningful protection.\n\nAfter a decade leading community cybersecurity efforts across critical infrastructure, from energy to telecommunications to financial services, I had planned to enjoy a quieter chapter. But when Microsoft approached me about joining the company as Deputy CISO for Europe, I couldn’t resist getting involved in defending one of the world’s most critical infrastructures and having impact from within. Because, at this moment in history, those of us who understand critical infrastructure security have a responsibility to act.\n\n## **The landscape we face**\n\nHuman society, the global economy, and the national security of every country in the world rely heavily on information, communication, and the operational technologies that make them possible at the speed and scale required by the modern world. Whenever these technologies face disruption, it becomes immediately clear just how reliant upon them we all are. Many organizations are ill-prepared to operate without information and communication technology (ICT). However, the current cyberthreat landscape makes the risk of digital disruptions very real, reinforcing the importance of cybersecurity and technological resilience. In short, cyber risk has become not just a material business risk, but a societal risk as well.\n\nThe findings from [Microsoft’s 2025 Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/cybersecurity/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025/) underscore this reality with striking clarity. Cybercriminals have become highly capable and organized, operating fast, at scale, and causing worldwide havoc. They’ve developed access brokerage services as a business model, selling stolen tokens and credentials to other hackers as an easy way into organizations. With AI commoditizing, even cybercriminals with limited technical expertise can expand their operations significantly.\n\nMeanwhile, state-sponsored threat actors have moved beyond their traditional realm of strategic espionage. They’re now hacking to gather operational information about their targets’ logistic operations¹ and law enforcement² organizations. These cyberattackers have also been observed deploying antagonistic cyber activities as a precursor or accompanying measure to physical war, such as the disruption of satellite communication networks.³ Recently, we’ve seen a massive increase in attacks on telecommunications companies⁴ and the exploitation of vulnerable edge devices—routers, firewalls, switches, VPNs, and mobile device management solutions. The report notes that malicious actors remain focused on attacking critical public services because when compromised, these targets have direct and immediate impact on people’s lives. Hospitals and local governments have faced real-world consequences: delayed emergency medical care, disrupted emergency services, canceled school classes, and halted transportation systems.\n\n## **How NIS2** **and DORA are transforming the CISO role**\n\nTo combat these trends, the European Union adopted two powerful new legislations: the Network and Information Systems Directive 2 (NIS2) and the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). These new legislations, as well as the factors that led to their creation, have broadened the role of the CISO so that it ideally reaches across all of an organization’s infrastructural components—IT, operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT), AI, and the supply chain. The role has become more strategic in focus through increased reporting to the board of directors and supporting their informed oversight. In my mind, this makes the role of CISO a much more complete and fulfilling endeavor.\n\nNIS2 is sweeping cybersecurity legislation, establishing a common, high level of cybersecurity across the EU by strengthening requirements for risk management, incident reporting, and governance oversight for entities operating in critical sectors. DORA was similarly adopted to bolster the digital resilience of financial entities operating within the EU. The change required by these legal provisions is far-reaching, requiring organizations to take adequate measures to manage cybersecurity and resilience risks. There are stipulations making it the duty of directors to not only approve these measures but to oversee their implementation. Directors can also be held liable for adherence and must meet new requirements regarding training, knowledge, and expertise.\n\nBoth NIS2 and DORA are quite prescriptive, writing industry best practices regarding specific mitigating measures into law—multifactor authentication, cryptography, supply chain security, red teaming, and more. They also highlight the need to implement a risk-based approach, with DORA furthermore emphasizing the need to preserve resilience. They require many organizations to review their existing risk management and control systems, including those of the supply chain, as well as clearly spelling out their cyber governance, including the defining of roles, responsibilities, authorities, and reporting structures.\n\nBut compliance in and of itself is not the end goal. What compliance with NIS2 and DORA really means is ensuring the success and continuity of governments and businesses, along with the security of citizen and customer data. Resilience becomes more robust. Compliance, really, is a guidepost by which we direct our security strategy.\n\n## **Less is more: Not all controls are created equal**\n\nThe EU legislation rightly emphasizes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity (prioritizing protections based on the likelihood of a threat and its capacity for damage) alongside the need to validate the real-world effectiveness of key mitigating controls. It underscores that resilience must be preserved as the final safeguard when other defenses fail, and places ultimate accountability for cyber risk governance on the board of directors. These guiding principles should be embraced not only by industry leaders, but also by auditors and regulators, and deployed with rigor and strategic intent.\n\nThe Microsoft Digital Defense Report reinforces why this prioritization matters. With more than 97% of identity attacks being password attacks—and identity-based attacks surging by 32% in the first half of 2025 alone—we know where to focus at this point in time. Phishing-resistant [multifactor authentication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-mfa-multi-factor-authentication) can stop more than 99% of these attacks. This is the kind of high-impact control that a risk-based approach demands we prioritize.\n\nConducting risk-based cybersecurity means prioritizing efforts to reach maximum effectiveness. Experience shows that a very limited subset of key mitigating controls can manage the most important security risks. Aiming for a complete implementation of all possible controls, as if they were all equal, is not ideal. In many ways, this represents a recalibration from the traditional framework-based deployment and audit approach.\n\nFocusing on the implementation of key controls, assuring that they’re functioning properly, and then measuring their effectiveness helps enable CISOs to create a strategic dashboard of key control indicators (KCIs) to support informed oversight. This will be an increasingly important tool moving forward, so let’s look at what one might include. The following is a list of KCIs compiled by the CISO Metrics Working Group, comprised of CISOs from large multinational corporations. It should serve us well as a starting point for determining KCIs. The first KCI in this list, which involves establishing an “inventory of ICT systems,” is by far the most important. After all, an organization cannot protect something it doesn’t know exists.\n\n| | Description | Measurement | | --- | --- | --- | | KCI 1 | ICT asset inventory | % ICT assets in inventory according to policy | | KCI 2 | Privileged accounts | % privileged accounts managed within policy | | KCI 3 | Timely patching | % high risk security updates within N hours | | KCI 4 | Reliable backups of data and applications | Maximum time to recover critical resources (% of critical resources recoverable in N hours) | | KCI 5 | Endpoint protection | % endpoints configured in line with policy | | KCI 6 | Collecting logs | % critical systems onboarded for log collection | | KCI 7 | Network security | % compliant key network security configurations | | KCI 8 | Third-party compliance | % compliant key third-party connections | | KCI 9 | Identity management | % coverage of systems and users with phising-resistant multifactor authentication | | KCI 10 | Major incidents | % major cyber incidents without business impact | | KCI 11 | Risk acceptance | Number of risk accepted policy deviations | | KCI 12 | Security of systems exposed to the internet | % of company assets exposed to the Internet adequately protected and monitored | | KCI 13 | Safeguarding platform keys | % of platform keys covered by security monitoring | | KCI 14 | Origin of cyber incidents | % security incidents related to deficiencies of at least one key control | | KCI 15 | Resilience testing | Results of resilience testing (red teaming) | | KCI 16 | Cryptography | % crypto resources post-quantum secured<br>% resources with compliant key management | | | | |\n\nThis list is not exhaustive, and the above KCIs may need to be finetuned to every organization. For example, a production enterprise may need to focus specifically on OT security and resilience while being mindful that patching vulnerabilities may not be very simple. Other mitigating measures like network segmentation would naturally also become key controls to highlight.\n\nThe EU legislation deliberately demands a risk-based approach. The bottom line here is that we should focus our cybersecurity and resilience efforts on mitigation measures that bring the highest possible benefit to our specific cyberthreat environment. Less is more, but do it well!\n\n## Microsoft\nDeputy CISOs\n\n**To hear more from Microsoft Deputy CISOs, check out the [OCISO blog series](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/topic/office-of-the-ciso/)**:\n\nTo stay on top of important security industry updates, explore resources specifically designed for CISOs, and learn best practices for improving your organization’s security posture, join the [Microsoft CISO Digest distribution list](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-subscribe-to-ciso-digest.html?lcid=en-us).\n\n![Man with smile on face working with laptop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Man-with-smile-on-face-working-with-laptop-2.webp)\n\n## **From regulation to action**\n\nComprehensive and actionable guidance for CISOs and directors can be found in the recent publication of the Dutch Cyber Security Council [Guide to Cybersecurity for Directors and Business Owners](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394485635_Guide_to_Cybersecurity_for_Directors_and_Business_Owners), which I co-authored.
