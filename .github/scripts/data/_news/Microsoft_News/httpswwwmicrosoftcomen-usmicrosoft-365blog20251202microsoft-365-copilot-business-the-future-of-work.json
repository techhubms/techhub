The bottom line: you don’t need one more point product—you need a solution that brings everything together so you can focus on growth, not gaps.\n\nMicrosoft is built to empower future-ready businesses. From world-class productivity tools that streamline work to secure, integrated AI and agents that drive better decisions and automate workflows, we help businesses stay connected and efficient. We simplify and protect your operations with robust security, reliable data management, and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system tailored for small and midsize businesses (SMBs). Microsoft delivers an end-to-end approach that enables SMBs to work smarter and thrive in a rapidly changing world.\n\n## Microsoft 365 Copilot Business\n\nFlexible Copilot plans for every organization\n\n[Get started](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/pricing)\n\n![A decorative image with the Microsoft 365 app icons on a purple ribbon](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-144522.webp)\n\n## Enterprise-quality AI, SMB-friendly price: Microsoft Copilot Business is now available\n\nMicrosoft already has a great lineup of products for small and midsize businesses; it’s getting even better this week.

Powered by Work IQ, the intelligence layer that enables Copilot to understand your business, Copilot learns how you work and who you work with, so it can anticipate your needs, automate routine tasks, and surface what matters most. That means less time spent on repetitive work and more time driving growth, serving customers, and planning for the future.\n\n## Work IQ\n\n[AI built for work ›](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-ignite-2025-copilot-and-agents-built-to-power-the-frontier-firm/#microsoft-365-copilot-with-work-iq-ai-built-for-work)\n\nIntegrated into the Microsoft 365 apps, Copilot delivers AI-powered assistance for tasks like summarizing emails, drafting documents, analyzing data, and capturing meeting notes—all without disrupting your workflow.

It also delivers AI agents—specialized digital assistants that can handle entire workflows, not just single tasks. Need to automate onboarding? Manage inventory? Improve customer resolution time? Agents can do that. They work behind the scenes to handle complexity, freeing you and your team to focus on what matters for your business. With [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio), any organization can make custom agents specific to your business processes and needs, no coding required.
