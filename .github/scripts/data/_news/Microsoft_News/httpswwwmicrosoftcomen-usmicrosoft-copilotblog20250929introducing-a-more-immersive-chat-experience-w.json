A question pops into your head, or you need to bounce an idea around—you invoke Copilot and begin a lively conversation that gets to the root of what you’re looking for. We consistently hear from customers that Voice is their favorite way to interact with Copilot and are continuing to evolve the feature. We also believe there’s so much more opportunity to leverage Voice in new ways to make Copilot even more engaging for new and existing fans—maybe you want to see more visual cues during conversations or just want things to feel more familiar.\n\nToday, as part of Copilot Labs, we’re introducing Copilot Portraits: a series of animated portraits that add to the Copilot Voice experience. These 40 pre-selected, stylized portraits include real-time voice and animations during conversations, providing a more natural flow than text-based interactions.\n\nPortraits are great for when you want to brainstorm ideas, practice for an upcoming interview, or are curious about exploring a new topic. Each portrait is intentionally stylized and not photorealistic, offering you visual variety while offering the same trusted Copilot intelligence and safety features you rely on.\n\nWe’re making Portraits available to a limited set of users today in Canada, the UK and the US through Copilot Labs. To get started, go to the Portraits section of the Copilot Labs page, browse and select the portrait that fits your preference, then choose a voice that feels right for the conversation. From there you can start a voice conversation with your portrait.\n\nWe’re taking our time with this experiment to ensure we’re providing a positive, safe, and engaging experience for everyone. In addition to maintaining the same guardrails and content filters already available through Copilot, we’re encouraging healthy usage by implementing time limits per session and per day. Portraits are only available to users 18 years or older, and we are providing clear indicators that you are interacting with AI technology. We’re going to garner feedback and continue iterating on the feature before we make it more broadly available.\n\nPlease give Portraits a try today and share your feedback. We’ll continue to share updates as we roll Portraits out to more people over time.",
