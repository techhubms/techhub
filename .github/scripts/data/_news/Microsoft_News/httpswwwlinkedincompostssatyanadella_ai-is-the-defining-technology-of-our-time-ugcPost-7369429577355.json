That's why we are so grateful to the President, First Lady, and the entire administration for making it a national priority to prepare the next generation to harness AI's power. At Microsoft, we believe delivering on the real promise of AI depends on how broadly it's diffused. And for us, that comes down to three things. First, empowering teachers and students with the latest AI tools. Second, building AI skills. With AI moving faster than any technology in history, the only way to keep up is learning by doing and getting credit for it. Third, creating economic opportunity. Every American should be able to showcase their AI. Skills and credentials to find new jobs and grow their careers. This flywheel across empowerments, skilling and new opportunity is what we want to accelerate. And that's why today we are making new commitments for students. We are announcing today that we're making Microsoft 365 personal, including Copilot free for 12 months to every college student in the United States. This includes all our community colleges and we will follow this in the coming weeks. By providing K through 12 students, teachers and staff with broader access than ever before to M365 Copilot and its chat and reasoning capabilities, making learning faster, better and more fun for teachers. We will support new training, including $1.25 million in prizes for the Presidential AI Challenge to celebrate outstanding educators in every state. And through a new partnership with the American Association of Community Colleges, we will provide no cost. AI certification for faculty serving more than 10 million students nationwide. And for students and teachers alike, we are providing LinkedIn Learning licenses that unlock AI courses, guiding learners from the basics to the most advanced AI skills. Finally, for job seekers, we are launching new LinkedIn Learning AI courses in a week long AI Learning Challenge to help people build practical in demand skills. And this is only the beginning. Together. We can open doors of opportunity for millions of Americans and build a future where AI truly empowers everyone. Thank you all so very much.\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Satya Nadella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nChairman and CEO at Microsoft\n\n1h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nRead more about our new commitments: [https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/04/new-white-house-commitments](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/04/new-white-house-commitments?trk=public_post_comment-text)/\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [29¬†Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n30¬†Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://tw.linkedin.com/in/mike-liu-voice?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Mike Liu](https://tw.linkedin.com/in/mike-liu-voice?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nAuthor of 15 Books on Language, Power & AI | Linguist | AI Communication Expert | Founder, Mike‚Äôs Strategic Communications\n\n1h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nAI is indeed shaping the future, and how we empower people with the right tools is crucial to driving positive change. Microsoft‚Äôs commitment to building AI skills and creating economic opportunities is a step in the right direction. However, we must also reconsider how AI is integrated into education to ensure we‚Äôre truly preparing future generations for its impact. I delve into this topic in my latest podcast episode, Rethinking AI Education, where we explore the necessary shifts in AI curriculum and skill-building for the next generation: Episode 38: Rethinking AI Education [https://chihchienliu.substack.com/p/episode-38-rethinking-ai-education](https://chihchienliu.substack.com/p/episode-38-rethinking-ai-education?trk=public_post_comment-text)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply)\n\n1¬†Reaction\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/madhusudhankonda?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Madhusudhan Konda](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/madhusudhankonda?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nAI Strategy & Engineering Leader | Author ‚Äì Elasticsearch in Action | Transforming Enterprises with GenAI, Search & Data Platforms | Engineering Excellence | Search Innovation & Product Engineering\n\n1h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nDear Satya [Satya Nadella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment-text), I like to offer a respectful counterpoint, Satyaji! Hear me out üòÜ\n\nWhile I certainly understand (and appreciate) Microsoft‚Äôs intent to make AI tools like Copilot broadly accessible to students and teachers, I believe that teaching through AI without first grounding learners in the fundamental principles may do more harm than good. I am always wary of creating ‚Äúblind‚Äù followers than those who rationalise and reason! Don‚Äôt we have enough of them in this world üòÖ\n\nRolling out tools like Copilot at the grassroots level indeed has appeal. But without clear instruction on why how and when these systems work (or fail), we risk creating ‚ÄúAI users‚Äù who rely on outputs blindly, rather than understanding the nature of these systems.\n\nWhat if (hear me out, Satya), instead, educational programs focused first on the underpinnings of language models the bread and butter of AI: the non-determinism, the grounding, and yes, the well-known problem of hallucinations?\n\nIf students and teachers can understand why these systems can produce confident but inaccurate results, they will be better positioned to use them effectively and ethically.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_ai-is-the-defining-technology-of-our-time-activity-7369432203736305666-Nf9O&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply)
