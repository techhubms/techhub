We also expanded in partnership with Tencent the catalog in China with mini apps and games, such as **Rednote**, **Kaipanla** and **Fire to the Zombies**, bringing even more choice to customers around the world. And lastly, we recently announced our [**2025 App Awards**](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/12/03/announcing-the-microsoft-store-awards-2025-winners/) winners, each exemplifying tremendous value for Windows users.\n\nHere are some of the other ways we strengthened the Microsoft Store this year.\n\n## Special Events: Helping customers discover more\n\n![Image of home page experience with in-app events collection popped out .](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/2.-events-1024x683.png)\n\nCustomers told us they want an easier way to discover what’s happening *inside*  their favorite apps – from new shows and seasonal game events to new features they might otherwise miss. This feedback inspired us to introduce **Special Events**, a new way to surface timely, high value content directly in the Store. We are beginning to roll out Special Events in select markets, offering a dedicated space where users can quickly find in-app experiences, game events and feature drops as they go live 1. By highlighting this content in curated collections and on product pages, we’re making it simpler for customers to stay up to date and get more out of the apps and games they already love.\n\n## Themes: Make your PC your own\n\n![Image of a themes landing page in the Microsoft Store](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/3.-Themes-1024x683.png)\n\nFor customers looking for not just apps that fit their needs, but for their PC to feel more like *their*  space, just last week we introduced a dedicated **Themes** department in the Microsoft Store on Windows, making it simpler than ever to discover and apply designs that match your style. Whether you prefer cozy aesthetics, energizing artwork, beautiful landscapes, gaming inspired looks or wallpapers from your favorite shows, the Store now offers a growing collection curated with care and craft. With streamlined browsing and installation experiences, finding a look that feels right for you is faster and more enjoyable. Learn more here: [Your PC, your personality: New themes in Store for you](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=180114).\n\n## A more personal Store experience\n\n![Image of a personalized home page experience with recommendations curated for users.](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/4.-personalize-1024x683.png)\n\nAs the Store continues to grow, it’s become increasingly important that every visit feels tailored, intuitive and relevant. As [we shared in June](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/06/05/leveling-up-your-microsoft-store-on-windows-experience/), we refined the way the Store adapts to individual interests, regional trends and timely deals, helping people discover the apps and experiences that matter most to them. Since June, we have expanded the personalized content from just the home page to apps and games pages as well. Whether someone prefers discovering new creative tools, exploring the latest games or browsing productivity essentials, the Store now does a better job of meeting them where they are. Personalized recommendations are controlled by your Store settings.\n\n## Installation made easier\n\n![Image of website showing app bundles.](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/5.-app-packs-1024x683.png)\n\nInstalling apps should feel effortless, whether you’re browsing on the web or inside the Store. This year, we made meaningful improvements to reduce friction and help people get to what they need more quickly.\n\nOn the web in select countries since November, **multi-app** **install** lets people choose a set of apps, like a productivity suite, a creative toolkit, or the essentials for social and entertainment, and install them in one click. It’s a streamlined way to set up a new device or refresh a workflow, and it’s rolling out in select markets with global expansion on the way. More details are included here: [Introducing multi-app install on Windows – Microsoft Apps](https://apps.microsoft.com/apppack).\n\nIn June, we introduced a new way for users to find, install and launch the app they are looking for through the **Windows Search Bar**.\n\nLastly, in response to community feedback we introduced **expanded inline installs** ****in Store Spotlight in October.\n\n## Helping you explore AI\n\n![Image of AI Hub page experience with agents.](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/6.-AI-Hub-1024x683.png)\n\nWe continue to see incredible energy from the developer ecosystem, with innovative new apps and experiences powered by AI continuously arriving on Windows. To help Store visitors navigate this rapidly evolving space, in February we refreshed the [**AI Hub**](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/02/18/discover-magical-ai-experiences-through-the-microsoft-store-on-windows-with-the-new-ai-hub/),****to make it easier to discover high quality AI apps and understand what they can do at a glance 2. The updated design helps people explore a growing landscape of tools, agents and creativity boosting features. As of June, on product pages, new **app badges** ****highlight when apps include AI capabilities or are optimized for Copilot+ PCs, and in the U.S., **Copilot** ****can assist with Store browsing. As of November, for Microsoft 365 users, it’s now easier than ever to find **Agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot**, which offers options like a personal analyst, researcher, prompt coach, writing coach or idea coach in supported markets 3.\n\n## Focusing on the fundamentals\n\n![Icons for a triangle, toolkit and wrench.](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/7.-fundamentals-1024x366.png)\n\nLast but certainly not least, we continued to invest in our fundamentals – including:\n\n- **Quicker Navigation**4**:** The Store app launches faster than before, thanks to performance improvements we made earlier this year. And moving between departments in the Store is now noticeably faster, thanks to new updates rolling out in December.\n\n![Before and after animation showing performance improvement,](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/8.-performance-GIF.gif)\n\n- **Improved** **Error** **Handling:** Our goal is to ensure you have an error-free experience – but when you do run into issues, we’ve clarified our messaging to help lead to a resolution.  For example, in the past mismatched region settings would block a purchase with an error message. Now, the Store automatically detects the issue and guides you to adjust your region settings, so you can complete your purchase without interruption.\n\n- **Uninstallation directly from the** **Library:** ****This has been a top customer ask in Feedback Hub – now, simply head to the Library, click the three-dot menu for an installed app and click uninstall.![Screen showing uninstallation from the library.](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/9.-Library-VERSION-2-1024x683.png)\n\n- **Better** **update** **orchestration:** Background updates are now better scheduled for smoother performance and minimal disruption while devices are in use.\n\n- **Improved** **search:** Earlier this year, we rearchitected how search works so that it is now more intent-aware, leverages signals like app updates and ratings more diligently for ranking, and addresses language-specific nuances. While these improvements mark progress, we know search is never ‘done.’ We continue to refine and we actively investigate feedback coming through the Feedback Hub to guide the next wave of improvements.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs we move into 2026, our focus remains steady: Continue improving the fundamentals, build experiences that feel thoughtful and keep listening to what you need from the Store.\n\nYour feedback continues to guide our work. Thank you for sharing it and please keep it coming through the Feedback Hub, (WIN + F) under Apps > Microsoft Store. We appreciate all your support in 2025, and we look forward to sharing more with you in 2026!\n\n*1* *Special Events launched to select devices in* *Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United* *Kingdom* *and* *the United States.*\n\n2*AI Hub is available* *in* *Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand,* *the* *United* *Kingdom* *and the* *United States.*\n\n3*AI Agents are available for M365 users in the* *Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the United* *Kingdom* *and the* *United States.*\n\n4 *Data based on internal testing and subject to factors such as device, location,* *Windows* *and Store app versions.*",
