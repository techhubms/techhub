We’re finding out just how far it fits into people’s daily rhythms, and how human its uses have become: we often turn to AI for the things that matter most like our health. We analyzed a sample of 37.5 million conversations to find out how people actually use it out in the world.\n\n(Note: our system doesn’t just de-identify conversations; it only extracts the summary of the conversation, from which we learn the topic and the intent, and maintains full privacy.)\n\nFrom health tips that never sleep, to the differences between weekday and weekend usage, to February’s annual “how do I survive Valentine’s Day?” spike, our findings show that Copilot is way more than a tool: it’s a vital companion for life’s big and small moments. And if you’ve ever pondered philosophy at 2 a.m. or needed advice on everything from wellness to winning at life, you’re in good company. So has everybody else.\n\nOur work shows that AI is all about people, a trusted advisor slotting effortlessly into your life and your day. It’s about your health, your work, your play, and your relationships. It meets you where you are.\n\nRead all about it in our [paper](https://microsoft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/What_people_do_with_Copilot-8.pdf), but here are some of our takeaways.\n\n### 1. Health Is Always on Our Minds—Especially on Mobile\n\nNo matter the day, month, or time, health-related topics dominate how people use Copilot on their mobile devices. Whether it’s tracking wellness, searching for health tips, or managing daily routines, our users consistently turn to Copilot for support in living healthier lives. This trend held steady throughout the year, showing just how central health is to our everyday digital habits. When it comes to mobile, with its intimacy and immediacy, nothing tops our health.\n\n![A line graph shows average rank over nine months for 10 topics, with each topic represented by a colored line and labeled on the right. The rankings fluctuate for each topic from January to September.](https://microsoft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top_10_Topic-Intent_Pairs-1.png)\n\n### Most common Topic-Intent pairing conversations, on mobile.\n\nHealth is consistently the most common topic while interestingly, language-related chats peak earlier in the year, with entertainment seeing a steady rise.\n\n### 2. When Programming and Gaming Cross Paths\n\nAugust brought a unique twist: programming and gaming topics started to overlap in unexpected ways. Our data showed that users were just as likely to dive into coding projects as they were to explore games—but on the different days of the week! This crossover hints at a vibrant, creative community that loves to code during the week and play during the weekends in equal measure.\n\n![Line chart showing the rank position of two topics, &quot;Programming&quot; and &quot;Games,&quot; over 31 days. Each topic&#039;s position fluctuates daily, with lines and dots tracking their most to least common ranks.](https://microsoft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/programming_gaming_blogpost-1.png)\n\n### August topic ranks for programming and games.\n\nThere is a clear change in rank between programming and games through the days of the week, with programming rising from Monday to Friday, and Games shining on the weekends.\n\n### 3. February’s Big Moment\n\nFebruary stood out for another reason: Copilot helped users navigate a significant date in their calendar year. Whether it was in preparing for Valentine’s day, or facing the day and the relationships, we saw a spike in activity as people turned to Copilot for guidance, reminders, and support. It’s a great reminder of how digital tools can make life’s important moments a little easier to manage.\n\n![Line graph showing the rank positions of &quot;Personal Growth and Wellness&quot; and &quot;Relationships&quot; topics over each day in February. Both topics fluctuate, with visible peaks and dips throughout the month.](https://microsoft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Topic_Ranks_Over_Time_-_February-1.png)\n\n### Ranking of “Personal Growth and Wellness” and “Relationship” conversations\n\nFebruary brings concerns of personal growth before Valentine’s day, with a clear peak of relationship-related conversations on the day.\n\n### 4. Late-night Sessions\n\nThe larger-than-life questions seem to have a rise during the early hours of the morning, with “Religion and Philosophy” rising through the ranks. Comparatively, travel conversations happen most often during the commuting hours.\n\n![A radial chart comparing the frequency ranks of two topics, Travel and Religion and Philosophy, with Travel marked in black and Religion and Philosophy in orange, across 23 categories.](https://microsoft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Topic_Rank_Clock_Plotly-3-1.png)\n\n### Average rank of Travel and Religion and Philosophy conversations per hour of the day.\n\nWhilst people have more travel-related conversations during the day, it’s in the early hours of the morning that we see a rise of Religion and Philosophy conversations.\n\n### 5. Advice on the Rise\n\nWhile searching for information remains Copilot’s most popular feature, we’ve seen a clear rise in people seeking advice—especially on personal topics. Whether it’s navigating relationships, making life decisions, or just needing a bit of guidance, more users are turning to Copilot for thoughtful support, not just quick answers. This growing trend highlights how digital tools are becoming trusted companions for life’s everyday questions.\n\n### Why These Insights Matter\n\nBy analyzing high level topics and intents, we manage to learn all these insights while keeping maximum user data privacy. Understanding these patterns helps us make Copilot even better. By seeing what matters most to our users—health, creativity, and support during key moments—we can design features that truly fit into their life. It’s also clear from these uses that what Copilot says matters. They show why it’s so important that we hold ourselves to a high bar for quality.\n\nThere’ll be lots more to come on this and more in the New Year.\n\n## Build the Future With Us Build the Future With Us\n\nWe’re a lean, fast-moving lab made up of some of the world’s most talented minds.
