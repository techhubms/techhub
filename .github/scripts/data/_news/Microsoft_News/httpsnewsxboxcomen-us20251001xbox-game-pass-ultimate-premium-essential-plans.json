Since launching in 2017, we’ve steadily grown our subscriber and creator satisfaction – and today, creator participation and player engagement in Game Pass are at an all-time high. But we have the opportunity for Game Pass to help more players find the creators and games they love.\n\nWe know not everyone wants the same thing in their Xbox experience, so we’re evolving Game Pass to offer more flexibility, choice, and value to all players, whether you love day one releases, discovering hidden gems, or playing across multiple devices and screens and across Xbox consoles, Xbox on PC, and Xbox Cloud.\n\nStarting today, we’re introducing three upgraded Game Pass plans based on how players play: Essential, Premium, and Ultimate. Each includes expanded game libraries, including PC titles, unlimited cloud gaming, in-game benefits (including Riot Games titles), and a revamped [Rewards with Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/rewards?msockid=1efb4690959367cf2528530694e166b5) experience. Today’s Game Pass Core subscribers will automatically move to Essential, Standard subscribers will transition to Premium, and Ultimate subscribers will remain in the Ultimate plan.\n\nIt’s all a part of our commitment to meet players where they are, so you can choose what works best for you, no matter how or where you love to play.\n\n![Game Pass Breakdown Infographic](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/10/Infographic1_SKUChooser_EN-US-Global-fc84811d1236dd22e6df-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n## **Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Just Got Its Biggest Upgrade Yet**\n\nUltimate has been upgraded for players who want the best of everything. We’re rolling out our most expansive upgrade yet, including more day one games than ever before, Fortnite Crew & Ubisoft+ Classics for the first time ever, enhanced Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming quality up to 1440p, Rewards with Xbox, and more. Now players can have it all.\n\nUltimate subscribers now get access to over 75 day one releases a year. That includes some of the most anticipated upcoming games like *Call of Duty: Black Ops 7*, *High on Life 2*, *Keeper*, *Ninja Gaiden 4*, and *The Outer Worlds 2*.  These join a growing library of more than 400 games playable on Xbox consoles, Xbox on PC, and Xbox Cloud on supported devices, with more than 45 new games added today. Think of hits like *Blue Prince, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and Hollow Knight: Silksong*, plus exclusive benefits like access to EA Play.\n\nWe’re also welcoming major additions to the Ultimate experience. Starting November 18, [Fortnite Crew](https://www.fortnite.com/fortnite-crew-subscription?lang=en-US) – an $11.99/month value – will be included in Ultimate, with access to the Fortnite Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks each month, and more. This is just the beginning of Xbox and Epic’s work together toward an open gaming ecosystem where friends can play and create together, anywhere, across devices. And today, Ubisoft+ Classics (~$15.98/month) joins Ultimate, offering access to a curated selection of Ubisoft games playable on console, PC, and cloud, like *Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag,* and more.\n\nCloud gaming is also getting a major boost. Ultimate subscribers exclusively enjoy our best quality streaming and shortest wait times, so it’s easier than ever to jump into your favorite games. Xbox Cloud Gaming has also officially exited “Beta,” as part of our commitment to make gameplay smoother and more responsive. And we’ll keep expanding the Stream your own game collection for all subscribers. Keep an eye on [Xbox.com/Play](https://Xbox.com/Play) for the latest list of cloud playable games.\n\nUltimate subscribers can now earn up to $100 per year (100k points globally) in the Store just by playing games. With our upgraded Rewards program, players can get up to 30% value on select Game Pass games, with 4x points on purchases of games and add-ons, 10% back in points on select Game Pass library titles and add-ons, and up to 20% off select Game Pass games.\n\n![Game Pass Ultimate Breakdown Infographic](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/10/Infographic3_UltimateBreakout_EN-US-Global-a43b5b4ff18734a20e2c-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n## **Xbox Game Pass Premium – More Games, More Flexibility**\n\nPremium has been upgraded to offer even more flexibility and value for those who want to play on their own terms at exceptional value. Premium provides access to a broader library of great games and extends the Xbox gaming experience across console, PC, and cloud.\n\nWe’re now giving Premium subscribers more games than ever before, from gaming’s biggest hits to hidden gems, now with access to 200+ games on Xbox console, PC, and supported devices, all still at $14.99. This library, with more than 40 new games available today, is also now playable on PC, including timeless hits like *Minecraft*, *Forza Horizon 5*, and *Grand Theft Auto V*. Plus, Premium subscribers get newly added fan-favorites like *Diablo IV* and *Hogwarts Legacy* starting today, and new Xbox-published games within a year of their launch (excludes Call of Duty titles).\n\nCloud gaming is also expanding in Premium. Subscribers now enjoy unlimited cloud gaming, including select games you own, and newly added in-game benefits in some of the biggest games like *League of Legends*, *Call of Duty: Warzone*, and *Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege X,* instantly unlocking cosmetics, characters, and more to enhance your gameplay*.*\n\nPremium also brings new value through Rewards with Xbox.
