  "EnhancedContent": "**An AI assistant that enables clinicians to streamline clinical documentation, find information fast, and automate tasks, is now available in the UK.**\n\nOn 4 September, Microsoft introduced Dragon Copilot to the UK’s NHS – an AI assistant for clinical workflow that blends Dragon Medical One (DMO) natural language voice dictation with the ambient listening capabilities of Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) Copilot.\n\nRegistered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as a Class 1 medical device, Dragon Copilot can capture clinical conversations and turn them into clinical notes. It also harnesses AI to draft documentation and automate follow-up tasks.\n\nThe goal? Ease admin pressure and improve the quality of clinician–patient interactions.\n\n**Dragon Copilot:** **Built to fit**\n\nDragon Copilot enables automated, multi-party ambient note creation, dictation capabilities, along with customisable texts and templates, AI prompts, and more by combining three capabilities in one interface:\n\n**Ambient listening** capabilities from DAX Copilot\n\n**Speech recognition** and dictation via Dragon Medical One\n\n**Fine-tuned AI** with healthcare-specific safeguards that can draft routine output from approved notes, like letters, orders and after‑visit summaries\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, more than 200 clinicians with a wide range of medical disciplines across seven healthcare organisations tested Dragon Copilot as part of a private preview programme that involved over 10,000 consultations.\n\nClinical AI assistants are transforming healthcare, offering a number of benefits for clinicians and patients alike. Dr Henry Morriss, Emergency Physician and Director of Clinical Informatics at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, who has been helping test the system, says the value of ambient voice AI starts with fidelity to the real-world consultation.\n\n“The main benefit of using ambient voice is simply that it takes your voice and your relationship with the patient, and delivers it in a method you can easily see and edit,” he says.\n\nIn high-pressure hospital settings, the gains compound, Henry says.\n\n“I spend a lot of time speaking to patients to try and work out what’s wrong. Without ambient, I’ve got to go back to the desk and type that up.\n\n“And as I come to type, I realise, ‘I’ve forgotten quite a lot of that.’ With ambient, I get back and there it is. It’s made me get diagnostic answers quicker.”\n\nIt has also “helped offload a cognitive burden – not having to type it”, giving him more time to review what was said and thus improve diagnostic clarity.\n\nWhile ambient voice AI is a powerful component of Dragon Copilot, it’s only one part of a broader clinical AI assistant designed to support end-to-end workflows.\n\nBy combining ambient listening, speech recognition, and fine-tuned generative AI, Dragon Copilot enables clinicians not only to capture conversations, but also to automate routine documentation, generate after-visit summaries, and streamline follow-up tasks. This holistic approach helps reduce administrative burden.\n\nDragon Copilot combines fine-tuned generative AI with Dragon Medical One’s speech capabilities, which have helped clinicians document billions of patient records, and Dragon Ambient eXperience’s (DAX) ambient AI technology, which has assisted over three million ambient patient conversations across 600 healthcare organisations in the past month alone.\n\nWith these ambient AI capabilities, organisations in the US have already realised significant outcomes:\n\n- clinicians reporting five minutes saved per encounter\n- 70% of clinicians reporting reduced feelings of burnout and fatigue\n- 62% of clinicians stating they are less likely to leave their organisation\n- 93% of patients reporting a better overall experience.",
