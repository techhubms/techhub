Today, that journey continues with new ways for you to express who you are every time you turn on your PC. We are beginning to rollout a new **Themes** department in the Microsoft Store on Windows, where visitors can quickly find curated and trending themes to customize their Windows devices with a single click. We’ve heard from so many of you that you want your PC to feel like your own. Maybe you’re a gamer who wants to celebrate the latest release, a fan who finds joy in seeing beloved characters each morning, a designer searching for an artfully composed background that sparks creativity every time you log in, or someone who simply wants their desktop to feel fresh and uplifting. The desire to make your device truly yours is universal. Applying a new look is simple: just one click, and your Windows device reflects your personality.\n\n![Image of Themes landing page in the Microsoft Store.](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/2.-launch-page-1024x683.png)\n\nThe new Themes department in the Microsoft Store on Windows hosts over 400 themes, over 35 of which are new to the store, each a collection of wallpapers and accent colors which can change over time, making it easier than ever to personalize your device.
