Yet despite technological advancements, genetic professionals face steep challenges in managing and synthesizing the vast amounts of data required for these analyses. Fewer than 50% of initial cases yield a diagnosis, and while reanalysis can lead to new findings, the process remains time-consuming and complex.\n\nTo better understand and address these challenges, Microsoft Research—in collaboration with Drexel University and the Broad Institute​​—conducted a comprehensive study titled *[AI-Enhanced Sensemaking: Exploring the Design of a Generative AI-Based Assistant to Support Genetic Professionals (opens in new tab)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3756326).* The study was recently published in a special edition of *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems* journal focused on generative AI.\n\nThe study focused on integrating generative AI to support the complex, time-intensive, and information-dense sensemaking tasks inherent in whole genome sequencing analysis. Through detailed empirical research and collaborative design sessions with experts in the field, we identified key obstacles genetic professionals face and proposed AI-driven solutions to enhance their workflows. ​     ​We developed strategies for how generative AI can help synthesize biomedical data, enabling AI-expert collaboration to increase the diagnoses of previously unsolved rare diseases—ultimately aiming to improve patients’ quality of life and life expectancy.\n\n## Whole genome sequencing in rare disease diagnosis\n\nRare diseases affect up to half a billion people globally and obtaining a diagnosis can take multiple years. These diagnoses often involve specialist consultations, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and invasive procedures. Whole genome sequencing is used to identify genetic variants responsible for these diseases by comparing a patient’s DNA sequence to reference genomes. ​​Genetic professionals use bioinformatics tools such as *seqr,*an open-source, web-based tool for rare disease case analysis and project management to assist them in filtering and prioritizing  > 1 million variants to determine their potential role in disease. A critical component of their work is sensemaking: the process of searching, filtering, and synthesizing data to build, refine, and present models from complex sets of gene and variant information.\n\n​​The multi-step sequencing process​​​ typically takes three to 12 weeks and requires extensive amounts of evidence and time to synthesize and aggregate information ​​to understand the gene and variant effects for the patient. If a patient’s case goes unsolved, their whole genome sequencing data is set aside until enough time has passed to warrant a reanalysis​​. This creates a backlog of patient cases​​. The ability to easily identify when new scientific evidence emerges and when to reanalyze an unsolved patient case is key to shortening the time patients suffer with an unknown rare disease diagnosis.\n\n## The promise of AI systems to assist with complex human tasks\n\nApproximately 87% of AI systems never reach deployment ​simply because they solve​​​ the wrong problems. ​​Understanding the AI support desired by different types of professionals, their current workflows, and AI capabilities is critical to successful AI system deployment and use. Matching technology capabilities with user tasks is particularly challenging in AI design because AI models can generate numerous outputs, and their capabilities can be unclear. ​To design an effective​​​ AI-based system​, one needs to identify​ ​​tasks AI can support, ​​determine​​​​​​ the appropriate level of AI involvement, and ​​design​​​​​​ user-AI interactions. This necessitates considering how humans interact with technology and how ​​AI can best be incorporated into workflows and tools.\n\n[!\\[\\](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-AI-Foundry_1600x900.jpg)](https://ai.azure.com/labs)\n\n## Azure AI Foundry Labs\n\nGet a glimpse of potential future directions for AI, with these experimental technologies from Microsoft Research.\n\n[Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/labs)\n\nOpens in a new tab\n\n## Study objectives and co-designing a genetic AI assistant\n\nOur study aimed to understand the current challenges and needs of genetic professionals performing whole genome sequencing analyses and explore the tasks where they want an AI assistant to support them in their work. The first phase of our study involved interviews with 17 genetics professionals to better understand their workflows, tools, and challenges. They included genetic analysts directly involved in interpreting data, as well as other roles participating in whole genome sequencing. In the second phase of our study, we conducted co-design sessions with study participants on how an AI assistant could support their workflows. We then developed a prototype of an AI assistant, which was further tested and refined with study participants in follow-up design walk-through sessions.\n\n## Identifying challenges in whole genome sequencing analysis\n\nThrough our in-depth interviews with genetic professionals, our study uncovered three critical challenges in whole genome sequencing analysis:\n\n1. *Information Overload*: Genetic analysts need to gather and synthesize vast amounts of data from multiple sources. This task is incredibly time-consuming and prone to human error.\n2. *Collaborative Sharing*: Sharing findings with others in the field can be cumbersome and inefficient, often relying on outdated methods that slow the collaborative analysis process.\n3. *Prioritizing Reanalysis*: Given the continuous influx of new scientific discoveries, prioritizing unsolved cases to reanalyze is a daunting challenge. Analysts need a systematic approach to identify cases that might benefit most from reanalysis.\n\nGenetic professionals highlighted the time-consuming nature of gathering and synthesizing information about genes and variants from different data sources. Other genetic professionals may have insights into certain genes and variants, but sharing and interpreting information with others for collaborative sensemaking requires significant time and effort. Although new scientific findings could affect unsolved cases through reanalysis, prioritizing cases based on new findings was challenging given the number of unsolved cases and limited time of genetic professionals.\n\n## Co-designing with experts and AI-human sensemaking tasks\n\nOur study participants prioritized two potential tasks of an AI assistant. The first task was flagging cases for reanalysis based on new scientific findings. The assistant would alert analysts to unsolved cases that could benefit from new research, providing relevant updates drawn from recent publications. The second task focused on aggregating and synthesizing information about genes and variants from the scientific literature. This feature would compile essential information from numerous scientific papers about genes and variants, presenting it in a user-friendly format and saving analysts significant time and effort. Participants emphasized the need to balance selectivity with comprehensiveness in the evidence they review. They also envisioned collaborating with other genetic professionals to interpret, edit, and verify artifacts generated by the AI assistant.\n\nGenetic professionals require both broad and focused evidence at different stages of their workflow. The AI assistant prototypes were designed to allow flexible filtering and thorough evidence aggregation, ensuring users can delve into comprehensive data or selectively focus on pertinent details. The prototypes included features for collaborative sensemaking, enabling users to interpret, edit, and verify AI-generated information collectively. This ​​approach not only ​underscores​​​ the trustworthiness of AI outputs, but also facilitates shared understanding and decision-making among genetic professionals.\n\n## Design implications for expert-AI sensemaking\n\nIn the shifting frontiers of genome sequence analysis, leveraging generative AI to enhance sensemaking offers intriguing possibilities​​. The task of staying ​​current​​​​​​, synthesizing information from diverse sources, and making informed decisions ​​is challenging​​​​​​.\n\nOur study participants emphasized the hurdles in integrating data from multiple sources without losing critical components, documenting decision rationales, and fostering collaborative environments. Generative AI models, with their advanced capabilities, have started to address these challenges by automatically generating interactive artifacts to support sensemaking. However, the effectiveness of such systems hinges on careful design considerations, ​​particularly in how they facilitate distributed sensemaking, support both initial and ongoing sensemaking, and combine evidence from multiple modalities. We next discuss three design considerations for using generative AI models to support sensemaking.\n\n## Distributed expert-AI sensemaking design\n\nGenerative AI models can create artifacts that aid an individual user’s sensemaking process; however, the true potential lies in sharing these artifacts among users to foster collective understanding and efficiency. Participants in our study emphasized the importance of explainability, feedback, and trust when interacting with AI-generated content. ​​​​​​​​​​Trust is gained by​​​​​​ viewing portions of artifacts marked as correct by other users, or observing edits made to AI-generated information​​. ​​Some​​​​​​ users​, however,​ cautioned against over-reliance on AI, which could obscure underlying inaccuracies. Thus, design strategies should ensure that any corrections are clearly marked ​​and annotated​​​​​​. Furthermore, to enhance distributed sensemaking, visibility of others’ notes and context-specific synthesis through AI can streamline the process​​.\n\n## Initial expert-AI sensemaking and re-sensemaking design\n\nIn our fast-paced, information-driven world, ​​it is essential to understand a situation both initially and again when new information arises.​​ ​​Sensemaking is inherently temporal, reflecting and shaping our understanding of time as we revisit tasks to reevaluate past decisions or incorporate new information. Generative AI plays a pivotal role here by transforming static data into dynamic artifacts that evolve, offering a comprehensive view of past rationales. Such AI-generated artifacts provide continuity, allowing users—both original decision-makers or new individuals—to access the rationale behind decisions made in earlier task instances. By continuously editing and updating these artifacts, generative AI highlights new information since the last review, supporting ongoing understanding and decision-making. Moreover, AI systems enhance ​​transparency​​​​​​ by summarizing previous notes and questions, offering insights into earlier thought processes and facilitating a deeper understanding of how conclusions were drawn. This reflective capability not only can reinforce initial sensemaking efforts but also equips users with the clarity needed for informed re-sensemaking as new data emerges.\n\n## Combining evidence from multiple modalities to enhance AI-expert sensemaking\n\n​​​The​​​​​​ ability to combine evidence from multiple modalities is essential for effective sensemaking. Users often need to integrate diverse types of data—text, images, spatial coordinates, and more—into a coherent narrative to make informed decisions. Consider the case of search and rescue operations, where workers must rapidly synthesize information from texts, photographs, and GPS data to strategize their efforts. Recent advancements in multimodal generative AI models have empowered users by incorporating and synthesizing these varied inputs into a unified, comprehensive view. For instance, a participant in our study illustrated this capability by using a generative AI model to merge text from scientific publications with a visual gene structure depiction. This integration ​​could create​​​​​​ an image that contextualizes an individual’s genetic variant within the ​​context​​​​​​ of documented variants. Such advanced synthesis enables users to capture complex relationships and insights briefly, streamlining decision-making and expanding the potential for innovative solutions across diverse fields.\n\n## Sensemaking Process with AI Assistant\n\n![Figure: Sensemaking process when interpreting variants with the introduction of prototype AI assistant.

By designing an AI-based assistant, we aim to streamline whole genome sequencing analysis, helping professionals diagnose rare genetic diseases more efficiently. Our study unfolded in two key phases: ​pinpointing​​​ existing challenges in analysis, and design ideation, where we crafted a prototype AI assistant. This tool is designed to boost diagnostic yield and cut down diagnosis time by flagging cases for reanalysis and synthesizing crucial gene and variant data. Despite valuable findings, more research is needed​​. Future research will involve testing the AI assistant in real-time, task-based user testing with genetic professionals to assess the AI’s impact on their workflow. The promise of AI advancements lies in solving the right user problems and building the appropriate solutions, achieved through collaboration among model developers, domain experts, system designers, and HCI researchers. By fostering these collaborations, we aim to develop robust, personalized AI assistants tailored to specific domains.\n\n## Join the conversation\n\nJoin us as we continue to explore the transformative potential of generative AI in genetic analysis, and please read the full text publication [here (opens in new tab)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3756326).
