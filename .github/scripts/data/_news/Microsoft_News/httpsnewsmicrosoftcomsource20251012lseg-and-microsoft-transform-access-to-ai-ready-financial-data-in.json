Through this collaboration, agents built in Microsoft Copilot Studio and deployed in Microsoft 365 Copilot can be enabled with LSEG data.\n\nBy connecting LSEG’s trusted content with advanced AI capabilities, financial services professionals can benefit from intelligent tools that enhance decision-making and productivity and lower barriers to innovation — empowering organizations to use AI responsibly and securely.\n\nToday’s announcement builds on LSEG’s AI strategy — LSEG Everywhere — which is delivering trusted licensed data to scale AI in financial services. The unparalleled depth, breadth and quality of LSEG’s AI Ready Content and taxonomies include datasets stretching back over decades and total more than 33 petabytes. Generating insights from these datasets enables Microsoft 365 Copilot users to make confident decisions faster.\n\n**Powering the build, deployment and integration of custom AI agents directly into workflows**\n\nUsing a new MCP server, LSEG customers will be able to connect with data, licensed through LSEG products like Workspace and Financial Analytics, to build AI agents in Copilot Studio. Copilot Studio provides a secure, low-code platform for users to create, customize and deploy advanced AI agents that can be integrated directly into workflows through Microsoft 365 Copilot and other applications. Copilot Studio enables makers to build sophisticated agents with ease, using frontier AI models in a fully managed SaaS experience that supports a wide range of enterprise connectors. Copilot Studio empowers organizations with robust governance controls and is natively integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot, enabling secure and compliant customization at scale.\n\nThrough Copilot Studio, users will be able to access the financial data and analytics licensed through LSEG directly within their everyday workflows to compose sophisticated AI agents, combining policies, prompts, tools and actions. This integration unifies human expertise and large language model (LLM) reasoning with LSEG’s unmatched financial data, content and analytics in a secure, governed, low-code environment. LSEG and Microsoft are currently working with customers to build their first agents in Copilot Studio powered by LSEG data.\n\n**MCP server enabling secure, seamless connectivity and industrywide interoperability**\n\nLSEG customers can also take advantage of MCP for enhanced connectivity and a unified data and AI ecosystem. LSEG has implemented this advanced protocol to make its data accessible and optimized for integration into AI enabled workflows, enhancing how LLMs interpret and use LSEG’s data. An MCP server enables the connection of Copilot Studio with LSEG APIs as well as full interoperability with customers’ own AI systems and other third-party applications.\n\nThis capability enables the transfer of datasets in a standardized environment, reducing expensive and time-intensive integration of multiple technologies for customers. This radically simplifies and speeds up the delivery of AI-enabled tools and applications that are secure, governed and scalable. LSEG data will be accessible through MCP in a phased rollout, starting with LSEG Financial Analytics.\n\nThe unique combination of Microsoft’s cloud and AI platform with LSEG’s financial data and analytics delivers differentiated outcomes for industry professionals through deeper insights and more timely, informed decision-making in a rapidly evolving market.\n\n**David Schwimmer, Group Chief Executive Officer, LSEG**\n\n“LSEG’s partnership with Microsoft is transforming access to data for financial professionals with cutting edge, AI-driven innovation at scale. LSEG customers can build, deploy and scale agentic AI directly into their workflows with secure, seamless connectivity through MCP.”\n\n**Nick Parker, Microsoft Chief Business Officer and President, Worldwide Sales & Solutions**\n\n“Our continued partnership with LSEG underscores a shared commitment to redefining the future of financial services through secure, AI-driven innovation. By combining LSEG’s trusted market data with Microsoft’s cloud and AI capabilities, we’re empowering customers to unlock deeper insights, accelerate decision-making and streamline complex workflows.”\n\n**About LSEG**\n\nLSEG is a leading global financial markets infrastructure and data provider, playing a vital social and economic role in the world’s financial system.
