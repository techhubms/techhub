But now, thanks to Microsoft Copilot, preparing for the meetings, even on short notice, was a snap.\n\n![A man sits at a desk working on a computer](https://sourcecanada.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/10/IMG_0289-1x1-1-683x683.jpg)Adi Bhatia, branch manager at Island Savings in Chemainus, British Columbia, says his team’s use of Microsoft 365 Copilot has led to smoother, more in-depth interactions with members.

You can quickly find those procedures before, rather than when they are here in your office. It’s streamlined the process, so we are definitely spending more time with the members rather than looking in the system and searching for everything when they are sitting here.”\n\nFirst West, British Columbia’s third-largest credit union with more than 280,000 members, recently became the first enterprise Canadian financial institution to deploy Microsoft 365 Copilot to every team member across its organization. More than 1,300 team members now have Copilot embedded in the Microsoft suite of tools, giving First West a powerful AI boost to assist its members.\n\nThis bold digital transformation is designed to ensure that the human touch is amplified at its branches, simplifying processes and procedures to create deeper connections with First West members — whether they are in branch, on the phone or online.\n\n“Our purpose is about empowering our members, our communities and our teams to flourish — creating health and optimism in Canadians’ financial lives,” says Launi Skinner, CEO at First West. “Technology plays a huge part in enabling us to provide personalized advice and build authentic, human-to-human relationships based on trust. Having faster access to better data and stored member information elevates our team’s ability to provide tailored financial advice that’s truly impactful.”\n\nBy integrating AI into many of the tools the teams use, Skinner points out the cultural shift that’s enabling First West teams to be more innovative and member-focused: “Copilot moves the administrative load out of the way so our advisors can be fully present with members. That means faster answers, clearer plans and a stronger human connection across every channel.”\n\n![A woman stands by a railing overlooking an atrium with her hand on a rail](https://sourcecanada.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/10/launi-skinner-1024x683.jpg)Launi Skinner, CEO of First West Credit Union, led the way in making First West the first enterprise financial services organization in Canada to provide Copilot to all its employees. Photo by Brian Howell.\n\n## Making the leap\n\nThe path to Copilot was a quick one for First West. About a year ago, members of the leadership team attended a demonstration on how the AI assistant could augment and support work functions, sparking immediate interest. From there a few people began testing the tool within the First West ecosystem. By the end of 2024, 200 to 300 licenses were handed out to early adopters within the organization to see how Copilot would work in a variety of roles.\n\nThose early adopters helped First West as they tested ways to make Copilot fit the needs of the organization. One proof of concept revolved around unstructured data – text-heavy information that isn’t organized in an easy manner.\n\n“Our teams use a wealth of information,” says Darrell Jaggers, chief transformation officer at First West. “We didn’t add more places for them to look. We made the information we already trust findable and actionable. In seconds, Copilot turns a search into an answer, orchestrating our content — policies, procedures, resources — into clear, immediate steps, so advisors can move with confidence and stay focused on the members in front of them.”\n\nOne of the elements that First West launched during the rollout of Copilot was a retail lending agent, where it was able to take the voluminous available resources – documents, procedures, updates – and put them into an AI agent for employees that quickly provided solutions.\n\n“Within seconds, advisors know exactly what to do next,” Skinner says. “The reaction was pure excitement — people were saying, ‘Wow!’ This wasn’t just a step forward; it felt like reaching the summit. It’s the solution they’ve been hoping for all along.”\n\nThe successes First West had with its early adopter group made it easier for the leadership team to roll out Copilot on a wider scale over the past six months, as many employees were excited to try the tools that had the organization buzzing.\n\n![A man wearing a blue suit in front of a white background](https://sourcecanada.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/10/paul-brodeur-911x683.jpg)Paul Brodeur, chief operating officer at First West Credit Union, says rolling out Copilot to a select group of users first created excitement throughout the organization. Photo by First West Credit Union.\n\nDemand for Copilot was organic, says Paul Brodeur, chief operating officer at First West. “Everyone knew someone that was using it. And so, it became kind of like a ‘What’s going on over there and how do I get into that?’ And I think it really created an excitement and desire to have Copilot. In change management, it’s a far easier process to have people asking for change than having change done to you.”\n\nBy starting with that user group and then having them work, learn and share together, “we could start demonstrating some quick wins the rest of the organization could have access to, and I think it was a really exciting way to roll it out to the full organization,” says Brodeur.\n\n## Crunching the numbers\n\nFor First West, mortgage renewal is an important part of their business. According to Brodeur, between Sept. 1 and the end of this year, First West will have more mortgages up for renewal than it had all last year. The process can be complex and time-consuming for its employees. In the past, they would have to go into a Microsoft SharePoint site and search through dozens of documents to help with the process.\n\nNow, First West has built an agent on top of SharePoint that allows advisors to query the documents quickly and get the step-by-step details for renewal.\n\n“We’re conservatively saving (time) per renewal,” Brodeur says. “Because usually what happens is that if an advisor isn’t 100% certain about a process, they go to their closest colleague’s desk and ask them. And so, now it’s not just their own time they’re using up to look for information, they’re actually using up a colleague’s time as well. So, to free that up has been powerful.”\n\nIn branch operations, Bhatia highlights that team members leverage Copilot’s search capabilities to retrieve a broad set of related insights, enabling more holistic preparation for member interactions.\n\n“When we query Copilot, it brings back the full picture — policies, checklists, related cases — so advisors prep holistically for member meetings,” he says. “That 360‑degree view boosts confidence: they can spot the next best question to ask and explain options clearly.”"
