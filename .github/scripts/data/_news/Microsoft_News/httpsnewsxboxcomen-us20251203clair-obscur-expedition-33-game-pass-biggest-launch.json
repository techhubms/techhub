That’s based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of its availability, which means a huge number of Xbox players joined Maelle, Gustave, Esquie, and the gang on their journey right from the beginning.\n\nSandfall Interactive creative director Guillaume Broche told us how grateful he is for all that love: “This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it’s down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality. It’s really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream.”\n\nID@Xbox Director Guy Richards explained why *Expedition 33* stood out early on as a game the team wanted to put weight behind: “From the start, Sandfall’s ambition was clear and we really felt they wanted to create something truly special, something beyond expectations for the team. Once we played early builds, we experienced their gripping story, stunning visuals and the mix of JRPG mechanics with French cultural themes that felt fresh and distinctive. It’s the kind of experience we knew Xbox players would love to discover.”\n\nFor Broche, that support from Xbox was instrumental in helping the game make as big a splash as it has. “From being there to announce our game back in Summer 2024, to coming to the studio for the [Developer_Direct video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCy6vC00O0c&amp;t=1s) in January, Xbox helped us get the word out there and reach a lot of players.”\n\nHe also noted how Game Pass allowed them to reach a much wider audience, “letting a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before. The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first.”\n\nSet in a whimsical fantasia that belies dark secrets, *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* follows the eponymous Expedition on a doomed mission to save their city from the mysterious Paintress, a godlike being that has obliterated the city’s eldest cohort every single year for decades following a cataclysm that rent the world asunder. It has captured hearts and minds all over the world for both its memorable characters and story as well as for its thrilling, savvy evolution of classic turn-based RPG battles.\n\n*Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* is a prime example of the innovative and diverse range of experiences that Xbox Game Pass was created to support, helping developers of all sizes reach a huge global audience while bringing unparalleled value to our players. Xbox is proud to have supported Sandfall in sharing this excellent game with the world, and we look forward to bringing many more exciting titles like *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33* to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on day one.\n\nIf you haven’t yet joined the Expedition, *[Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz)* is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, and Xbox Cloud.
