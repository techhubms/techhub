Led by Microsoft MVPs and industry experts, these interactive sessions are equipping student founders with the knowledge and tools to harness Microsoft AI, not only to advance their technical skills and business potential but to create solutions that drive meaningful impact across communities and industries.\n\nMicrosoft Developer Technologies MVP and Student Ambassador, [Hamza Khattak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mzeedev/), has been leading a series of Sprint to Imagine Cup events in Pakistan. The first one was in Peshawar, where more than 80 students dove into hands-on learning with GitHub Copilot, discovering how AI can enhance productivity, streamline development, and transform ideas into working prototypes in real time. “Seeing students light up as they realize how powerful these tools are is what makes this work so rewarding,” shared a two-time Imagine Cup judge (2022 and 2023) and Machine Learning engineer, [Ashley Jacob](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashleyalexjacob2000).\n\nThe momentum continued in Rawalpindi, where over 100 female students gathered to explore Model Context Protocol (MCP) led by [Arsalan Khattak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khattakdev/), who is a GitHub Campus Expert, learning how it improves model intelligence and reliability. “The energy in the room was incredible,” Lead [Microsoft Student Ambassador - Islamabad](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mlsaislamabad/posts/?feedView=all), [Ali Mumtaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-mumtaz-7b910b240?utm_source=share&amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;utm_content=profile&amp;utm_medium=android_app), shared as he reflected on the day. “You could feel the excitement as these students realized the role they can play in shaping AI’s future.”\n\nThese events show how connecting with local experts and using industry-recognized learning resources inspire students to see what’s possible.
