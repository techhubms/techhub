They’re evolving from productivity to abundance by bringing AI into every function, process, and role—they are *becoming Frontier*.\n\nLeaders in the AI era are reimagining what AI can amplify: creativity, expertise, and the human ingenuity and leadership that drives progress. A recent [IDC study commissioned by Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/idcs-2024-ai-opportunity-study-top-five-ai-trends-to-watch) shows that Frontier Firms are customizing AI for their unique workflows and seeing three times greater returns on their AI investments. Why? Because this approach keeps people at the center. They’re using AI to tackle big challenges, empower higher-value work, and help industries adapt quickly in a world where efficiency and resilience are non-negotiable.\n\n[Empower your people and drive real results with Microsoft AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai)\n\n[Becoming Frontier](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/04/23/the-2025-annual-work-trend-index-the-frontier-firm-is-born/) isn’t reserved for tech disruptors or startups. Legacy brands across industries are bending the curve on AI innovation, pairing decades of expertise with AI-first differentiation to reinvent processes and accelerate growth. In a world where more than 99% of companies fail to reach 100 years in business,1 centennial companies—brands that have been around for 100 years or more— are proving that reinvention is the key to longevity. Today, they’re using [Microsoft AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai) to eliminate the mundane and unlock creativity to accelerate their journey to becoming Frontier.\n\nCompanies including The Kraft Heinz Company, Levi Strauss & Co., Wells Fargo, and Land O’Lakes have been serving customers for more than a century and remain leading household names because they never stood still. They’re positioning themselves at the forefront of AI innovation.\n\n> >\n> When you think about how quickly humans have grasped the concepts of AI, it’s influencing how they do everyday life right now. Compared to past technologies introduced into business or corporate settings, the learning curve and the adoption rate are not something that you have to worry about as much because people are actually craving it and they’re looking for it.\n> >\n> —Ken Meyer, Chief Information Officer for Enterprise Functions at Wells Fargo\n\nThese centennial brands show that reinvention isn’t a one-time event—it’s a mindset. By pairing their own expertise with a trusted partner like Microsoft, they’re transforming operations, accelerating innovation, and setting new benchmarks for what’s possible. Let’s look at how The Kraft Heinz Company, Levi Strauss & Co., Wells Fargo, and Land O’Lakes are leading the way.\n\n## Influencing the future with the wisdom of the past\n\n![Image of the outside of the Kraft Heinz building.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kraft.webp)\n\nIn the consumer goods industry where companies are balancing shifting consumer preferences, supply chain complexity, and speed-to-market, AI-powered insights are especially crucial. The Kraft Heinz Company, one of the world’s leading food and beverage companies, is demonstrating how it is reaching for historical data as it prepares the organization to thrive in the future with the recent introduction of The Cookbook.\n\nBuilt on [Microsoft Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/models/openai/?ef_id=_k_CjwKCAiAz_DIBhBJEiwAVH2XwAcBsvQ-UAiaohTDpBehXoEbF5I0DRmabsliFXSoLEMcZPfLuePOqBoCOV4QAvD_BwE_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmm5edswduu_SEM__k_CjwKCAiAz_DIBhBJEiwAVH2XwAcBsvQ-UAiaohTDpBehXoEbF5I0DRmabsliFXSoLEMcZPfLuePOqBoCOV4QAvD_BwE_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21496728177&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADcJh_tGR1wQprSDryHUzltwtpIuN&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAz_DIBhBJEiwAVH2XwAcBsvQ-UAiaohTDpBehXoEbF5I0DRmabsliFXSoLEMcZPfLuePOqBoCOV4QAvD_BwE) and trained on a proprietary central database, The Cookbook is a proprietary AI agent that puts decades of institutional wisdom around HEINZ Tomato Ketchup production processes at employees’ fingertips. With The Cookbook, users can ask questions on everything from the thickness and color of a batch of ketchup to insights about the efficiency of production processes, and more. Preserving and digitizing institutional knowledge and subject matter expertise in this way supports improvements in production consistency, quality, and efficiency—leaning into a legacy of innovation to maintain the quality that’s made HEINZ the world’s best-selling ketchup.\n\n> >\n> As part of our long-term strategy, we’re harnessing disruptive digital solutions to fuel growth across the organization. In doing so, we’re transforming the way we work, streamlining processes, enhancing decision making, and more—all of which enable us to continue delivering the great-tasting products consumers know and love as well as continue to innovate and address evolving preferences.\n> >\n> —Oliver Ganschar, Head of Digital Product Management and Innovation at The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nThe Cookbook joins a robust lineup of generative and agentic AI-powered projects already in use at The Kraft Heinz Company to optimize marketing, production, supply chain functions, and more. They have streamlined operations for Claussen pickles, cut manufacturing waste, and dramatically reduced timelines for brand asset creation across The Kraft Heinz Company’s portfolio. The digital-first solutions empower employees to focus on high-value tasks, make decisions rooted in data, and enhance engagement.\n\n“When it comes to AI, we’re exploring integrated solutions that can drive scalability and connectivity across our organization end to end, rather than siloed deployment or disconnected applications,” said Ganschar. “We aim to create a connected ecosystem that enables our teams to work more efficiently and effectively, and this includes evaluating applications of generative and agentic AI in ways that we believe can unlock further value for our teams and the business.”\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company and Microsoft have also collaborated on a Supply Chain Control Tower to preempt interruptions and develop digital twins of the company’s manufacturing facilities to virtually test and troubleshoot new processes. Together, these efforts hone The Kraft Heinz Company’s competitive edge, strengthening its ability to get products to market faster, better serve customers, and drive innovation.\n\n> >\n> Our collaboration with Microsoft has been an important part of our digital transformation, helping us drive innovation and efficiencies through machine learning and advanced analytics so we can get products into the market faster, better serve our customers and, ultimately, deliver on consumer demand.\n> >\n> —Oliver Ganschar, Head of Digital Product Management and Innovation at The Kraft Heinz Company\n\nAs The Kraft Heinz Company looks to continue leading the curve on AI innovation, it plans to scale The Cookbook beyond HEINZ Tomato Ketchup.\n\n“We aim to use key learnings and insights from The Cookbook pilot phases to scale to other brands, products, and Kraft Heinz businesses, and we are currently in the process of exploring additional use cases for the technology,” said Ganschar.\n\n## Prioritizing data in decision-making at scale\n\n![Image of the front of a Wells Fargo banking branch.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-7426-2.jpeg)\n\nEnthusiasm around AI is not just confined to the C-Suite—it is growing throughout entire organizations. Ken Meyer, Chief Information Officer for Enterprise Functions at Wells Fargo, says employees at every level are clamoring for AI products, with more than 30,000 using Microsoft 365 Copilot since it was rolled out in June 2025. The active usage rate for enabled employees is 92%, demonstrating the value the tool offers to the employees.\n\n> >\n> It’s really a proof point saying that not only did people want to use these products, but they were waiting for it and excited about it, and what’s really exciting is understanding the usage across the different ways in which they’ve engaged: creating content, doing summarization, and researching. That’s real time saved for our Microsoft 365 licensed users.\n> >\n> —Ken Meyer, Chief Information Officer for Enterprise Functions at Wells Fargo\n\nThis kind of data is the foundation of decision-making at the 173-year-old financial institution, particularly when it comes to choosing solutions to put in the hands of employees. Analytics drove Wells Fargo’s 2021 migration to [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com) as its primary public cloud provider and guided subsequent rollouts of [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365) and [Microsoft SharePoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration) to enhance productivity and strengthen security. Now AI is increasing efficiency at Wells Fargo, with generative and agent capabilities in GitHub, [Microsoft Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/organizations), and other Microsoft AI solutions equipping employees to more effectively support clients, each other, and the organization.\n\nOrganizations across the financial services industry are seeing the opportunities AI can create to unlock greater innovation and business value at an accelerated pace. It plays a critical role in streamlining operations and compliance management—making processes more efficient and secure.\n\n> >\n> Microsoft understands what it takes to be an enterprise business and do things at scale. When you think about being in a highly regulated industry, being a bank our size, and the commitments that we have to the number of clients that we serve, it’s important and it gives us a lot of confidence.\n> >\n> —Ken Meyer, Chief Information Officer for Enterprise Functions at Wells Fargo\n\n## Weaving innovation and intuition into all operations\n\n![Image of the front of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. building](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-7426-3.jpeg)\n\nIn retail, as in finance, leaders must keep pace with their customers’ rapid adoption of emerging technologies. From evolving consumer expectations to the rise of omnichannel experiences, agility is key. Levi Strauss & Co., navigating new audiences and sales models, has partnered with Microsoft to stay resilient and innovative, using digital tools to streamline operations, personalize engagement, and scale sustainably in a fast-moving retail landscape.\n\n> >\n> Retail has always been a story of change. Microsoft is a big part of how we scale for the next 100 years.\n> >\n> —Jason Gowans, Chief Digital and Technology Officer at Levi Strauss & Co.\n\nOn the heels of a massive cloud migration to Azure, the 172-year-old company is prepared to lead in a new era of agentic AI. The first five years of a seven-year digital transformation at Levi Strauss & Co. saw streamlined workflows, improved analytics and data quality, and more robust security—enabling the company to scale AI-powered innovation across the organization.\n\nNow, [Levi Strauss & Co. and Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/source/?p=22859) are collaborating on AI-powered solutions that enhance employee decision-making, efficiency, and creativity with seamless access to insights. The newest example of this is the development of a new “superagent,” which has the intelligence to intuitively understand which applications and subagents to activate based on a user’s prompt.\n\nThe foundation of the superagent streamlines the process to develop and integrate future agents—creating substantial savings. With AI woven into every experience for employees and fans, by extension, Levi Strauss & Co. is supercharging its trajectory toward becoming a fan-obsessed, direct-to-consumer business.\n\n> >\n> We believe in performance, but our core value is also integrity. Whatever we choose to do with AI, it’s going to be grounded in making sure that it’s the right decision for our people, for the company, and for the community.\n> >\n> —Sheena Kunhiraman, Vice President of People Systems and Analytics at Levi Strauss & Co.\n\n## Modernizing a trusted resource to elevate human expertise\n\n![A warehouse worker packing Land O'Lakes butter to ship.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-7426-4.jpeg)\n\nLand O’Lakes, one of America’s premier agribusiness and food companies, is a member-owned cooperative with industry-leading operations that span the spectrum from agricultural production to consumer foods. Behind the scenes, the company has executed a [sweeping digital transformation](https://news.microsoft.com/source/2025/11/12/land-olakes-and-microsoft-partner-to-accelerate-ai-innovation-in-agriculture/?msockid=1783fe223d1565f33492ebd83ced6452): migrating more than two-thirds of its IT environment to Azure, driving widespread adoption of Microsoft Copilot, and fine-tuning its enterprise copilot.\n\n> >\n> We are not a tech company, but a tech-forward company. Having a true technology partner that helps our digital transformation was the foundation of our partnership with Microsoft. We wanted a bigger bat to swing. Microsoft gives us that.\n> >\n> —Teddy Bekele, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Land O’Lakes\n\nThis modern infrastructure is the foundation for AI innovation and serves as the backbone for a new digital assistant called “Oz.” The assistant combines the power of Microsoft AI with Land O’Lakes’ deep agricultural expertise to help farmers make data-informed decisions to maximize yield potential and mitigate risk throughout the growing season.\n\nLand O’Lakes is owned by highly knowledgeable agricultural retailers who act as trusted advisors to farmers. Historically, these retail agronomists have used the Land O’Lakes Crop Protection Guide, an 800-page agronomic resource built on 20 years of data and millions of agriculture-specific data points, to assist farmers. Oz allows retail agronomists to quickly surface critical agricultural information specific to a farm’s unique features and needs in a mobile-friendly format.\n\n> >\n> The idea has always been to make that agronomist the hero at the farm gate. Instead of flipping through a book, now agronomists can have this deep technical discussion with the AI. So, we go from a good recommendation to a highly customizable recommendation for that farmer.\n> >\n> —Teddy Bekele, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer at Land O’Lakes\n\nOz is just the latest example of how Land O’Lakes’ AI transformation has enabled them to bring cutting-edge, AI-powered solutions to the farmers they serve.\n\n## Bringing AI into the next Frontier\n\nBy thoughtfully [integrating AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai) into many levels and functions of their businesses, centennial companies are demonstrating the ingenuity and resilience that has allowed them to dynamically navigate past moments of disruption for more than 100 years.
