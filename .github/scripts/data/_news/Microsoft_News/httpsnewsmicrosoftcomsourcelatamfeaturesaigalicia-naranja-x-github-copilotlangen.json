  "EnhancedContent": "On a Friday evening last April, just ahead of Easter, Argentina’s Central Bank stunned markets by announcing the end of nearly six years of strict currency controls, lifting restrictions on the purchase of US dollars. As Argentinians absorbed the news, staff at [Galicia](https://www.galicia.ar/personas), one of the country’s largest private banks, braced for a hectic weekend.\n\nGalicia’s technology team sprang into action to enable free dollar transactions in the bank’s app before business resumed on Monday. One factor proved decisive: They used AI to expedite coding for the new feature.\n\nDevelopers at Galicia leveraged [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI developer tool that empowers teams with AI across the software development lifecycle, to deliver the updated app on time.\n\n“Code assistants help us gain the speed we need to make these kinds of things a reality… and to do it with the necessary security checks and the quality it deserves,” says Germán Gross, head of architecture at Galicia, who oversees the design and implementation of the bank’s technology systems.\n\nMarcelo Fabián Gutiérrez, a senior developer at Galicia, calls the turnaround “highly unlikely” without GitHub Copilot, which he relies on almost daily. “No doubt about it,” he says, flashing a lopsided grin. “You save time, and that extra time leads to improved work performance.”\n\n![Lines of code on a laptop ](https://news.microsoft.com/source/latam/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GitHub-Copilot-Chat-Galicia-62-2-1024x683.jpg)Developers at Galicia use GitHub Copilot chat in its three different modes: ask, edit and agent mode. Photo by Fernando de la Orden.\n\nHe adds that Copilot has made him more productive. “It’s giving teams and developers a lot more agility, which really helps us tackle more tasks.” The tool enables developers to generate full lines of code or complete functions through a variety of features, like context-aware suggestions, natural language prompts and real-time autocompletion.\n\nAcross Argentina’s financial sector, developers are increasingly using AI to write and test high-quality code faster, enhancing their own expertise and delivering better services to consumers. Many say they are learning from AI too, discovering creative solutions to resolve code problems that they hadn’t considered before.\n\nCompanies benefit as well, reaching their goals faster, attracting more customers, and accelerating technological growth – key advantages in the competitive financial industry, the tech leaders say. Bank app users enjoy quicker feature updates and improved reliability.\n\nThe financial sector – regionally and globally – is undergoing rapid transformation, with new digital banks entering the market and traditional banks adapting fast to avoid losing market share. In Argentina, a long history of inflation, currency controls and economic uncertainty have shaped an even more complex environment.",
