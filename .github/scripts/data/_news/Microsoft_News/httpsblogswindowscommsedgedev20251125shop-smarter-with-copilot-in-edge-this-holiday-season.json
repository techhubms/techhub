Between planning parties and putting up decorations, where is the time to go down your shopping list? Microsoft Edge is here to help with a new streamlined shopping experience to add cheer to your holidays.\n\nYour favorite shopping features – Cashback, Price comparison, Price history, Product insights, and Price tracking – are now coming to Copilot in Edge to make shopping even smarter. And to supercharge your shopping experience, users will see proactive cashback and savings offers in Copilot Mode in Edge.\n\n## Your personal, AI-powered shopping assistant – right in your browser\n\nCopilot is seamlessly integrated into Microsoft Edge and starting today we are offering tools like **Cashback, Price Comparison, Price History, Product Insights, and Price Tracking directly within Copilot in Edge**, in the US only. You can interact with Copilot from the top right-hand corner of your browser window. Think of Copilot in Edge as the shopping assistant you’ve always wanted, helping you save time and money, and shop with confidence.\n\nWhen you’re on a supported retailer page1, you can click on the Copilot icon and Copilot will show you a product insights card with information such as price comparison with other retailers, price history for the item you’re looking for, and product insights to help you make your decision better. You’ll be able to set price alerts for the items you want, so you can get the best price on what you’re looking for. Because Copilot is conversational, you’ll also be able to ask follow-up questions and more details all within the same side pane – everything in one AI-powered experience right in your browser window.\n\n[!\\[\\](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/themes/microsoft-stories-theme/img/theme/shims/16x9.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGBP0rEe3Vw)\n\n## Get even more with Copilot Mode in Edge\n\nWe know you’re pressed for time, especially during this busy season. This is why I’m excited today to announce that in addition to the features listed above, for users in the US, **Copilot Mode in Edge can now notify you if there is a better price available elsewhere and if there are any cashback deals**. Shopping for gifts often means comparing different options, which usually entails having multiple tabs open in search of the perfect present. Copilot Mode in Edge can proactively notify you when a better deal is available at another retailer and help you put those savings toward more holiday treats.\n\n[!\\[\\](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/themes/microsoft-stories-theme/img/theme/shims/16x9.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq9-3HhUkhs)\n\nYou can toggle on Copilot Mode from the [website](https://aka.ms/copilot-mode) and you’re fully in control. You can choose to turn the experience on and off as you wish through your Edge settings. If you choose not to turn on Copilot Mode, you can continue to browse on Edge as usual. Learn more about other Copilot Mode features [here](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/10/23/meet-copilot-mode-in-edge-your-ai-browser/).\n\n## Happy shopping!\n\nI hope these tools have arrived just in time to help you shop smarter, save you time, save you money – and bring more joy and fun back into the holiday season. Stay tuned for more news from us as we continue to innovate and bring you ways to shop with confidence.\n\nRemember, if you’re running a Windows PC, you already have Microsoft Edge installed, so [check it out](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/copilot-mode?form=MA140Q&#038;cs=2245940606) and see why Microsoft Edge is the smarter way to browse.
