  "EnhancedContent": "This week, we’re bringing AI-powered building to employees across the organization, with **new agents for [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot) customers in the [Frontier program](https://adoption.microsoft.com/copilot/frontier-program/): App Builder and Workflows**. Using these agents and Copilot Studio, Copilot now enables employees to turn ideas into impact by creating apps, workflows, and agents—just as easily as having a conversation. Describe what you need in natural language, and Copilot helps you build it. And because the outputs are integrated with your Copilot experience, they’re secure, governed, and connected to your Microsoft 365 data.\n\nImagine you’re preparing for a product launch. With a few multi-turn interactions, Copilot helps you build what you need for success:\n\n- **Apps:** *Create an app for a product launch process where teams can track launch milestones, assign tasks, and view campaign progress in a dashboard.*\n- **Flows:** *Send a Teams update every Monday with upcoming launch deadlines and key tasks from Planner. Post reminders for approval deadlines in Teams channels.*\n- **Agents:** *Build an agent that answers product launch questions—like what the next milestone is, how to submit creative assets, or when the launch event is—using SharePoint resources and Teams conversations.*\n\n## Build working apps in minutes\n\n![A preview of the App Builder agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/App-Builder-GIF-1920.gif)\n\nThis week, Copilot will include **[App Builder](https://aka.ms/AppBuilderAgentLearn)**, making it easy to create and deploy apps in minutes, no database setup required. Work with App Builder to create and refine dashboards, charts, calculators, lists, and any other interactive element you can dream up. You can preview and refine your app, over multiple edits and comments, without leaving Copilot.\n\nThe experience is grounded in your Microsoft 365 content, including documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and notes, and can even generate and store new data using Microsoft Lists as a backend. Sharing is just as simple: Distribute your app with a link, just like you would share a document.\n\nLearn more from [the people who built App Builder](https://aka.ms/AppBuilderAgent/SpotlightVideo).\n\n[Learn more about App Builder](https://aka.ms/GetAppBuilderAgent)\n\n## Automate workflows in seconds\n\n![A preview of Workflows Agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Workflows-agent-GIF-1920.gif)\n\nWith the new **[Workflows agent](https://aka.ms/FlowBuilder/Docs/Sept)**, Copilot can help you automate tasks like sending emails and reminders, managing calendars, and sharing team updates. Just describe what you want, and Copilot converts your words into automated flows across Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, Planner, and services like Approvals.\n\nAs the flow builds, you’ll see each step in real time, making it easy to follow and understand the workflow. If you want to add more steps, or adjust behaviors, you can make requests in the same conversation with Copilot.\n\nWorkflows is optimized for end users but built on the same infrastructure that powers [Agent Flows](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/introducing-agent-flows-transforming-automation-with-ai-first-workflows/) in the full Copilot Studio experience. This shared foundation delivers enterprise-grade reliability to personal automation.\n\nLearn more from [the people who built Workflows](https://aka.ms/WorkflowsAgent/Spotlight).\n\n[Create your ideal workflow with Copilot](https://aka.ms/WorkflowsAgent)\n\n## Create personalized, work-grounded agents\n\n![Microsoft Copilot Studio building an agent.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Copilot-Studio-lite-GIF-1920.gif)\n\nBuilt into Copilot, the lightweight **Copilot Studio** experience makes it easy to create productivity-focused agents grounded in your work. Copilot Studio turns your words into a fully functional agent with structured logic and clear instructions. Earlier this year, we enhanced Copilot Studio to connect agents more deeply to your work, pulling from SharePoint, meeting transcripts, chats, emails, and external systems like ServiceNow and Jira.\n\nWhen you’re ready to scale, the full [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/) experience unlocks advanced workflows, model selection, collaborative multi-agent systems, and more—taking you from productivity agents to IT-led, enterprise-wide solutions.\n\nLearn more from [the people who built Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/CopilotStudioLite/Spotlight).\n\n## Secure, governed, and integrated with Microsoft 365 Copilot\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is built on enterprise-grade security, compliance, and reliability. App Builder, Workflows, and Copilot Studio lite are built on these same principles. These agents respect user context, enforcing individual permissions and role-based access to support governance. They are available exclusively through Microsoft 365 which helps ensure all activity stays secure, compliant, and aligned with organizational policies.\n\nFor admins, management is streamlined with unified permissions, visibility, and controls across the organization. Access to these conversational AI building tools can be managed in the [agent inventory section of the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps?view=o365-worldwide), so there’s no need for one-by-one guardrails. This allows for granular control at the group level, helping to ensure that only approved individuals can create, use, or share apps, flows, and agents, while maintaining compliance with organizational policies.\n\n## Build with Copilot today\n\n[**Workflows**](https://aka.ms/WorkflowsAgent) is now available in the Agent Store for customers in the [Frontier program](https://adoption.microsoft.com/copilot/frontier-program/), with App Builder coming this week. You can easily create your own personalized agent by selecting “[**Create agent**](https://office.com/chat/agent/new)” in Copilot. Microsoft 365 Copilot makes it easy to build what you need, whether it’s an app, a workflow, or an agent.\n\nLearn more about [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/copilot), [Workflows](https://aka.ms/FlowBuilder/Docs/Sept), [App Builder](https://aka.ms/AppBuilderAgentLearn), and [Copilot Studio](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/build-your-own-agent-with-microsoft-365-copilot-ee209698-16bd-4d5c-9e4a-a999528c9d00).
