[Copilot Studio](https://aka.ms/CopilotStudio), Copilot’s agent platform, provides a fully managed solution for accomplishing this.\n\nUsing Copilot Studio, organizations around the world can quickly bring the benefits of AI to their business.

These servers allow agents to schedule meetings in Microsoft Teams, draft documents in Word, send emails in Outlook, and update customer relationship management (CRM) records in [Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365). This supports delivery of intelligent, compliant workflows and agents with built-in audit trails and granular policy enforcement—all from one platform.\n\nAgent 365 is available starting today in Microsoft 365 Admin Center with [Frontier](https://adoption.microsoft.com/copilot/frontier-program/), Microsoft’s early access program for the latest AI innovations.\n\n![Microsoft 365 Admin Center shows the All Agents page for monitoring and managing 26,350 agents.
