Whether you’re playing locally or streaming from your console or the cloud, it’s all right there, ready when you are.\n\nThis launch reflects the efforts of many—from the players who shaped the journey through early feedback, to the game creators who built the games you’ll play today.

Over 55 new titles were added last month, giving you more ways to play wherever you go. To make it even easier to discover new favorites, players in select markets will also receive three months of **Xbox Game Pass Premium or PC Game Pass** (where available) with the purchase of an Xbox Ally handheld. Premium, which now offers unlimited cloud gaming and access to PC titles, gives you a library of over 200 great games to jump into anytime, anywhere.

Whether it’s high-speed storage to carry more of your library, or a premium case built for travel, you’ll have more ways to personalize your handheld experience.\n\n- We are committed to empowering everyone to play in a way that works for them, including the 425 million players with disabilities across the globe.

Together with ASUS, AMD, and Windows, we’re committed to pushing handheld gaming further, guided by your feedback and powered by deep collaboration. That means ongoing improvements to performance, battery life, handheld compatibility, and new features on the Xbox Ally handhelds in the months ahead.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Xbox Ally players can look forward to previewing **Default Game Profiles,** a new feature that balances frame rate and energy use for select titles to give players smooth, enjoyable gameplay while extending battery life. And that’s just the beginning. Early next year, we will also roll out enhancements to the docking experience for both Xbox Ally handhelds, introduce AI-powered features like Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR) and highlight reels for the Xbox Ally X, and much more.\n\n**What’s most exciting is that many of these innovations are designed to scale across all Windows devices**—some are available today, and others are on the way. Features like enhanced controller navigation, Gaming Copilot (Beta), and aggregated gaming library via the Xbox App are already available to all Windows users, while Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) is designed to be usable by all Windows storefronts and games. These innovations, along with performance optimizations made to Windows and driver enhancements from partners like AMD, deliver a smoother, more powerful gaming experience—benefiting players no matter where they play with Windows. The future of handheld gaming is here—and it’s built on the freedom of Windows and powered by Xbox.\n\nOn behalf of Team Xbox, thank you for being with us as we embark on this new era of handheld gaming.\n\n![]()\n\n![]()",
