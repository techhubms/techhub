  "EnhancedContent": "Work is fundamentally a team sport, yet until now AI has largely been a personal assistant. Today, we’re introducing new collaboration-focused agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot users—**giving every team, project, meeting, and community an AI teammate**, adding context-aware AI to support the unique needs of every collaboration scenario.\n\nThese new collaborative agents are designed to enhance work across Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and Viva Engage, to help groups coordinate, communicate, and execute with greater clarity and efficiency. By leveraging work intelligence from Microsoft Graph, these agents deliver context-aware support while upholding enterprise-grade security, identity, compliance, and admin controls—helping interactions remain productive and protected. Read on to explore how these agents become active participants at every stage of teamwork.\n\n[Enhance teamwork with new collaborative agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot)\n\n## Enabling human-agent teams\n\nNew purpose-built agents provide always-on AI embedded where collaboration happens. Each agent is grounded in the context of the group and equipped with skills tailored to the unique ways that groups collaborate in channels, meetings, and communities in Teams, and libraries and sites in SharePoint. Let’s say, for example, a team is working on a product launch for “Project Pluto.”\n\nThe team consolidates all their conversations and plans into a dedicated “Project Pluto” channel in Teams, which is now equipped with a “Project Pluto Agent.” Users in the channel can direct this agent to summarize threads, distill decisions, draft plans and posts, schedule checkpoints, and coordinate with the Project Manager Agent to create tasks to keep work moving.\n\nWhen it’s time for a planning meeting in Teams to discuss “Project Pluto,” the [Facilitator agent](https://aka.ms/TeamsSeptember2025) for meetings steps in to prepare agendas. During the meeting, it proactively takes notes, keeps the discussion on track, captures decisions, and converts them into owned actions with follow-ups—fully tracked through integration with the [Project Manager Agent](https://aka.ms/9/18plannerblog)—and even completes some tasks on its own. Meeting participants can collectively guide the agent to do things like re-arrange the agenda or set a meeting timer.\n\nAnd to amplify the product launch across the “Sales Community” in Viva Engage, the “[Sales Community agent](http://aka.ms/CommunityAgent2025)” handles announcements, answers common questions with cited sources, and helps community managers keep discussions active and accurate in real-time.\n\nBehind the scenes, the [Knowledge Agent in SharePoint](http://aka.ms/KnowledgeAgent) keeps the “Project Pluto” workspace in shape. It organizes and enriches files, applies the right tags, tracks updates, and stitches together related content from the Teams channel, meetings, and the Sales Community. So, when anyone asks Microsoft 365 Copilot a question—whether it’s *“What’s our approved positioning?”* or *“Which spec is final?”*—it pulls the authoritative source with citations.\n\nTogether, these agents keep every stage of the “Project Pluto” launch—from planning to execution to communication—running smoothly, with AI working alongside the team. Teams also supports an open ecosystem of partner-built agents, and with Model Context Protocol (MCP), those agents can seamlessly collaborate with native Teams agents—sharing context and invoking each others’ tools within the same workflow. We’re excited to work with partners to develop solutions to make cross-platform collaboration with Teams effortless.\n\n## Reimagining teamwork with AI: Getting started\n\n[Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot) is moving beyond personal productivity to enable teams to work together with AI—building strategy, reducing miscommunication, and accelerating progress. These new collaborative agents are now available to all Microsoft 365 Copilot users in public preview, and Facilitator for Teams meetings is now generally available. Because these experiences are built on the same security, compliance, and privacy standards that underpin Microsoft 365, organizations can adopt them with confidence.\n\nTo get started, simply ask any of these agents for help wherever you’re working. Here are a few ways to collaborate with AI:\n\n- Use Facilitator for your next team meeting to generate an agenda, capture decisions, automatically assign follow-ups, and pressure-test the main points made during the meeting.\n- Ask the agent in one of your Teams channels to draft a status report from the past week, based on channel conversations, and any meetings it participated in.\n- Enable an agent in your busiest Viva Engage community, and compare the answers provided by your community’s agent with your response.\n- Ask the Knowledge Agent to tag and organize all relevant files for a project you’re working on, then create a project summary you can share with stakeholders.\n\n## Unlocking AI collaboration with Microsoft\n\nLearn more about [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot), and explore the resources below to learn more about the collaborative AI capabilities described above:\n\n- [AI and Microsoft Teams: A new era of collaboration](https://aka.ms/TeamsSeptember2025)\n- [Introducing Knowledge Agent in SharePoint](http://aka.ms/KnowledgeAgent)\n- [Introducing agents in Viva Engage communities: Your AI-powered community expert](https://aka.ms/CommunityAgent2025)\n- [Power up project management in Teams with the Project Manager Agent](https://aka.ms/9/18plannerblog)\n\n[Try Copilot Chat today](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat?fromcode=cmmyr718qsb&amp;refOrigin=Other&amp;auth=2)",
