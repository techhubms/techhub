Imagine this: two helicopters slicing through the Miami night sky, one carrying a 26-foot wide screen (200+ sq ft in size), the other with Team Ninja Community Manager, Emmanuel “Master” Rodriguez, and diamond-certified recording artist Swae Lee.\n\nThe result? A jaw-dropping, first-of-its-kind spectacle that fused gaming, technology, and pure adrenaline. The event also set a new Guinness World Records title for the largest video game display flown by helicopter.\n\nAs the city lights shimmered below, Yakumo of the Raven ninja clan leapt into the night, battling enemies across an enormous screen suspended in the sky. Every slash, every grapple, every heart-pounding moment of combat came alive against the backdrop of snippets of an exclusive new record from Swae Lee entitled ‘Flammable’.\n\nThe inspiration behind this stunt comes straight from *Ninja Gaiden 4*’s in-game lore. The denizens of Tokyo have escaped the toxic floodwaters by building skyward. The skyscraper district towers above the ruined city below, a breathtaking vertical landscape that mirrors the high-flying action we brought to life.\n\n![Ninja Gaiden 4 Helicopter Stunt Image](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/10/A-4b6c448a893c539b9425-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nTechnology played a starring role in making this dream a reality. Using advanced sports broadcasting tech, we streamed live gameplay from Emmanuel’s helicopter to the massive screen – built by pioneering aerial media company, Heli-D – in the other.\n\nTiming, precision, and nerves of steel were everything — a misstep would have grounded the Raven. But as Yakumo fought and triumphed across the illuminated sky, it was clear that the risk was worth it.\n\n![Ninja Gaiden 4 Helicopter Stunt Image - Master Rodriguez playing in helicopter](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/10/F-22c8334a203126b435a5-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nThis is more than a launch; it’s a celebration of everything *Ninja Gaiden 4* stands for — precision, skill, and pushing limits. From the game’s lore-rich skyscrapers to the Miami skyline we soared across, we’ve redefined what it means to experience a video game live.\n\nIn the dead of night, the ninja truly awakened — and for those lucky enough to witness it, the sky has never looked more alive.\n\n![Ninja Gaiden 4 Helicopter Stunt Image - World Record display](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/10/D-8bee1945eab37f9002b2-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n*Ninja Gaiden 4*arrives tomorrow, October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, Xbox Cloud, Xbox Play Anywhere – also available on Steam and PlayStation 5. Play it day one with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.\n\nThe Deluxe Edition includes future gameplay content “The Two Masters”, along with additional character skins, weapon skins, and in-game items. Pre-order either the Standard Edition or the Deluxe Edition to get the Dark Dragon Descendent Yakumo skin at launch.\n\n**More on Swae Lee**\n\nSwae Lee first saw mainstream recognition as the younger and melodic half of southern hip-hop duo Rae Sremmurd. Swae has made a name for himself outside of his duo work, showcasing himself as a force to be reckoned with both within and beyond the hip-hop world. Tracks such as French Montana’s diamond-certified ‘Unforgettable’ highlight his singing chops, while his impressive list of writing credits includes Beyoncé’s ‘Formation’.\n\nSwae’s melodic repertoire, however, is not relegated exclusively to the R&B and hip-hop sphere as his crooning can also take on ballad form and mesh into a more electronic background as well—a complex Gemini in many ways. His impact on the music industry is also underscored by his record-breaking achievements, including the historic success of the Grammy-nominated track, ‘Sunflower’, which became the first-ever song to be certified 2x Diamond by the RIAA and holds one of the biggest streaming records in history. In addition to ‘Sunflower’, Swae’s contributions to hits like Travis Scott’s ‘Sicko Mode’ have also earned diamond certifications, further cementing his place as a dominant force in modern music.\n\n[!\\[NINJA GAIDEN 4 Preorder Standard Edition\\](https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26007.14524843898704391.85a1bf00-ba10-44d9-90b4-d20f9cb73fb6.da3a1785-ad9e-463f-ae57-2ec1f5f94999?w=400&#038;h=600)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9NKDWGNFK77P)\n\n## NINJA GAIDEN 4 Preorder Standard Edition\n\nXbox Game Studios\n\n☆☆☆☆☆ 40\n\n★★★★★\n\n$69.99\n\n[Pre-order](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9NKDWGNFK77P)\n\nPre-order now to receive the Dark Dragon Descendant Yakumo Skin at launch\n\nThe definitive ninja hack & slash franchise returns with NINJA GAIDEN 4!
