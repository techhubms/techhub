This year’s annual feature update (version 25H2) will continue the recent Windows feature update trend of being delivered in an optimized way using servicing technology. So, let me share details on version 25H2, explain how to get it, and provide information for commercial and education customers.\n\n## **A streamlined, lean and security-focused update**\n\nWindows 11, version 25H2 will be delivered as an enablement package (eKB). This means that it contains all the recently announced features in Windows 11, version 24H2.1 Both versions use a shared code base and [servicing branch](https://aka.ms/WindowsUpdatesSharedServicing), streamlining the update. It also means that you’ll continue to see new features released to Windows via monthly updates as part of our continuous innovation model2.\n\nAs part of the Microsoft [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative?msockid=3854305482596e953ab325ba83c46fec) commitment, Windows continues iterating and improving its security features and posture to help protect customers from security threats in our software and services. Version 25H2 includes significant advancements in build and runtime vulnerability detection, coupled with AI assisted secure coding. We’ve designed version 25H2 to address and mitigate security threats in adherence to a robust security development lifecycle (SDL) policy and requirements.\n\nVersion 25H2 is also leaner due to removed legacy features such as PowerShell 2.0 and Windows Management Instrumentation command-line (WMIC).\n\n## **How to get it**\n\nWindows 11, version 25H2 will be delivered using servicing technology (like that used for the monthly update process), providing a fast and reliable installation experience. Availability begins today via a controlled feature rollout2 for eligible devices running Windows 11, version 24H2 for users who have already turned on the “[Get the latest updates as soon as they’re available](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-updates-as-soon-as-they-re-available-for-your-device-cad7b32b-001e-435b-9110-f18309b54168)” toggle. If we detect that your device may have an issue, such as an application or driver incompatibility, we may put a [safeguard hold](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5006965-how-to-check-information-about-safeguard-holds-affecting-your-device-265cf311-6c98-4413-956b-75b3044dfde9) in place and not offer the update until that issue is resolved. We will expand the rollout breadth over the next few months and share more information on the [Windows release health hub](https://aka.ms/WRH25H2). For more information on ways to get the update, [watch this video](https://aka.ms/video/W11/how-to-get-25H2).\n\n## **Information for commercial and education customers**\n\nVersion 25H2 is now available via Windows Autopatch and the Microsoft 365 admin center.3,4 We recommend that commercial organizations begin targeted deployments to validate that their apps, devices and infrastructure work as expected with the new release.\n\nNew Windows 11, version 25H2 commercial functionality includes [Wi-Fi 7 for enterprise connectivity](https://aka.ms/WiFi7forEnterprise). It also offers IT admins the ability to [remove select pre-installed Microsoft Store apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/configuration/policy-based-inbox-app-removal/policy-based-inbox-app-removal) via Microsoft Intune or Group Policy on Enterprise and Education devices. See how to [get ready for Windows 11, version 25H2](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/get-ready-for-windows-11-version-25h2/4426437).\n\nThis update continues the [annual Windows 11 feature update cadence](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/windows-lifecycle-and-servicing-update/ba-p/2493043), with new feature updates released in the second half of the calendar year. This [new version](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/whats-new/whats-new-windows-11-version-23h2) resets the 24 months of support for Home and Pro editions and 36 months of support for Enterprise and Education editions. Note that select features and enhancements initially [released disabled by default in version 24H2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/temporary-enterprise-feature-control) will be *enabled by default* in version 25H2. You can find more information on IT tools (including policies) to support version 25H2 in the [Windows IT Pro Blog](https://aka.ms/25H2-for-IT-pros).\n\n## **Staying protected and productive**\n\nAs always, I recommend that you update your devices to this latest version of Windows 11, which provides you with the latest features, security improvements and control. We will closely monitor the update and share timely information on the rollout status and any known issues (open and resolved) across both feature and monthly updates via the [Windows release health hub](https://aka.ms/WindowsReleaseHealth) and [@WindowsUpdate](https://twitter.com/WindowsUpdate). Please continue to tell us about your experience by providing comments or suggestions via Feedback Hub.\n\n*1Feature parity begins with the November 2025 security update.
