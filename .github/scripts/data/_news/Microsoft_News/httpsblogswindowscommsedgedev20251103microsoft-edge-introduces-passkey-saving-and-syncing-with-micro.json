This update makes signing in easier and safer. Here’s how it works and why passkeys are the smart choice for protecting your online accounts.\n\nNote that this feature is being gradually rolled out in Microsoft Edge 142 on Windows for Microsoft Accounts (MSA) and will be available in additional platforms subsequently.\n\n## What are passkeys?\n\nPasskeys are a simpler and more secure way to sign in to your apps and websites **without needing a password**. Instead of typing a password, you authenticate using your device’s built-in security, like a fingerprint, facial recognition, or a PIN.\n\nPasskeys are built on the Fast IDentity Online 2 (FIDO2) open standard, which uses public-key cryptography to securely sign you in. Your account stores a unique private key safely specific to a website, while the website only keeps a public key. This means that even if a website suffers a data breach, **your account stays safe**.\n\n[!\\[\\](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/themes/microsoft-stories-theme/img/theme/shims/16x9.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je-CtqdQNLc)\n\n## Why should I use passkeys?\n\nPasskeys are becoming the future of online security.\n\n**Stronger security:**\n\n- Passkeys can’t be guessed or reused like passwords.\n- They’re resistant to phishing and credential stuffing attacks.\n\n**Faster and simpler way to sign in:**\n\n- No need to remember complex passwords or type them manually.\n- Just use your fingerprint, face scan, or device PIN to sign in.\n\n**Seamless across devices:**\n\n- Passkeys sync securely via your Microsoft account and are currently available on Windows devices – with planned future availability on additional platforms.\n\n**Privacy-first by design:**\n\n- Your biometric data is processed locally on your device.\n- Websites only get a cryptographic proof that you are you.\n\n## How can I use passkeys in Microsoft Edge?\n\nYou can store passkeys in Microsoft Password Manager in Edge. This is currently supported on Windows, with planned future availability on additional platforms.\n\nPasskeys are stored in your Microsoft account and protected by a Microsoft Password Manager PIN, which you’ll setup while creating passkey for the very first time.\n\nWhen you visit a site which supports passkeys, you’ll be asked if you’d like to create a passkey in Microsoft Password Manager. The created passkey gets saved in Microsoft Password Manager and can be used to login to the specific website by simply performing your preferred way of device authentication such as fingerprint, facial recognition, or PIN code.\n\nWhile syncing passkeys on subsequent devices, you’ll be asked to verify yourself by providing the Microsoft Password Manager PIN that you created before to unlock your passkeys on the new device.\n\n## Ready to try passkeys?\n\nWhenever you see the **Create a passkey** prompt, give it a try! It’s the easiest way to make your online life **simpler and more secure**.\n\n**Pre-requisites**:\n\n- Windows device (version 10 and above)\n- Microsoft Edge (version 142 and above)\n- Microsoft account\n\n**How are my passkeys securely stored in Microsoft Password Manager?**\n\nThe created passkeys are stored securely in the cloud in an encrypted format and are additionally protected by a Microsoft Password Manager PIN. For unlocking passkeys on a new device, you will have a maximum of 10 attempts to input the correct PIN.\n\nIf you forget your Microsoft Password Manager PIN, you can reset it from a device that already has passkey access by navigating to **Edge Settings** > **Passwords and autofill** > **Microsoft Password Manager** > **Settings**.\n\nAll the unlocking and reset attempts of Microsoft Password Manager PIN are logged and integrity protected in the immutable [Azure confidential ledger](https://aka.ms/acl-docs) for added transparency.\n\n**Can I use passkeys created on Microsoft Password Manager on other apps?**\n\nWith the Microsoft Password Manager plugin on Windows, you can use your passkeys outside of Edge, such as in other browsers and applications on Windows. This capability is coming soon on Windows.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat happens to my saved passwords? Your saved passwords remain untouched. You can continue using them as usual. But whenever a site supports passkeys, you’ll have the option to upgrade to a passkey for stronger security and faster logins. Do I need to create new accounts to use passkeys? No. For most existing accounts, you can simply add a passkey without changing anything else. What if I switch devices? Your passkeys are securely backed up and synced through your Microsoft account. When you sign in to a new device, your passkeys come with you.\n\nNote: This requires verifying yourself with the Microsoft Password Manager PIN on the new device. Passkey sync capability is available on Windows and will be expanded to other platforms soon. Is syncing passkeys available on mobile or for work or school accounts (Microsoft Entra)? No, this functionality is currently not available for mobile devices or for Microsoft Entra accounts. Are passkeys safe if someone steals my device? Yes, passkeys are designed to be secure even if your device is lost or stolen. Without your fingerprint, facial recoginition, or device PIN, no one can use them. Can I still view or manage my saved passwords? Absolutely. You can manage both your existing passwords and passkeys from your Microsoft Password Manager in Edge. Where can I learn more?
