At the heart of that vision is trust, and delivering a safe, secure, and relevant search experience is a critical part of that vision.\n\nAt Copilot Sessions, we reaffirmed our commitment to a human-centered AI strategy focused on making technology work in service of people, not the other way around. At the heart of that vision is trust, and delivering a safe, secure, and relevant search experience is a critical part of that vision.\n\nThat’s why we’re bringing the best of AI search to Copilot, combining intelligent answers with trusted sources: **Starting with the Fall Release, Copilot responses will now include more prominent, clickable citations and the option to see aggregated sources. We’re also excited to launch a dedicated search experience within Copilot for even greater depth, breadth, and precision.**\n\n[Try searching in Copilot today](http://copilot.microsoft.com/?chat-mode=cs).\n\n## **Trust and freedom**\n\n“Searching” has always reflected a deeply human instinct—the drive to satisfy curiosity and the need to trust in what we find. In the era of AI, it is no different; when you ask Copilot a question—whether it’s a quick fact or a complex query—you expect clarity, confidence, and control.\n\nOur journey began with [Copilot Search.](https://blogs.bing.com/search/April-2025/Introducing-Copilot-Search-in-Bing)  First introduced inside of Bing, it blends the best of traditional and generative search together to help find what you need. Over the past few months, we’ve learned a lot: how people explore, what they value most, and how much trust in sources matters. That shaped our next step: Now, Copilot’s responses will have more prominent citations to show you the publisher content that it was sourced from.\n\nWe’ve optimized Bing’s powerful search capabilities and utilized Copilot’s intelligence to deliver greater control and transparency to everyday interactions with your AI companion. Now, when Copilot provides an answer, it doesn’t just deliver a summary—it shows you exactly where the information comes from, with relevant, clear, and clickable sources.\n\nFor example, if you’re planning an unforgettable vacation to Rome, a query like “Best neighborhoods to stay in Rome for first-time visitors” goes from hours of searching the web to a quick summary of suggestions and cited sources so you can dive deeper. Knowing where information comes from matters—a trusted recommendation can make your trip memorable, while an unknown source might not meet your expectations. Citations to publisher sources integrated directly into Copilot responses let you move beyond summaries; just click to view the source directly, whenever you choose. That’s the beauty of the ability to see sources with an answer; it feels more natural, human, and ultimately satisfying—knowing you have all the information you need in one place.\n\nBut this isn’t just about trust—it’s also about freedom to explore. That’s why we’re also bringing a consolidated list of the sources used to generate Copilot’s response into one place; simply click “Show all” to see the full list of references, including related results, in the right pane. Now, you have a curated response side-by-side with the sources themselves so you can find the information you’re looking for.\n\n![An internet tab window shows interactions with Copilot, outlining the best places to visit in Rome.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image.webp)\n\n## **Search smarter**\n\nThese enhancements to the Copilot experience are just the start. For those moments when you know that you need search, we’re introducing a dedicated experience directly within Copilot. Just click the drop-down and select “Search” to get intelligently curated answers and even richer references and citations. Responses are adaptive, delivering concise answers for simple queries or in-depth summaries for analytical, or more complex queries.\n\n![A mobile screen shows a user typing to ask Copilot to recommend the best burrito in all of Los Angeles.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Search-mode-with-prompt.webp)\n\nTo make discovery smooth and effortless, we’re introducing dedicated navigation links at the top of responses. For example, simple queries such as “amazon” or “TripAdvisor NYC” will give you a simple link where a single click takes you exactly where you need to go—just like the familiar experience of how search has worked for years. Soon, complex queries such as “I lost my passport, what is the official passport application site?” will generate a response linking to the exact site you need to go to. Search is the best of both worlds—speed and depth—designed to keep you in control.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Response-stream-472x1024.webp)\n\n## **A healthy ecosystem**\n\nWe’ve designed these changes to Copilot and the new Search experience within Copilot with publishers and content owners in mind to support a healthy web ecosystem. Cited sources are easily accessible in-line, highlighted prominently at the bottom of the response, and all references are available in the right pane. This allows you to be just a click away from the publisher and content owner sources that were used.\n\n## **Get started**\n\nWith these updates, we’ve taken what people love about Search and paired it with the intelligence of Copilot. The result? A seamless experience that feels natural and trustworthy. This is designed to serve people: fast when you need speed, deep when you need detail, and always grounded in the best of the web. Because technology should empower your curiosity—not limit it.\n\nThese updates are available today in Copilot on copilot.com, iOS and Android mobile apps, and Copilot in Edge. In the new Copilot Mode in Edge, simply press tab in the address bar to get quick access to Search in Copilot.\n\n[Try searching in Copilot today](http://copilot.microsoft.com/?chat-mode=cs).",
