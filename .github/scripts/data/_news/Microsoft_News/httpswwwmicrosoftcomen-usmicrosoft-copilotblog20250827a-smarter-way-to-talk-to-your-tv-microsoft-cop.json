Now you can quickly find what you’re looking for and discover new favorites right from your living room.\n\nBecause it lives on the biggest screen in the home, Copilot is a social experience—something you can use together with family and friends to spark conversations, help groups decide what to watch, and turn the TV into a shared space for curiosity and connection.\n\n“Copilot on Samsung TVs and monitors brings AI out of your pocket and into the heart of your home,” said David Washington, Partner General Manager, Microsoft AI. “It’s there when you and your family want to discover something to watch together, get answers to your questions, plan your weekend, or simply hang out.”\n\n## Built on partnership\n\nMicrosoft and Samsung have a long history of bringing the best of technology together, from Windows and Office on Galaxy devices to Xbox Cloud Gaming on Samsung TVs. This collaboration brings that same spirit of innovation to Copilot, making your TV smarter, more personal, and more fun.\n\n### For recaps, rabbit holes, and everything in-between\n\nCopilot shines when it comes to finding your next favorite thing to watch, but it’s also there for the little questions, big plans, and everyday moments in between.\n\n- **Custom, spoiler-free recaps:** “I want to get back into *The Crown,* I left off at Season 3, Episode 4. What happened up until then?”\n\n- **Ultra-specific recommendations:** “Like *The Queen’s Gambit*, but about cooking instead of chess, and under two hours.”\n\n- **Group-friendly picks**: “Hannah likes rom-coms, David likes sci-fi, Mark likes thrillers. What’s something we’ll all like?” Perfect for when everyone’s gathered in the living room and you want to decide together.\n\n- **Post-watch deep dives:** “Who was the voice actor for that character?” or “What else has the director done?”\n\n- **Everyday help:** “Will Saturday in Seattle be good conditions for hiking?” or “Cheer me up after a breakup.”\n\n## A more visual, more personal experience\n\nCopilot’s **appearance** is a friendly, animated presence on your TV that reacts and lip-syncs as it speaks, with expressions that match the tone of the conversation. It’s a visible reminder that your companion is listening, thinking, and responding just for you.\n\nAnd when Copilot answers, it doesn’t just tell you; it **shows** you. Movies, weather, and image results appear as rich, glanceable cards designed for the big screen, complete with ratings, photos, and key details.\n\n**How it works**\n\n1. **Activate Copilot:** Copilot will roll out automatically on select Samsung TVs. Users can see Copilot (on the Apps Tab) at the Samsung Tizen OS home Samsung Daily+. Press the mic button on your Samsung remote and speak naturally.\n\n1. **(Optional) Sign in for a personal touch:** Use a quick QR code to connect your Microsoft account and unlock Copilot’s personalization, memory, and preferences for you.\n\n1. **Ask for what you want:** Whether it’s a title, a question, or advice, Copilot understands.\n\n1. **See and hear your answer:** Watch Copilot respond with a mix of visuals and voice.\n\n![A screen shot of a movie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-13.webp)\n\n**Availability** Copilot launches in the 2025 lineup of Samsung Smart TVs and Smart Monitors [1] and is now available, with more model years and features to follow. The experience is available at no cost.\n\n[1] Copilot is available on 2025 TV models including Micro RGB, Neo QLED, OLED, The Frame Pro, The Frame, as well as the M7, M8, and M9 Smart Monitors. Copilot is available in select markets. Availability will expand to additional regions and models over time and experience may vary by market.",
