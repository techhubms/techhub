And that’s why we’re scaling our GPU fleet faster than anyone else.\n\nJust last year, we added over 2 gigawatts of new capacity – roughly the output of 2 nuclear power plants.\n\nAnd today we’re going further, announcing the world's most powerful AI datacenter, located in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nFairwater is a seamless cluster of hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GB200s, connected by enough fiber to circle the Earth 4.5 times.\n\nIt will deliver 10x the performance of the world’s fastest supercomputer today, enabling AI training and inference workloads at a level never before seen.\n\nFor AI training workloads, you need compute at exponential scale. That’s why we designed the datacenter, GPU fleet, and network together as one integrated system. This ensures a single job can run from day 1 at exponential scale across thousands of GPUs.\n\nFairwater uses a liquid-cooled closed-loop system for cooling GPUs that requires zero water for operations after construction.\n\nAnd we’re matching all of the energy that is consumed with renewable sources.\n\nAnd of course, it is just one of several similar sites we’re lighting up across our 70+ regions. We have multiple identical Fairwater datacenters under construction in other locations across the US, in addition to our AI infrastructure already deployed in over 100 datacenters around the world, powering model training, test-time compute, RL tuning, and real-time inference at global scale.\n\nToo often during times like this, people go with the current and only later wonder, how did we get here?\n\nWith Fairwater, we're charting a new path: doing the hard engineering work, bringing compute, network, and storage into one highly scaled cluster, and designing closed-loop energy systems to meet real-world computing needs.\n\nAnd partnering with local communities to ensure it's thoughtfully done in a way that is sustainable, creates new jobs, and expands opportunity.\n\nWe are thrilled to see this take hold in Wisconsin, and we are just getting started.\n\nLearn more about Fairwater here: [https://lnkd.in/gpdni9gt](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fgpdni9gt&amp;urlhash=0gzr&amp;trk=public_post-text)\n\n``\n\n``\n\n[!\\[\\]() !\\[\\]() !\\[\\]() 6,161](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n``\n\n``\n\n``\n\n``\n\n``\n\n``\n\n``\n\n[309 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_like-cta)\n\n[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n``\n\n``\n\n- - - -\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jihad-husain?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Jihad Husain](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jihad-husain?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nLeading Innovation in Global Tourism | Managing Director @ Gateway Malabar Holidays | Founder & MD @ Medisafar | Visionary Leader in Indian & Global Tourism | Travel Industry Leader\n\n4d\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nSuch impressive scale, and a thoughtful approach to sustainability.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [2 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n3 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://de.linkedin.com/in/kcsjmkadaner?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Jean-Michel Kadaner](https://de.linkedin.com/in/kcsjmkadaner?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nPartner & SME at AREKA CONSULTING\n\n4d\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_if-intelligence-is-the-log-of-compute-it-activity-7374444167059468288-wxxV&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nFab for the cooling approaches (in various locations),but what about power sources ?

Azure was the first cloud provider to bring online the NVIDIA GB200 server, rack and full datacenter clusters. Each rack packs 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, tied together in a single NVLink domain that delivers 1.8 terabytes of GPU-to-GPU bandwidth and gives every GPU access to 14 terabytes of pooled memory. Rather than behaving like dozens of separate chips, the rack operates as a single, giant accelerator, capable of processing an astonishing 865,000 tokens per second, the highest throughput of any cloud platform available today. The Norway and UK AI datacenters will use similar clusters, and take advantage of NVIDIAs next AI chip design (GB300) which offers even more pooled memory per rack.\n\nCooling: By designing purpose-built AI datacenters, we were able to build liquid cooling infrastructure into the facility directly to get us more rack-density in the datacenter. Fairwater is supported by the second largest water-cooled chiller plant on the planet and will continuously circulate water in its closed loop cooling system. The hot water is then piped out to the cooling “fins” on each side of the datacenter, where 172 20-foot fans chill and recirculate the water back to the datacenter. This system keeps the AI datacenter running efficiently, even at peak loads.\n\nStorage: Modern datacenters can contain exabytes of storage and millions of CPU compute scores. To support the AI infrastructure cluster, an entirely separate datacenter infrastructure is needed to store and process the data used and generated by the AI cluster. To give you an example of the scale — the Wisconsin AI datacenter’s storage systems are five football fields in length!\n\n[#Silicon](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fsilicon&amp;trk=public_post-text) [#Server](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fserver&amp;trk=public_post-text) [#Rack](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frack&amp;trk=public_post-text) [#Storage](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fstorage&amp;trk=public_post-text) [#Facility](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Ffacility&amp;trk=public_post-text)\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_reshare_feed-actor-image)\n\n[Satya Nadella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_reshare_feed-actor-name)\n\nSatya Nadella is an Influencer\n\nChairman and CEO at Microsoft\n\n5d\n\nIf intelligence is the log of compute… it starts with a lot of compute!

We have multiple identical Fairwater datacenters under construction in other locations across the US, in addition to our AI infrastructure already deployed in over 100 datacenters around the world, powering model training, test-time compute, RL tuning, and real-time inference at global scale.\n\nToo often during times like this, people go with the current and only later wonder, how did we get here?\n\nWith Fairwater, we're charting a new path: doing the hard engineering work, bringing compute, network, and storage into one highly scaled cluster, and designing closed-loop energy systems to meet real-world computing needs.\n\nAnd partnering with local communities to ensure it's thoughtfully done in a way that is sustainable, creates new jobs, and expands opportunity.\n\nWe are thrilled to see this take hold in Wisconsin, and we are just getting started.\n\nLearn more about Fairwater here: [https://lnkd.in/gpdni9gt](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2Fgpdni9gt&amp;urlhash=0gzr&amp;trk=public_post_reshare-text)\n\n``\n\n``\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictoria-hughes-275a56103_mind-blowing-scale-fairwater-sets-a-new-activity-7374542965748391936-uoON&amp;trk=public_post_like-cta)\n\n[Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictoria-hughes-275a56103_mind-blowing-scale-fairwater-sets-a-new-activity-7374542965748391936-uoON&amp;trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n``\n\n``\n\n- - - -\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictoria-hughes-275a56103_mind-blowing-scale-fairwater-sets-a-new-activity-7374542965748391936-uoON&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n``\n- https://www.linkedin.com/posts/how-ai-datacenters-eat-the-world-activity-7368337016763088896-a19s\n- https://www.linkedin.com/posts/data-canopy_quantum-computing-just-reached-its-inflection-activity-7368266855859355648-z3mI\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-canopy?trk=public_post_feed-actor-image)\n\n[Data Canopy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/data-canopy?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n1,431 followers\n\n3w\n\n- [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdata-canopy_quantum-computing-just-reached-its-inflection-activity-7368266855859355648-z3mI&amp;trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=POST&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nQuantum computing just reached its inflection point. When Nvidia's CEO suddenly changes his stance on quantum timeline, markets move. But beneath the stock surges lies a deeper shift. The quantum revolution isn't about qubits alone. It's about infrastructure. Classical data centers can't handle quantum-classical hybrid systems. They weren't built for this reality. Power density requirements exceed traditional specs. Environmental controls need unprecedented precision.Latency tolerances shrink to near zero. The future demands quantum-ready infrastructure. This transforms how we build, how we scale, how we grow.
