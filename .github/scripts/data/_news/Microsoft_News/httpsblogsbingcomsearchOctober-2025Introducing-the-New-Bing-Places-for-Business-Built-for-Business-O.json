Bing Places for Business is a free online platform where businesses can create and manage their listings to appear in Bing search results and Bing Maps, making them more visible to potential customers.\n\n**Listening First: What Business Owners Told Us**\n\nBefore we wrote a single line of code, we spent months listening to business owners about their challenges and goals. Our research revealed a few consistent themes:\n\n- We need to make Bing Places for Business more discoverable to help business owners to claim their business in Bing\n- The portal needs to be **simplified** and built with the same **design** principles as the rest of our products**.**\n- **Importing** should be **seamless.** Business owners wanted to seamlessly import all their businesses to Bing without spending a lot of time by claiming or adding their business manually.\n\nWe took these insights to heart and rebuilt the experience from the ground up.\n\n**A Unified Experience Under Bing.com**\n\nOne of the most significant changes is the migration of the entire business ownerâ€™s experience into the Bing.com domain. This move simplifies access, improves trust, and aligns Bing Places with the broader Bing ecosystem. Whether you're claiming a listing, updating business hours, or uploading photos, everything now lives in one cohesive space.\n\nAs part of this transition, the domain will change from **www.bingplaces.com** to **www.bing.com/forbusiness**, making it easier for business owners to find and manage their listings directly within the Bing experience.\n\nThe new experience is now liveÂ and will continue adding further features in the following months to ensure a complete and polished rollout. Our current users and their business listings will be automatically migrated to the new account and current users will be redirected to this brand-new experience when they login with their Bing Places for Business credentials.\n\n![New bing places for business homepage](/getmedia/c1c73881-5455-4ffe-a093-f0d205a8e1bd/New-Homepage-Preview.jpg)\n\n**Smarter Imports, Smoother Management**\n\nWeâ€™ve made major improvements to how business owners import listings from Google. The new import flow is faster, more reliable, and better at preserving key attributes like business name, hours, and contact details. Once imported, managing listings is easier than everâ€”with intuitive dashboards, bulk editing tools, and real-time status updates.\n\n![options to setup your profile in bing places for business](/getmedia/3fd14daa-20b0-4113-a311-fa9a8ea5a6a4/Set-Up-Your-Profile.jpg)\n\n**Introducing the Recommendation Tool**\n\nLaunching alongside the new experience is our **Recommendation Tool**, designed to help new business owners enrich their listings with high-impact information that can help drive more engagement with your listing. Using listing health signals and the segment of the business, the tool suggests business owners:\n\n- Add Photos that attract attention\n- Add key missing Business details that drive engagement like website link, hours of operations, social media links\n- Segment specific suggestions like adding a menu link or online order link for restaurants\n\n![new bing places for business recommendations](/getmedia/3adb8aee-b06e-4486-a23b-9e9f46aed4b8/Recommendations.jpg)\n\nThis feature is especially helpful for owners who are new to local SEO and want to stand out in Bing search results.\n\n**Whatâ€™s Next**\n\nThis launch is just the beginning. We are continuing to invest in features that make Bing Places for Business more powerful and accessibleâ€”from deeper integrations with Bing Maps and Copilot to expanded support for agencies and other partners.\n\nWe invite all business owners to explore the new Bing Places for Business and see how easy it is to claim, manage, and grow your presence on Bing.\n\nðŸ‘‰ [https://www.bing.com/forbusiness](https://www.bing.com/forbusiness)\n\nPlease use our [support channels](https://www.bing.com/forbusiness/contactSupport) to share your feedback.
