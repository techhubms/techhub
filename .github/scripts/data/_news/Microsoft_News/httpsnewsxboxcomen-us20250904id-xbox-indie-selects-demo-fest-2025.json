From September 9-30, players on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One can dive into more than 40 demos, including upcoming titles and games with new content.\n\nWhether you’re eager to try something new or get a sneak peek at games coming in future, this demo event is one you won’t want to miss!\n\n**Here are a few things to keep in mind**:\n\n- While some may return to the Demo channel later, most of these demos will only be available to play this month, so don’t delay – if you see something you like the sound of, try it now!\n\n- These game demos differ from the usual ones in our Demo channel, as they’re shared before the games are finished and may not reflect the final product. Think of them more like “showfloor demos,” giving you early access and a chance to provide feedback. Expect these games to develop and improve before release.\n\n- Speaking of feedback – please share your thoughts with the developers via social media, or their websites! You could help shape the future of these games.\n\nWe’ll announce the full list of demos on September 9, but here are some games you can expect to see:\n\n## **Echo Weaver – Moonlight Kids/Akupara Games**\n\n![Echo Weaver Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/KEYART_1920x1080_v1-echo-weaver-905b0d0877e7229781da-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nCan you master time itself? *Echo Weaver* is a “metroidBRAINia” where time is your best resource and secrets are your only upgrades. You’re the last of the Weavers, a remnant of a ruined society trapped in a glitching time loop. The Congregation set out to explore the stars and find paradise. What they found instead has led their utopian project to ash and cinders – can you break the loop?\n\n## **Mina The Hollower** **** **– Yacht Club Games**\n\n![Mina the Hollower Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/titledHeroArt-mina-the-hollower-aff0bd5f8ba6de61f5c6-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nDescend into a frightful world of action-adventure in *Mina the Hollower*. Take control of Mina, a renowned Hollower hurled into a desperate mission to rescue a cursed island. Burrow beneath hazards and monsters, whip foes into oblivion, and gear up with an arsenal of sidearms and trinkets.\n\nExplore a vast world filled with pixel-perfect graphics, masterful gameplay, beastly bosses, and infectious music. Encounter a cast of bizarre characters, search out secrets in an array of exotic locales, and illuminate the omnipresent darkness in *Mina the Hollower*, a brand-new game from the developers who brought you Shovel Knight!\n\n## **The Jackbox Party Pack 11** **** **– Jackbox Games**\n\n![Jackbox 11 Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/XB_IDEvents-JBPP11-000cea19312646d4c778-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nThe Party Pack is back! *The Jackbox Party Pack 11* catapults you and your crew into the best timeline of party game pandemonium. Whether you’re a trivia titan, a joke mastermind, or the resident undercover detective of your friend group, there’s something for everyone in this pack. No extra controllers needed – players simply join the game and play using phones, tablets or computers!\n\nFive brand-new games will change the way you party this holiday season and beyond. Play two of these games in our demo:\n\n- **Doominate** (Writing): Take a perfectly lovely situation and destroy it in this head-to-head joke game where it feels so good to be so bad.

Hear Say supports 2-8 players.\n\n## **Yooka-Replaylee – Playtonic Games/PM Studios**\n\n![Yooka Replaylee Key Art](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/KeyArt_With-Logo-yooka-replaylee-f814fbf283b1ee521749-1900x1080.jpg)\n\n*Yooka-Replaylee* is the definitive remade and enhanced version of the 3D indie platforming collectathon darling, *Yooka-Laylee*, developed by key creative talent behind the Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country games.\n\nNew, remixed challenges and old favorites await as you embark to explore the huge, beautiful open worlds as the lovable buddy-duo Yooka (the green one) and Laylee (the purple one) once more, all while backed by a beautiful orchestral soundtrack. Did we mention there is a map now? A shiny new currency? And tons of customization options? It’s never moved, looked, or sounded better!\n\nAnd there’s so much more in store.
