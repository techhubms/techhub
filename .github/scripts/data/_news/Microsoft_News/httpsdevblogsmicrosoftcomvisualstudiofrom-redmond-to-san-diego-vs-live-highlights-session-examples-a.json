  "EnhancedContent": "There’s something special about hosting developers at Microsoft HQ — and this year’s Visual Studio Live! Redmond reminded me why I love these events. The energy in every room was electric. From the moment the first session kicked off, developers leaned in, asked smart, challenging questions, and took every opportunity to connect with the Product Managers and engineers from Visual Studio, Azure, and GitHub Copilot.\n\nBetween sessions, the hallways were buzzing. Right after the Experts Meet & Greet, one speaker shared a story that stuck with me:\n\n>\n> **“A customer came up to me and said: All those paper cuts that Mads showed that are being fixed with vNext are nothing compared to the complete gamechanger that Copilot is for developing. I’m going back and begging for it at my company.”**\n>\n\nMoments like that are exactly why these in-person events matter — they spark conversations that turn into real momentum back at the office.\n\n## Watch the Microsoft Sessions On-Demand\n\nIf you couldn’t make it to Redmond (or just want to revisit your favorites), we’ve made the Microsoft-led sessions available on YouTube. You’ll find keynotes, deep dives, and practical demos from the teams behind Visual Studio, Azure, and GitHub Copilot. Please note, the first 10 videos are available today and more will be added in the coming days, so keep checking back for new content or turn on YouTube notifications.\n\n🎥 Watch the playlist here — your front-row seat to Redmond’s best moments.\n\n[VIEW THE FULL PLAYLIST](https://aka.ms/vslivehq25)\n\n## Session Highlights – Just a Few Examples from a Packed Agenda\n\nWith more than 70 sessions led by 39 incredible Microsoft speakers, the week was filled with valuable insights, hands-on learning, and memorable moments.
