A new Microsoft Limited Edition Crocs Bundle will feature design elements inspired by some of the brand’s most recognizable moments, including Windows XP.\n\n“As part of Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebration, we’re releasing a Microsoft Limited Edition Crocs Bundle that includes nostalgic nods like Windows XP-inspired Crocs, custom Jibbitz™ charms, and a Bliss-themed drawstring backpack,” said Frank Shaw, chief communications officer at Microsoft.\n\nThe Bliss backdrop, a photograph of a green hill and blue sky with white clouds taken in Sonoma County, California, became a cultural icon for millions of Windows XP users in the early 2000s. Now it returns in a new form, reimagined as part of this limited-edition release.\n\nStarting today, the #MicrosoftCrocSweepstakes is open on Microsoft’s [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPRcPVijRHK/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==) through Tuesday, Oct. 7, at 11:59 p.m. PT. Please visit Microsoft’s Instagram for instructions on how to enter and be sure to review the [terms and conditions](https://aka.ms/50thSweepstakes).\n\nThis launch is part of a broader set of moments marking Microsoft’s 50th anniversary, bringing together culture, creativity and community in ways that honor the past while looking toward the future.",
