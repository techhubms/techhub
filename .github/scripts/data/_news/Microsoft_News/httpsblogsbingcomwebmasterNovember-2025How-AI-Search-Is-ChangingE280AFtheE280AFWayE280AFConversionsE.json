  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content\n\n*AI has sparked a revolution that is transforming everything from how products are made and marketed to how people discover and choose what to buy*.\n\nInstead of scrolling through lists of blue links, people now explore through conversations, ask follow-up questions, and build confidence long before they reach a website. This new path to conversion means brands and content owners must stop chasing clicks and focus on the signals that truly drive outcomes.\n\n**But how do we know which conversion signals are most important?**\n\nWhile the specific goals of every business or publisher differ, AI search is making one thing clear: the most valuable signals are the ones connected to visibility. By tracking impressions, placement in AI answers, and citations, brands can see where content is being surfaced, trusted, and considered, even before a visit occurs. More importantly, these signals reveal where interest is forming and where optimization can create lift, helping teams double down on what works to improve visibility in the moments when decisions are being shaped.\n\nIt's not that people are no longer clicking. They’re just clicking at later stages in the journey, and with far stronger intent. In fact, current industry research shows that visits from AI-search environments are not just matching but often exceeding traditional conversion rates, reinforcing a simple truth: quality matters more than volume. The priority now is to understand user actions and guide people toward high-value outcomes, whether that is a subscription, an inquiry, a demo request, a purchase, or other meaningful engagement.\n\nThis shift applies not only to commercial sites but also to news and information publishers, where visiblity in AI answers can shape deeper forms of engagement such as read-depth, recirculation, or return visits rather than immediate clicks.\n\n*The objective for publishers is to align with user intent and deliver clarity, credibility, and value at every stage of discovery, so that when someone is ready to act, your brand or content becomes the natural choice*.\n\n**How the Path to Conversion has Changed**\n\nBefore AI search, a typical customer might start with a broad query like “**best dishwashers for small spaces**,” then scroll through pages of blue links, piecing together details from reviews, spec sheets, and reseller sites. It was a manual, time-consuming process.\n\nToday, AI-powered search experiences understand [intent](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/November-2024/The-Value-of-Intent) and surface richer, more relevant results instantly.  Instead of sending users through multiple clicks and sources, the system embeds high-quality content within answers, summaries, and citations, highlighting key details like energy efficiency, noise level, and smart home compatibility. This creates clarity faster and builds confidence earlier in the journey, leading to stronger engagement with less friction.\n\nIn the dishwasher example, the customer quickly realizes that a quiet, energy-efficient model with smart features best suits their open-concept kitchen. They refine their query and AI search responds with a more detailed summary drawn from brand sites, reviews, and resellers, surfacing purchase options and rebates alongside recommendations with more relevant links.\n\nIn fewer steps than ever, the customer reaches a confident decision, guided by intent-aligned, multi-source content that reflects brand and third-party perspectives. This behavior shift, where discovery, research, and decision happen continuously within one environment, is redefining how site owners understand conversion.\n\n**With journeys becoming shorter and more connected, content clarity is critical. When information is not easily interpreted by LLMs, key details may be missed, reducing opportunities to appear in influential moments.**\n\nAs these shifts play out, the signals generated inside AI experiences become even more valuable, helping content teams see what resonates and where improvements can strengthen visibility.\n\n![Dishwasher_Conversion.jpg](/getattachment/40d3d553-34ee-410b-935b-3e31e6c1bd14/Dishwasher_Conversion.jpg \"Dishwasher_Conversion.jpg\")\n\n**How AI Search Understands and Responds to Evolving Intent**\n\n*AI systems refine their understanding of user intent across each follow-up question, chat turn, and contextual signal, including proactive moments where the system surfaces relevant content based on context or inferred needs.*\n\nAccording to Microsoft internal research, data from Microsoft Copilot sessions show a 22% increase in unique chat turns per session1, reflecting that search has evolved into an ongoing conversation rather than a single query. Each follow-up clarifies intent and brings the user closer to conversion, whether that means clicking a product link, making a purchase, or taking another high-value action.\n\nMicrosoft Advertising reports that Copilot-assisted customer journeys are 33% shorter on average than traditional search, and high intent conversion rates (users showing clear readiness to act) are 76% higher for AI-powered experiences compared to traditional search surfaces2.\n\nFor marketers, publishers, and SEOs, this means moving beyond traditional metrics to track new engagement signals that reflect influence, trust, and readiness to convert.\n\nAI-powered search builds on retrieval to generate contextual, conversational answers. Structured content, like [schema-marked](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/May-2025/IndexNow-Enables-Faster-and-More-Reliable-Updates-for-Shopping-and-Ads) product pages, FAQs, and comparison tables, helps AI systems interpret and summarize your content more effectively. This increases the chances of your being cited, clicked, and engaged with in multi-source answers.\n\n![Ruler_Edit.png](/getattachment/8bc7650f-1878-4f8d-b773-aeb715db1fde/Ruler_Edit.png \"Ruler_Edit.png\")\n\n**The New Conversion Journey in AI Search**\n\n*As AI-powered search reshapes how people explore information, more of the journey now happens inside the experience itself.*\n\nAcross the industry, AI-powered search is changing how users interact with search results. Users now spend more of the journey inside AI experiences, shaping visibility and engagement in new ways. As a result, engagement is shifting upstream (pre-click) within summaries, comparisons, and conversational refinements, rather than through multiple outbound clicks.\n\nZero-click visibility is one clear example of this change. When structured content such as FAQs, product specs, or schema-marked reviews appear in AI summaries or side-by-side comparisons, it can help shape brand awareness and preference before a user ever clicks through. A well-structured product page might have its key features surfaced in an AI-generated summary, while a retailer’s support content could appear in an answer box explaining setup or compatibility.\n\nBut zero-click outcomes are only part of the picture. In AI search, users also refine and narrow intent within a single session, asking follow-up questions, comparing brands, or filtering by features like “quietest dishwasher with smart home integration.” Each interaction creates engagement that moves the user closer to purchase, subscription, signup, or other meaningful action, even if the final action happens later or on another device.\n\nThe strategic challenge is that many of these signals, including visibility in summaries, cited content, or follow-up query engagement, are not captured in traditional analytics as it exists today. Yet they strongly influence trust, familiarity, and downstream conversions (on-site actions).\n\n***For marketers, visibility itself is becoming a form of currency. If your content is surfaced in summaries or comparisons, you’re shaping preference before a click ever happens.***\n\n![PersonSearchingOnPhone.png](/getattachment/067e9a4f-9667-47b6-90eb-f1d526114d86/PersonSearchingOnPhone.png \"PersonSearchingOnPhone.png\")\n\n**Does AI Search Traffic Convert?**\n\nThe latest research from multiple independent sources points to the same trend: AI-search visits may be smaller in volume but are producing more qualified traffic and higher conversion rates than traditional organic search.\n\n[**Amsive**](https://www.amsive.com/insights/seo/does-llm-traffic-convert-better-than-organic-a-new-data-backed-study/) found that 56% of sites saw higher conversions from AI-driven sessions, with high-traffic sites converting at **7.05% compared to 5.81%** for organic3. **Similarweb** reported a similar pattern, with AI referrals converting at **11.4% versus 5.3%** for organic across global ecommerce4.\n\nAdditional industry data supports the same direction. **Adobe Digital Insights** shows AI-referred retail conversions improving steadily year-over-year5, while **Microsoft Advertising** reports that **Copilot-powered journeys are 33% shorter and 76% more likely to lead to lower-funnel conversions**6. And though **BrightEdge** notes that AI search still represents less than 1% of referral traffic, each visit carries notably higher intent and stronger engagement7.\n\n[Microsoft Clarity’s](https://clarity.microsoft.com/) latest platform [data](https://clarity.microsoft.com/blog/ai-traffic-converts-at-3x-the-rate-of-other-channels-study/) confirms this pattern. Analyzing traffic across 1,200 publisher and news sites, Clarity reports that AI-driven referrals grew 155% over eight months and converted at up to three times the rate of traditional channels such as search and social. Even though AI referrals still represent under 1% of total visits, these users consistently display higher intent and engagement, signing up, subscribing, or purchasing at far greater rates8. Clarity now tracks AI referrals directly, distinguishing between organic AI platform visits and paid AI placements to help publishers see where their content performs best within AI experiences.\n\nThese findings suggest that AI search is not replacing organic traffic but improving the quality and outcome of each visit. Users arrive with clearer intent, encounter content that meets their needs faster, and move through the conversion path in fewer steps.\n\nFor marketers, publishers, and content owners this shift means success should be measured not just by visit volume but by quality of engagement, visibility, and downstream conversion readiness.\n\nAs more of the journey happens upstream inside AI experiences, understanding those early signals has become essential. Brands need visibility into where content is being surfaced, how users interact with it, and how those interactions translate into on-site behavior.\n\n**What This Means for News and Information Publishers**\n\nNews and information publishers often measure value differently than commercial sites. Rather than focusing on product-driven actions, success may depend on signals such as read depth, article completion, returning reader patterns, recirculation into related stories, and newsletter sign-ups or registrations.\n\nAI search can surface authoritative reporting earlier in the journey, bringing in readers who are more inclined to engage deeply with coverage or return for follow-up stories. As these upstream interactions grow, publishers benefit from visibility into how their work appears across AI answers, summaries, and comparisons, even when user journeys are shorter or involve fewer clicks.\n\n**Connecting Visibility to** **Real** **Engagement**\n\nBing Webmaster Tools continues to evolve to help site owners, publishers, and SEOs understand how content is discovered and where it appears across traditional search results and emerging AI-driven experiences. Paired with Microsoft Clarity’s AI referral insights, these tools connect upstream visibility with on-site behavior, helping teams see how discovery inside summaries, answers, and comparisons translates into real engagement. As user journeys shift toward more conversational, zero-UI-style interactions, these combined signals give a clearer view of influence, readiness, and conversion potential.\n\n![PersonHoldingFunnel.png](/getattachment/3a26ec94-dd9a-4f6a-b7a5-b0e9f8698576/PersonHoldingFunnel.png \"PersonHoldingFunnel.png\")\n\n**Rethinking Success Metrics in the Age of AI Search**\n\n*AI search is changing not only how users discover content but also how and when they demonstrate intent to act*.  Conversion is now a distributed journey influenced by every touchpoint, from summaries and comparisons to high-intent clicks.\n\nSuccess depends on connecting traditional key performance indicators (KPIs) with emerging AI search visibility signals. Rather than only tracking clicks or last-touch conversions, brands and content owners should align their analytics with signals like impressions, citations, query refinements, and answer inclusion that reflect how influence builds throughout the journey.\n\n**Ultimately, AI search provides new opportunities to connect more directly with user intent and deliver solutions that feel immediate, relevant, and personalized, whether the goal is commercial or informational.**\n\nJust as the dishwasher shopper formed confidence through AI-generated summaries, refinements, and comparisons before ever clicking, today’s conversions are increasingly shaped upstream inside the AI experience.  Those early evaluation moments, before a click ever happens, are where preference forms and intent solidifies.\n\nTo adapt, marketers should define which new visibility and engagement signals matter most for their business and map them to existing performance metrics. Tools like [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://aka.ms/bwtblogconversion) and [Microsoft Clarity](https://aka.ms/bwtblogclarity) can help surface insights into how users engage with your site, navigate to key content, and interact after discovery. By optimizing for intent, structure, and responsiveness, site owners can better capture and act on the most meaningful results that show how visibility and engagement now drive performance in AI search.\n\n**Fabrice Canel and Krishna Madhavan**\n\nPrincipal Product Managers\n\nMicrosoft Bing\n\n*To stay updated on the latest AI search strategies, continue to follow the*[*Bing Webmaster Blog*](https://aka.ms/MasteringAIBWTBlog)*.*\n\n1.
