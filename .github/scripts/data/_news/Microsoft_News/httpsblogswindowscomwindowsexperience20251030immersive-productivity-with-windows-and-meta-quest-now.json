This milestone marks the next step in our journey to redefine productivity in immersive environments:\n\n- **Seamlessly connect** to your local Windows PC or Windows 365 Cloud PC.\n- **Access multiple high-resolution virtual monitors** to boost your productivity whether at home, in the office or on the go.\n- **Block out distractions** in your own private workspace, or take advantage of passthrough and stay connected to the physical world around you.\n\n## **Get started**\n\nWith the [v81 release of Meta’s Horizon OS](https://www.meta.com/blog/horizon-os-v81-update-mixed-reality-link-store-discoverability/), this experience is rolling out to all users without the need for an experimental setting.\n\nConnecting your Meta Quest 3 or 3S headset to Windows is simple and secure. Get started by installing [Mixed Reality Link](https://aka.ms/MRLink) on your Windows 11 PC and then look at your keyboard and tap the “Pair” button to get started.
