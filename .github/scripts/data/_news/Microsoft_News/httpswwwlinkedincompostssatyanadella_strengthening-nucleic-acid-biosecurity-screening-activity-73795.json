The true test of wisdom in this era is not reactive defense, but the ability to remain several steps ahead of negative actors.\n\nSystems must be recalibrated in real time, with screening and safeguards that adapt as quickly as AI generates new possibilities. Threat search can no longer be passive; it must be active, continuous, and anticipatory, catching risks before they are spotted by those who would exploit them.\n\nThis is the essence of responsible stewardship in the age of boundless possibility: foresight as defense, vigilance as innovation.\n\nThanks [Satya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment-text)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [7 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n8 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/roger-palou-marin-phd-b963622a?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Roger Palou Marin, PhD](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/roger-palou-marin-phd-b963622a?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nSynthetic biology applied to microbiome engineering and protein design.\n\n23h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nI feel LinkedIn has become an ecochamber, everyone saying the same with really limited thought behind the posts. For example, few people pointed out that while Microsoft is collaborating to create AI for war and mass killing, it raises the flag regarding protein design. Hypocrisy? I agree it is a good point but it also raises many dangerous questions: who decides what is dangerous? how much are companies going to charge clients for this extra screening? In a world when companies do not do anything for the greater good rather than for their bottom line, I wonder which are the interest behind this work.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [2 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n3 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/fzijlstra/en?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Frank Zijlstra](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/fzijlstra/en?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nInternational Interim Executive | Transformation, Turnaround & Scale-Up | Trusted by Boards & Investors | Delivers Results in High-Pressure Environments\n\n1d\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_strengthening-nucleic-acid-biosecurity-screening-activity-7379576230414753792-zB85&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nImportant and timely research 👏.
