This requires investment and innovation in AI education, training, and job certification. We applaud the leadership of the First Lady and the White House’s AI Education Task Force. They’re helping to forge a national AI education strategy and partnering with companies across the tech sector and business community.\n\nAs we think about this national priority, we think it comes down to three things.\n\nFirst, empowering teachers and students with the latest AI tools.\n\nSecond, building AI skills. With AI moving faster than any technology in history, the only way to keep up is learning by doing and getting recognized for it.\n\nThird, creating economic opportunity by connecting these new skills to jobs. Every American should be able to showcase their AI skills and credentials to find new jobs and grow their career.\n\nHere’s what’s coming from Microsoft:\n\n- **Free Copilot in Microsoft 365 for college students.** Today, we are making Microsoft 365 Personal free for 12 months to every college student in the United States. This includes all students attending community colleges. Microsoft 365 Personal includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook with Copilot, our AI assistant, built right in. College students can sign up to access this free offer beginning today through October 31, 2025 (valid university email address required). [Learn more](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/college-student-pricing).\n\n- **Expanded access to our AI tools in schools.** [Microsoft Elevate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/elevate) will soon build on today’s announcement with expanded access to Copilot to students and teachers in schools, keeping an eye on providing the right tools and education in a safe and age-appropriate manner.\n\n- **$1.25 million in educator grants.**To celebrate and elevate outstanding teachers, Microsoft Elevate is funding $1.25 million in prizes through the Presidential AI Challenge—recognizing top educators in every state who are leading the way in AI-powered learning.\n\n- **Free LinkedIn Learning AI courses for students and teachers.**We’re unlocking free access to LinkedIn Learning courses for teachers and students that guide learners from foundational AI concepts to advanced skills—culminating in LinkedIn certifications that can be added to profiles to boost resumes and open doors to future careers.\n\n- **AI training for job seekers and certifications for community colleges.** Through new and expanded partnerships with the American Association of Community Colleges and the National Applied AI Consortium, Microsoft Elevate will sponsor no-cost AI training and certifications for faculty and staff, who serve more than 10 million students nationwide, and is providing grants to more than 30 Community Colleges across 28 states to create a community of practice AI peer learning program. Faculty and staff can sign up for training at [NAAIC](https://www.naaic.ai/events/introduction-to-generative-ai-and-microsoft-copilot-for-faculty-and-staff).\n\n- **Free LinkedIn Learning AI courses for job seekers.** With 70% of AI-related skills expected to shift by 2030, Microsoft will also launch almost 100 AI courses in 15 new LinkedIn Learning paths and host a nationwide AI Learning Challenge to help job seekers build in-demand skills and address the critical skills gap facing today’s workforce. Starting September 29, LinkedIn Learning will host an AI Learning Challenge offering 5 days of intensive, free AI education featuring expert instructors and a list of top AI voices to follow to continue learning every day.\n\nTogether, these initiatives represent a powerful investment in America’s future—ensuring that students, teachers, and job seekers across the country have the tools to thrive in the age of AI.\n\nTags: [AI](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ai/), [AI economy](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ai-economy/), [AI for Good](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/ai-for-good/), [Brad Smith](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/brad-smith/), [digital skills](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/digital-skills/), [Skills](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/skills/)",
