  "EnhancedContent": "In an era where cyberthreats evolve faster than most organizations can respond, [ContraForce](https://www.contraforce.com/) is building a future where managed service providers (MSPs) become the first line of defense against global cybercrime. This [Pegasus Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups/pegasus) startup and Microsoft cybersecurity priority is redefining security operations through automation, AI agents, and deep Microsoft product connections.\n\n[Discover Microsoft for Startups today](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/startups/)\n\n## From SOCs to startups: A founder’s journey\n\nStan Golubchik, CEO and cofounder of ContraForce, began his career in network engineering before joining Intel and later McAfee, where he helped build security operation centers (SOCs) globally. His experience with system integrators and service providers revealed a critical gap: SOCs don’t scale, and smaller providers lack the tools to defend themselves.\n\nSince an obvious solution wasn’t readily available, Golubchik was inspired to create his own. He founded ContraForce in 2021 and was accepted into Y Combinator, later backed by DataTribe and GALLOS Technologies. The company quickly aligned with Microsoft, working deeply within the Microsoft ecosystem through solutions like [Microsoft Sentinel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel/), [Microsoft Defender XDR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-xdr), and [Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id).\n\nWith ContraForce, Golubchik and the team saw an opportunity to democratize security operations by enabling MSPs—the true frontline defenders for businesses of all sizes—with enterprise-grade tools and automation. The challenge? MSPs were already providing critical services, but they lacked the support to deliver scalable security. ContraForce set out to change that.\n\n## Why security needs a new model\n\nCybersecurity isn’t just about risk and governance—it’s about operational scalability. ContraForce’s platform helps MSPs deliver enterprise-grade security services without large teams or deep technical expertise. By using AI, MSPs can significantly accelerate incident resolution and achieve substantial cost reductions per incident. This unit-of-work pricing model lets MSPs offer managed detection and response services at scale.\n\nContraForce helps customers grow top-line revenue without scaling the bottom line. Its automation capabilities enable service providers to deliver outcomes that were once only possible for large, well-funded security teams.\n\n![Blue image with white text and teal numbers and checkmarks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ContraForce_Diagram_1_900px.jpg)Figure 1. ContraForce’s platform helps managed service providers deliver enterprise-grade security at scale—reducing incident costs, accelerating resolution, and unlocking new revenue opportunities.\n\n## AI agents and the future of cyber defense\n\nThrough the [Microsoft AI Co-Innovation Lab](https://aiotlabs.microsoft.com/en) and Azure AI Foundry, ContraForce built planning agents that automate 90% of incident investigation and response tasks. These autonomous AI agents don’t just automate tasks—they help create a new cyber defense workforce. ContraForce aims to support 10,000 service providers globally by equipping them with tools to deliver security outcomes at scale.\n\nThe company is also exploring a community edition of response playbooks. This would allow MSPs to share threat intelligence and best practices—a major shift in an industry known for siloed knowledge.\n\n![Diagram with white and blue squares and black text.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ContraForce_Diagram_2_900px-e1761148850748.jpg)Figure 2. ContraForce’s AI agents, built on Azure AI Foundry, integrate with Microsoft Sentinel and Defender to deliver autonomous investigation and response at scale.\n\n## Microsoft for Startups: A catalyst for growth\n\nContraForce’s collaboration with [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/startups/) has been pivotal. Within weeks of joining the Pegasus Program, the team met with more than 30 Microsoft partners at RSA, leading to deal-stage conversations with enterprise service provider players. Microsoft’s ecosystem—from cloud to IT to security operations—has proven to be the ideal platform for startups building long-term value.\n\nThe company is now preparing for its debut on the [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Microsoft Security Store](https://securitystore.microsoft.com/), with a fast-follow launch with [Pax8’s Agent Marketplace](https://www.pax8.com/en-eu/news-post/pax8-unveils-transformational-agent-store/).\n\n## Looking ahead: A secure future for all\n\nContraForce’s vision is bold: to combat cybercrime by empowering the service providers to be the leading cyber defender workforce, serving small-to-medium businesses to enterprises at scale. By delivering autonomous security services, ContraForce is helping these providers become resilient, scalable, and impactful.\n\nCybersecurity is a team sport. ContraForce is building the tools and community to make sure everyone can play—and win.\n\nContraForce is just one example of the power of partnering with Microsoft for Startups. If you’re interested in learning more about the program—whether you’re pursuing a cybersecurity solution or something else—we’d love to learn more about what you’re building.\n\n[Get started with Microsoft for Startups today](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/startups/)",
