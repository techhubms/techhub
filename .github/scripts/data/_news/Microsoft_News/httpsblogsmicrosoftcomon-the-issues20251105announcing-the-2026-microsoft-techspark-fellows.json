This conviction inspired the creation of TechSpark, a nationwide program designed to expand economic opportunity in local communities, bridge digital gaps, and ensure everyone can participate in the digital future.\n\nAs AI continues to accelerate innovation nationwide, today we welcome the 2026 TechSpark Fellows whose visionary organizations are at the forefront of harnessing AI and cloud technology to drive transformative impact and empower their communities throughout the United States. In addition to honoring these incredible individuals and organizations, today we also announce the expansion of the TechSpark Fellows program as we launch a new Alumni program, which together creates a national network of community innovators and leaders who share best practices, resources, and ideas to ensure their communities can leverage the power of technology to thrive.\n\nSince launching the TechSpark Fellows program in 2023, Fellow organizations have joined forces with Microsoft to bridge digital divides and spark innovation. Collectively, these Fellow organizations have secured more than $249 million in follow-on funding, trained over 34,000 individuals in AI, data literacy, and emerging technologies, and built partnerships connecting public, private, and nonprofit organizations with new digital tools.\n\n[![](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/image-26.png)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/image-26.png)\n\nWith the introduction of the new 2026 TechSpark Fellows cohort, we are proud to continue building on our tradition of driving meaningful impact across the nation. Today, a TechSpark Fellow or Alumni leader can be found in every single state, as well as in more than 11 Microsoft data center communities. This widespread presence ensures that our efforts to make a difference in local communities are closely connected with our ongoing investments in infrastructure technology. By maintaining this strong network of leaders, we can foster community impact and support the growth of technology initiatives hand in hand, ensuring that progress and opportunity reach even more people across the United States.\n\nThe TechSpark Fellows program has made a significant difference in communities from California to New Jersey, across Georgia to Tennessee, and many places in between. These efforts have resulted in the creation of more than 5,100 jobs, the training of over 72,000 individuals in artificial intelligence and digital skills, and the mobilization of more than $728 million in community funding to support local projects.\n\n### Welcoming the 2026 TechSpark Fellows\n\nEach year, Microsoft TechSpark Fellows are appointed by nonprofit or community organizations that apply through a national call for participation. Each organization then receives a grant to support and scale their mission and can participate in a robust, seven-month learning and development experience designed to advance AI skilling, innovation, and adoption to support opportunity within their community.\n\nTechSpark Fellows from these organizations are already shaping projects that range from empowering women to reenter the workforce through AI upskilling to building rural digital academies to advancing youth coding and data science programs. Below are just a few inspiring examples of this year’s TechSpark Fellows and the unique ways they are driving positive change in their communities:\n\n#### **The Illinois Science & Technology Coalition and Institute**\n\n[The Illinois Science & Technology Coalition](https://www.istcoalition.org/) and Institute is strengthening the job pipeline in Illinois by connecting high school students with industry mentors for months-long, hands-on projects that reflect real workforce needs. Students work directly with professionals, including Microsoft mentors, on challenges tied to current industry priorities, gaining the skills, confidence, and experience needed to pursue careers in STEM fields. Through participation in the TechSpark Fellows program, the Illinois Science & Technology Coalition and Institute aims to expand opportunities for more schools and students across Illinois—deepening industry partnerships, strengthening hands-on learning, and preparing young people for future careers in STEM fields.\n\n#### **Climb Wyoming**\n\n[Climb Wyoming](https://climbwyoming.org/) transforms lives by helping low-income single mothers discover their full potential through integrated career training, mental health support, and meaningful employment with local employers. In Wyoming, single mothers and their children experience the highest rates of poverty in the United States, making Climb’s work both urgent and essential. The program provides immediate support and pathways to economic independence. On average, Climb graduates more than double their income two years after the program—a 121% increase in wages. As a TechSpark Fellow, Climb Wyoming looks to learn how to leverage AI and digital skilling to enhance career training for the women they serve.\n\n#### **Compudopt Georgia**\n\n[Compudopt](https://www.compudopt.org/) is closing the digital divide for families nationwide by providing free laptops and comprehensive tech education programs, from first graders to seniors. In 2025, Compudopt celebrated reaching one million people, offering digital literacy training that empowers entire households to thrive in a connected world. As part of the TechSpark Fellows program, Compudopt wants to learn how AI can further strengthen their mission, exploring new ways AI can enhance digital skilling, expand access, and help families unlock opportunities for work, learning, and daily life.\n\n### Building AI readiness for all\n\nAs we look to the future, we believe our responsibility is to continue to empower others and support their missions. The TechSpark Fellows program is just one way that we can leverage the power of technology and community to ensure that the promise of AI reaches every community across America. The progress made through TechSpark—helping leaders secure resources, equipping individuals with critical skills, and fostering innovation—demonstrates what’s possible when we work together.\n\nThe contrast in AI use across the United States reveals not just a disparity in adoption but a fundamental challenge in ensuring that AI brings people together rather than widening existing divides. Achieving an inclusive AI economy will require ongoing collaboration with local leaders, nonprofits, policymakers, and peers in the private sector.\n\nTechSpark has shown that community and local leaders are the biggest assets in ensuring their home states, hometowns, and neighbors thrive. By listening deeply, partnering with purpose, and building strong connections with local changemakers, we can make certain that everyone has the tools, opportunities, and support to thrive in the AI era.\n\nFor more insights and resources, visit the [TechSpark Playbook](https://aka.ms/TSPlaybook) and the [TechSpark Impact Report](https://aka.ms/TechSparkFellowsImpact).\n\nTags: [Skills](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/tag/skills/)",
