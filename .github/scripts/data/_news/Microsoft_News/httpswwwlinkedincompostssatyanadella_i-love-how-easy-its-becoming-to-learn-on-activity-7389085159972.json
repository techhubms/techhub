Every second of every day, someone new joins the future of coding. That's not hyperbole, it's literally happening right now on GitHub. Today we're diving into the just released 2025 Octavius report exploring how AI is reshaping software development, why TypeScript just dethroned Python, and what it means when India becomes the world's coding powerhouse. And Speaking of massive changes, we've got our resident development expert here to break down these fascinating trends. What jumped out at you first in this report? You know, the sheer scale of growth is mind blowing. 36 million new developers joining GitHub in just the past. Here, that means GitHub now has more than 180 million developers. To put that in perspective, that's like adding a new developer every single second. Wait, every second. That's incredible. What's driving this massive surge? Well, a big catalyst was actually GitHub Copilot becoming free in late 2024. That really opened the floodgates. And here's what's fascinating 80% of new developers start using AI tools like Copilot in their very first week. That's such a shift. From just a few years ago when AI was seen as this optional add-on. Exactly. The report highlights three major shifts, and AI becoming standard is definitely one of them. What are the other two? Well, TypeScript overtaking both Python And JavaScript as the most used language on GitHub is huge. This is the biggest language shift in over a decade. You know, I remember when JavaScript was the undisputed king of web development. Things really do change fast in tech. They sure do. And the third shift is how AI is. Actually influencing which tools and languages developers choose to use. Can you break that down a bit? So developers are increasingly choosing typed languages like TypeScript because they work better with AI coding assistance in production environments. Interesting. And nearly every major front end framework now defaults to TypeScript, which has really accelerated its adoption. Let's talk about the activity levels, what our developers actually doing with all these tools. The numbers are staggering. Developers are creating more than 230 new repositories. Every minute, every minute. Yeah. And they pushed nearly 1 billion commits in 2025 alone, with a record of almost 100 million just in August. Those numbers are hard to even wrap your head around. And here's something really interesting about AI adoption. Over 1.1 million public repositories now use an LMS DK. What's the growth rate on that? It's up 178% year over year, with almost 700,000 of those projects created in just the last 12 months. Massive growth rate on that. Pull requests are up too developers merged 518.7 million of them, a 29% increase from last year Let's talk about the global aspect. I noticed some interesting trends about India yes this is fascinating. India added more than 5 million developers just this year That's what like 14% of all new accounts exactly and they're projected to account for one in every three new developers on GitHub by 20-30. You know this reminds me of how social media platforms experience these massive. Growth phases. The parallel is interesting, but this is actually more significant because it's about creation, not just consumption. Exactly. Let's dig deeper into the AI aspect. How is it changing the actual development process? Well, GitHub just announced something called Agent HQ at their Universe conference. What's that about? It's basically transforming GitHub into a unified control plane for managing multiple AI coding agents from different companies. So instead of being locked into one AI assistant, you can use multiple. Exactly, they're calling it wave 2 of AI assisted development. What was wave one? Wave one was basically just code completion. This new wave is about multimodal AI native experiences. And all of this is happening while TypeScript takes the crown as the most used language, Right? Though Python is still dominant for AI and data science workloads specifically. It's interesting how different languages are finding their specific niches, and the JavaScript TypeScript ecosystem combined still accounts for more overall. Activity than Python alone. So what does all this mean for the future of development? I think we're seeing a fundamental shift in how software gets built. How so? Well, when 80% of new developers start with AI tools, it's not just an add-on anymore. It's becoming the default way to code. And with India's growing influence, we're seeing a real shift in where code is being written too. Exactly. The center of gravity in software development is definitely shifting eastward. It's pretty amazing how much can change in just one year. And remember, this is all happening while we're adding a new developer every second, which means by the time someone finishes listening to this episode, hundreds of new developers will have joined the community. Well, that brings us to the end of today's episode of Copilot Podcasts. And by the time we finish this sentence, a few more developers will have started their coding journey. Thanks for listening, everyone. Keep coding and remember the future of development is being written right now, one commit at a time.\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Satya Nadella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyanadella?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nChairman and CEO at Microsoft\n\n21h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_i-love-how-easy-its-becoming-to-learn-on-activity-7389085159972593664-d87n&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nRead the full report: [https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1?trk=public_post_comment-text)/\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_i-love-how-easy-its-becoming-to-learn-on-activity-7389085159972593664-d87n&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_i-love-how-easy-its-becoming-to-learn-on-activity-7389085159972593664-d87n&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [58 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_i-love-how-easy-its-becoming-to-learn-on-activity-7389085159972593664-d87n&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n59 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://tw.linkedin.com/in/mike-liu-voice?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Mike Liu](https://tw.linkedin.com/in/mike-liu-voice?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nAuthor of 19 Books on Language, Power & AI | Linguist | AI Communication Expert | Founder, Mike’s Strategic Communications\n\n21h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_i-love-how-easy-its-becoming-to-learn-on-activity-7389085159972593664-d87n&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nThis is a great example of how AI and podcasting are reshaping the way we consume information.
