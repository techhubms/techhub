We're this is the first time this has been on air. First the training hardware. Now Clippy is back. The Clippy is reborn. Yes. Incredible. Clippy walked so Miko could run. Yes. Yeah. And so we got to pay homage to our roots. And so Satya, when he saw this, demanded. Yes, that Clippy. I'm so happy inside this. We've been begging for this. It's just great. Lower your parents hated it. So the kids loved. Exactly. And it was cool to love it. Everybody else got them, and so it's so ready to bring it back. So I just, yeah, somebody good. So many good memories of being in the computer lab at school and just looking down and knowing that Clippy was there.

Its reappearance might be more about charming familiarity than a direct re-application of its original assistance model.
