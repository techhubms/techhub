  "EnhancedContent": "Every year, the [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us) strives to empower student entrepreneurs from across the globe by highlighting their innovative technology solutions using Microsoft technology to create real-world impact.\n\nWith the next round of the competition coming up soon, we wanted to take the opportunity to provide some inspiration for 2026 competitors by sharing the story of Argus, a breakthrough wearable assistive device developed by Stanford University undergraduates Daniel Kim and Arjun Oberoi, and the winner of the 2025 Microsoft Imagine Cup.\n\n[Learn more about Imagine Cup](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us)\n\n## A deeply personal inspiration\n\nThe inspiration for Argus is deeply personal, stemming from Kim’s observations of his grandmother struggling with her vision after a detached retina. Similarly, Oberoi witnessed his grandfather coping with macular degeneration. Inspired by watching the challenges experienced by their loved ones, Kim and Oberoi decided to create a solution. The result is a two-part wearable system that identifies objects, recognizes faces, and provides spatial guidance, all through voice interaction.\n\nTheir invention is called the Argus Panoptes, the “all‑seeing one,” and the device is designed to empower people with low vision to navigate the physical world with more freedom. In doing so, Kim and Oberoi hope to spare others the challenges that impaired vision brings, and grant those impacted with the confidence and autonomy to live a fuller life.\n\n## Powered by Azure: Intelligent, efficient, inclusive\n\nArgus runs on a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) and Azure AI Speech. It is a piece of wearable hardware that uses local edge to process simple commands and cloud-based inference for more complex tasks.\n\nThe standout innovation, however, is Wi‑R, an ultra-low-power wireless protocol that uses skin surface conduction to improve internet connectivity—all while consuming 100 times less power than traditional Wi‑Fi. That means better responsiveness and fewer battery changes for the end user—which can often be challenging for elderly or differently abled end users.\n\n## From the dorm to the “Basement” to the top prize\n\nThe Argus team first encountered [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups) as part of their participation in Stanford University startup programs, most notably Stanford Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES), where Microsoft for Startups partners with the student-led organization to ensure that promising Stanford startups have access to both the technology and technical support to create the most innovative ideas they can imagine.\n\nArgus then gained additional exposure to Microsoft during their run at the Red Bull Basement 2024 competition, where the cofounders managed to place in the Red Bull Basement U.S. National Final. That win continued to fuel an accelerated journey that culminated with the Imagine Cup—a win that completely changed the trajectory of their company.\n\n> >\n> **When we think back about this whole process, all it took was an application to Red Bull Basement, and suddenly, all these other things happened. We didn’t realize that this would accumulate to winning $100,000, figuring out all these learnings, and meeting all these people along the way. You never know what’s going to tip that snowball, and there are almost always ways that you can find the time, if the idea is something that really matters to you.**\n> >\n> —**Daniel Kim, Member of Winning Team of the 2025 Microsoft Imagine Cup**\n\n## Inspiring other students—and Microsoft\n\nArgus represents the future of assistive tech: smart, accessible, and thoughtfully designed.\n\n> >\n> **Every time I meet the Imagine Cup finalists, I’m inspired by their passion, ingenuity and the bold ways they’re using AI to tackle problems that matter in their communities and around the world. They’re not just imagining what is possible with AI—they’re building it. I can’t wait to see how these startups continue to shape the future.**\n> >\n> —**Annie Pearl, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of Azure Experiences and Ecosystems at Microsoft**\n\nAt Microsoft for Startups, we are proud to support student founders like Daniel and Arjun through resources, mentorship, and scalable Azure infrastructure. Their journey from classroom to world stage embodies our mission: empowering founders to build for good.\n\nIf Argus’s story has inspired you with its ingenuity, inclusive design, and transformative impact, consider applying to the Imagine Cup 2026. Whether you’re solving accessibility challenges, climate issues, or educational gaps, your idea could be the next to change the world.\n\nStart building today with Microsoft for Startups and explore how Azure’s AI platforms can help bring your vision to life. We look forward to seeing you in the [Imagine Cup 2026](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us).\n\n[Get started with Microsoft for Startups today](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/startups/)",
