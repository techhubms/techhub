It’s now a dynamic canvas for culture. It can breathe life into ancestral knowledge, preserve endangered languages, give form to lived experiences, and become a vessel for empathy and understanding. A new generation of Indigenous creators are leveraging this canvas, not just to tell their stories, but to reshape how history is remembered and how futures are imagined.\n\nThrough games, indigenous creators are reclaiming the narrative; telling stories of survival, resilience, joy and identity rooted in tradition and grounded in truth. When Indigenous creators make games that reflect their cultures, these games become vessels for continuity, remembrance, and self-determination – and, from those playing them, new understanding.\n\nThis year, in honor of the **International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples**, Xbox is proud to spotlight Indigenous voices reshaping the world of interactive storytelling. Among them is **Anthony Brave**, a Sicangu Oyate (Rosebud Sioux Tribe) and Chippewa-Cree descendant, who served as the lead cultural expert on *Age of Empires III: Definitive Edition*.\n\nAnthony helped ensure Indigenous representation in the game was accurate, nuanced, and deeply respectful. He also penned **‘Shadow’**, the second act in *The War Chiefs* storyline, an emotionally rich campaign told through the perspective of an Indigenous protagonist navigating the complexities of identity, survival, and legacy.\n\nAs a consultant, writer, and cultural ambassador, Anthony’s work exemplifies what’s possible when Indigenous creators are empowered to tell their own stories. Through his voice, and those of other creators featured in our **curated collection of games by and about Indigenous communities**, we see a new standard emerging, one where consultation is expected, and cultural respect is foundational.\n\nWhen history gets a new perspective directly from the source, everyone benefits. These stories do more than entertain; they teach, challenge, and inspire. They remind us that tradition is not stuck in the past. It is active, evolving, and ready to shape the future.\n\nJoin us in celebrating Indigenous creators, honoring their contributions to gaming, and supporting a more thoughtful and truthful way of telling stories today and for generations to come.\n\n# **PLAY**\n\n## **Discover Games Shaped by Indigenous Communities**\n\n![A stylized Xbox logo in support of International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples featuring the Xbox sphere with a green basket weave texture on a background with a night sky, a cypress tree, mushrooms, twinkling lights, and basket weave border.](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/07/FY26-SocialImpact-IDWIP_MultiIP_WireCut-1920x1080-1-70f9d55e5c16029fc9c3-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nCelebrate International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples through the power of play.
