Browsers have always been our gateway to the web, but they’ve never truly worked alongside us. The experience has been static for too long. When was the last time you questioned your browser?\n\n[!\\[\\](https://blogs.windows.com/wp-content/themes/microsoft-stories-theme/img/theme/shims/16x9.png)](https://youtu.be/CLH8gU--YBU)\n\nWe at Microsoft Edge are constantly reimagining what your browser can do and bringing the latest AI features directly into your browser. In July, with the launch of [Copilot Mode in Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/07/28/introducing-copilot-mode-in-edge-a-new-way-to-browse-the-web/), we introduced innovative AI features such as a streamlined new tab page to start a chat, search or navigate the web, reasoning across multiple open tabs with ease, and a dynamic pane that helps you keep the context of your webpage. With these features, you are actually able to achieve things, instead of just scrolling. Say you’re planning a dinner party for friends. You can compare recipes across multiple tabs, summarize the instructions and create a cooking schedule that maximizes your single oven time.\n\nStarting today, we are bringing even more features into Copilot Mode, turning your browser into a dynamic, intelligent companion that anticipates, assists and accelerates your experience online—all with your permission. Edge is the browser that you can talk to and that’s there when you need it as you browse the web. Now, Copilot Mode in Edge brings you right back to where you left off in past sessions, so you don’t have to collect too many open tabs. Edge can complete multi-step actions for you, so you don’t spend half a day planning a two-hour walking tour. And it provides richer insights using your past browsing history, if you choose to enable it, so your dream vacation doesn’t become a nightmare to plan. All this, backed by Microsoft’s standards of security, privacy and performance.\n\n![Animated GIF showing Copilot Mode in Edge in action.](https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/33/2025/10/Journeys_v1-2.gif)\n\nAnd you’re always in control of your AI browsing experience. You can choose to turn on Copilot Mode to try the newest features that create a smarter, more seamless experience on the web, or if at any time you prefer to go back to today’s classic experience it is simply a toggle click away.\n\nTry Copilot Mode in Edge today at [aka.ms/copilot-mode](https://aka.ms/copilot-mode).\n\n## **Get tasks handled for you with Copilot Actions in Edge**\n\nWith natural, conversational voice, you can tell Copilot in Edge what you want it to do and free up time to focus on what’s important. Use Actions with Voice to perform simple tasks like opening a webpage or go straight to the information you’re looking for without having to scroll for ages.\n\nYou can also use chat to perform complex actions that give you back even more time. Trying to curb your shopping habit? Have Copilot go through your inbox and tell it to unsubscribe you from all those tempting shopping newsletters. Or Copilot can make that restaurant reservation freeing you up to focus on planning the rest of your evening out. Soon, you will also be able to use your browser to talk to Copilot and complete these complex tasks. Currently, Copilot Actions in Edge is available for free in a limited preview in the U.S. only.\n\n![Animated GIF showing Copilot Actions in Edge.](https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/33/2025/10/Actions_v2_slower.gif)\n\n## **Jump back in with Journeys**\n\nRemember that project you started a while back but life got in the way? No need to bookmark all those tabs. Journeys, first announced in July, is now here and it brings you back exactly where you left off and suggests smart next steps. With Journeys, you see your past browsing projects automatically grouped into helpful topics and you can dive right back in, all with your explicit permission. Be the first to try it today—currently, Journeys is available for free in a limited preview in the U.S. only.\n\nAlso new in this release, Copilot Mode in Edge can now use your browsing history, with your permission, to provide higher quality responses. Chat with Copilot about that blue hoodie you were looking at last week or to recommend a movie based on your previous likes. Your browsing history will never be accessed without your go-ahead; opt-in via Page Context in Settings and turn off whenever you want.\n\n![Animated GIF showing how Copilot Mode in Edge can now use your browsing history.](https://winblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/33/2025/10/History_v2.gif)\n\n## **You’re always in control**\n\nYou can choose to turn on Copilot Mode in Edge to try the newest features for a smarter, more seamless browsing experience—or switch back to classic anytime with a simple toggle. When Copilot is active, you’ll see clear visual cues, so you know when it’s taking an action, listening or viewing.\n\nWith Copilot Mode in Edge, your data stays yours. Microsoft only collects what’s needed to improve your experience—or what you choose to provide via Personalization settings. Copilot follows Microsoft’s trusted privacy standards, meaning your information is never shared without your permission. Your browser data is protected under the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacy/privacystatement?msockid=0c04db3e2108600f1a88cbe820d46128), and you can turn Copilot Mode on or off anytime.\n\nIn addition to all the latest AI innovation in Copilot Mode, your browsing experience is made more secure with our other AI features. [Scareware blocker](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/scareware-blocker?form=MA13FJ) uses local AI to help protect you from full-screen scam takeovers and is enabled by default for Edge users on qualifying devices. Plus, for added peace of mind, Edge offers [password management features](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/features/password-management?form=MA13FJ) to make password security effortless. Our password management features help you create strong passwords, store them safely and monitor them for breaches 24/7. You stay in control with instant alerts and easy password updates.\n\n## **Tell us what you think**\n\nCopilot Mode in Edge is available in [all Copilot markets](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/supported-regions-and-languages-in-microsoft-copilot-26de43a1-c176-4908-bef7-29c8c37ac7ce), exclusively on Edge for Windows and Mac\\* and coming soon to the Edge mobile app. We are excited to bring you all these Copilot features directly in your Edge browser and we want to hear from you.
