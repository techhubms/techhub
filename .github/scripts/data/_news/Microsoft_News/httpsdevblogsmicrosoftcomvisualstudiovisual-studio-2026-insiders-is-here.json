  "EnhancedContent": "**Visual Studio 2026 Insiders is here – and it marks one of the most ambitious steps forward we’ve taken with the IDE.**\n\nThis release brings AI woven directly into the developer workflow, performance improvements that reset expectations for speed at enterprise scale, and a modern design that makes the environment feel lighter and more focused.\n\nAnd for the first time, we’re introducing the new **Insiders Channel**, which replaces the long-standing Preview Channel as the way developers can get early access to upcoming features.\n\nThis is a release you can feel the moment you start using it – [download the Insiders release](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/insiders/) and [check out the release notes](https://aka.ms/vs/relnotes/insiders) and see for yourself**.** And don’t miss out on [Copilot Free](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/copilot-free-plan) to unleash the full power of AI in Visual Studio 2026.\n\n﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Sorry, your browser doesn’t support embedded videos.It’s all part of a simple but powerful goal: keeping developers in flow so you can spend less time fighting the tooling and more time solving the hard problems that matter. The IDE is made *by developers, for developers* – and you will always be at the center of the experience. Here’s a teaser of some of the things you can find in this new version:\n\n## AI Integrated Development\n\nAI in Visual Studio 2026 isn’t bolted on. It’s woven into the daily rhythms of coding. Think of it as a quiet partner that knows your solution, respects your muscle memory, and offers help that’s timely rather than intrusive.\n\nYou’ll notice it when you drop into a new codebase and the IDE helps you understand what you’re looking at, suggests the kinds of tests that usually get written in your repo, and keeps your docs and comments in step with your code. You’ll feel it when a “paste and fix” moment becomes a single confirmation because the editor adapts the snippet to your project’s patterns and conventions. And when performance questions pop up, you won’t be guessing – guidance is grounded in real traces and validated with benchmarks, so fixes come with confidence, not hope.\n\nCode reviews start with clear, actionable insights about correctness, performance, and security – on your machine, before you ever open a pull request. Through it all, **you stay in control**. The IDE takes the busy-work; **you keep the judgment**. The result is simple: you move faster, and your code gets better.\n\n[![profiler agent image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAyAAAAH3AQMAAAB5GqmVAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAR0lEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANwYxnMAAUs5LMgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/profiler-agent-1.gif)\n\n*The Profiler Agent can identify and fix performance issues in your code.*\n\n### Blazing fast performance\n\nSpeed shapes what you can build in a day. In 2026, the loops you run most – opening solutions, navigating code, building, and pressing F5 – tighten up. You’ll notice that first launch feels snappier, big solutions feel lighter, and the time between an idea and a running app keeps shrinking. The gains show up on large codebases and they hold across both x64 and Arm64, so your machine’s power turns directly into developer velocity.\n\nYou’ll feel it when you can jump between branches without losing your stride, when a full build doesn’t break your flow, and when pressing F5 is something you do instinctively because the wait is measured in moments.\n\nEarly feedback says it plainly:\n\n- “HOLY […] this is FAST.” – early previewer\n- “It’s blazing fast on all my projects.” – Visual Studio MVP\n\n### A modern look and feel\n\nClarity matters when you live in an IDE. Visual Studio 2026 introduces a cleaner and more modern visual language. The result is a workspace that feels calm and intentional.\n\nYou’ll notice crisper lines, **improved iconography**, and better spacing of visual elements. **Options** feel approachable rather than overwhelming, so tuning the IDE to your preferences is quick instead of delicate.\n\n**Managing extensions** is straightforward, and a plethora of **new color themes** help your environment feel personal – comfortable for long sessions, focused when the pressure is on, and accessible by default.\n\nIt’s a design that respects your attention and helps you stay oriented, even in the largest solutions.\n\n[![old fluent ui image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA7YAAAKDAQMAAAAU9ARxAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAYUlEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVP7W8GoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgDctdwABYhaDPAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/old_fluent-ui.png)\n\n*Visual Studio 2026 redesigned using Fluent UI and ships with 11 new tinted themes*\n\n## Try it today\n\nReady to see the future of Visual Studio? You can get started right now:\n\n- [Download Visual Studio 2026 Insider](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/insiders/)\n- [Get GitHub Copilot Free](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/copilot-free-plan)\n- [Read the release notes](https://aka.ms/vs/relnotes/preview)\n- [Developer Community Feedback](https://aka.ms/devcom)\n\nVisual Studio 2026 installs side-by-side with earlier versions, and if you’re on Visual Studio 2022 you can import components and settings to get coding right away.\n\nThis is just the beginning. We’ll ship **monthly updates** that bring the latest performance improvements, design refinements, and AI innovations. And over the coming weeks, we’ll share deeper dives right here on the blog, so make sure to come back soon.\n\n## Thank you\n\nVisual Studio has always been about more than code – it’s about the community of developers who build, grow, and push us to make the IDE better every day. Thank you for being part of this journey and for making Visual Studio the IDE trusted by millions worldwide.\n\n**Happy coding,** The Visual Studio Team\n\n### Known issue\n\nThere’s a[known issue](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Errors-seen-immediately-following-new-in/10962760) that can cause errors to show up for some users.
