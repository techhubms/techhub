MAI-Image-1 is now an option alongside DALL-E 3 and GPT4o in the model menu, enabling you to experiment and pick the model that best matches your creative goals.\n\nTry it in Copilot Audio Expressions: Now, when you select Story Mode, [Audio Expressions](https://copilot.microsoft.com/labs/audio-expression?audiomode=story) will use MAI-Image-1 to visualize your story with a unique image.\n\nMAI-Image-1 is currently available in all countries that can access Bing Image Creator and Copilot Labs, excluding the EU at present.\n\nEarlier Announcement – October 13, 2025:\n\nToday, we’re announcing MAI-Image-1, our first image generation model developed entirely in-house, debuting in the top 10 text-to-image models on [LMArena](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard/text-to-image).\n\nAt Microsoft AI, we’re creating AI for everyone – a supportive, helpful presence always in the service of humanity. We’ve shared how purpose-built models are essential for this mission, and we announced [our first two in-house models](https://microsoft.ai/news/two-new-in-house-models/) in August. MAI-Image-1 marks the next step on our journey and paves the way for more immersive, creative and dynamic experiences inside our products.\n\nWe trained this model with the goal of delivering genuine value for creators, and we put a lot of care into avoiding repetitive or generically-stylized outputs. For example, we prioritized rigorous data selection and nuanced evaluation focused on tasks that closely mirror real-world creative use cases – taking into account feedback from professionals in the creative industries. This model is designed to deliver real flexibility, visual diversity and practical value.\n\nMAI-Image-1 excels at generating photorealistic imagery, like lighting (e.g., bounce light, reflections), landscapes, and much more. This is particularly so when compared to many larger, slower models. Its combination of speed and quality means users can get their ideas on screen faster, iterate through them quickly, and then transfer their work to other tools to continue refining.\n\n![A roadrunner with brown and white streaked feathers runs across a sandy desert with sparse shrubs.
