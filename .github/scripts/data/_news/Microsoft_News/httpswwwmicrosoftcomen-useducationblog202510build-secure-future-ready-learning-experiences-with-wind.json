Explore your upgrade options today and plan with confidence.\n\nToday’s classrooms are more connected than ever—diverse in learning needs, multilingual in makeup, and increasingly reliant on secure, reliable technology. As educators navigate this dynamic landscape, the upgrade to Windows 11 Education offers a timely opportunity to support instruction, assessments, and engagement while adapting to evolving security needs and emerging AI-powered tools. These demands require technology platforms that can adapt and scale with educational needs.\n\nAt Microsoft, we recognize the evolving needs of educators and institutions—and we see them as opportunities to provide meaningful support through a secure, high-performing platform. Windows 11 helps you simplify IT, support equity, and unlock future-ready learning.\n\nLet’s explore how Windows 11 is built to securely support today’s educational needs and deliver AI-powered experiences. We’ll also highlight your upgrade paths to Windows 11 as Windows 10 approaches end of support (EOS) on October 14, 2025.\n\n## Secure by design, ready for the modern classroom\n\nAs learning continues to become more connected and digital-first, having a [secure technology foundation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/cybersecurity-solutions-for-schools) is more important than ever. Windows 11 was built with this in mind—combining modern protections with performance and usability.\n\n[Microsoft Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender) provides real-time protection that updates automatically, helping you stay ahead of evolving digital risks with less manual work. Hardware-level security features like Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 are built in, helping safeguard student and school data at every level—from classroom to district.\n\nThese capabilities don’t just protect—they help you simplify. With centralized management through [Microsoft Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-Intune), your IT teams can more easily promote consistency across devices and reduce time spent on maintenance and troubleshooting.\n\n![Three students working together on a laptop in a school classroom.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-Education-classroom-scene-52-1024x683.jpg)\n\nPerformance matters too. Windows 11 provides practical enhancements to the classroom experience, including faster boot times, improved multitasking capabilities, extended battery life, and accessibility tools such as voice typing and live captions—all designed to empower every student to participate and succeed.\n\n[Discover built-in tools for accessible learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/learning-tools/accessibility-tools)\n\nExplore how Windows 11 can help you save time, track progress, and support diverse learning needs in the classroom.\n\n## Scale digital learning\n\nCeibal, a government agency in Uruguay, was founded to universalize access to digital technology in the Uruguayan public education system and is the largest education Microsoft tenant in Latin America. In 2023 they adopted Windows 11 as the main operating system and more than 240,000 students and teachers across Uruguay were using Windows 11 PCs. Their learning management system (LMS) CREA saw usage rates increase from 55% in 2019 to 86% in 2024.1 The migration also delivered practical benefits: maintenance and update costs decreased, and compatibility between software and hardware improved significantly.\n\n> >\n> Prior to moving to Windows 11, maintenance and update costs were higher because each device model had its own OS version. Additionally, compatibility between software and hardware made things even more difficult. By integrating Windows 11, everything became much quicker and simpler with added security.\n> >\n> Mateo Pérez, Product Coordinator at Ceibal\n\n[Learn how Ceibal increased engagement with Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/1765557729347084897-ceibal-windows-10-higher-education-en-uruguay)\n\n## Forward-looking platform for personalized learning\n\nWindows 11 is built to support not just today’s educational needs, but tomorrow’s innovations. As AI continues to become an [integral part of teaching and learning](https://aka.ms/AIinEDUReport), schools need tools that are both powerful and practical—helping educators adapt without requiring them to overhaul their workflows.\n\nOne example is Microsoft Learning Zone, a Windows app designed to save educators time while enhancing student engagement. Built for Copilot+ PCs, Learning Zone uses on-device AI to help educators create personalized, interactive lessons from the materials they already use—turning a worksheet or slide deck into student-ready activities in minutes.\n\n[Discover more about Microsoft Learning Zone](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educationblog/whats-new-in-microsoft-edu---back-to-school-august-2025/4425287)\n\nWhether introducing new concepts, reinforcing key ideas, or tailoring practice to individual learners, Learning Zone puts AI directly into the teaching workflow—responsibly and privately. Because it runs on the device, educators stay in control of both content and student data.\n\n![Microsoft Learning Zone interface showing the create a new lesson page with lesson tiles and navigation options.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-Learning-Zone-U-I-example-1024x576.webp)\n\nAvailable in public preview, Learning Zone shows how Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs can support modern instruction while preserving privacy and empowering educator creativity. Educators can also use built-in trusted content from world-class partners—from NASA’s hands-on exploration and OpenStax’s Rice University-backed curriculum to Minecraft Education’s immersive game-based learning and Kahoot!’s AI-powered instant quiz generation—all seamlessly integrated and ready to inspire student curiosity from day one.\n\n## Planning your upgrade to Windows 11 Education\n\nWith [Windows 10 support ending](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025-2ca8b313-1946-43d3-b55c-2b95b107f281) on October 14, 2025, you have several options to keep your learning environments secure and AI-ready. Every institution is in a different place with budgets and timelines, so the transition doesn’t have to happen all at once. Microsoft offers three flexible paths to help institutions transition based on their budget and readiness.\n\n[Learn more about Windows 10 end of support](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/)\n\n### Option 1: Upgrading eligible devices\n\nMany existing devices are compatible with Windows 11. Microsoft offers a free tool called [PC Health Check](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/check-if-a-device-meets-windows-11-system-requirements-after-changing-device-hardware-f3bc0aeb-6884-41a1-ab57-88258df6812b) that tells you if your device meets the requirements for Windows 11. Schools can use Microsoft Intune to upgrade at no additional cost—unlocking immediate security, performance, and accessibility improvements without investing in new hardware.\n\n### Option 2: Making the most of device transitions\n\nWhen it’s time to purchase new Windows 11 PCs, to help ensure older devices are responsibly recycled or repurposed whenever possible, we encourage the [use of trade-in](https://www.microsoft.com/store/b/microsoft-trade-in) and [recycling programs](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/compliance/recycling) available through our retail and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners. To help schools stretch their budgets, eligible devices can be securely recycled with cashback to offset new purchases through select programs. For devices that don’t qualify for trade-in, Microsoft’s end-of-life management programs support sustainability goals through responsible recycling.\n\nYou can also explore [Shape the Future](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/windows#ShapetheFuture), a Microsoft discount program that helps K–12 education institutions access affordable Windows 11 PCs and promote digital equity.\n\n#### Free planning tools to support your Windows 11 upgrade\n\nMicrosoft offers resources to help assess and plan your upgrade to Windows 11. These tools are designed to give you clear insights and support confident decision-making.\n\n- [**Windows EOS Devices Calculator**](https://tei.forrester.com/go/microsoft/windows10eos/): Estimate the benefits and costs of upgrading or understand what it takes to maintain Windows 10 devices securely after support ends.\n- [**Windows 11 Migration Assessment**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/1020523c-e223-432c-8be1-ebbb348f8130/): Evaluate your institution’s readiness for Windows 11 and get practical recommendations for your transition.\n\n### Option 3: Phase your rollout\n\nIf replacing all devices at once isn’t possible, consider a hybrid plan. For eligible devices, upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 and enroll in the [Extended Security Update (ESU)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-consumer-extended-security-updates-esu-program-33e17de9-36b3-43bb-874d-6c53d2e4bf42) program for licenses on a per device basis until you’re ready to fully transition. The ESU program allows covered devices to continue to receive security updates for up to three years. ESU pricing for Microsoft Education customers will be $1 per device for the first year, $2 the following year, and $4 the third year to help institutions receive the support they need.2 This offer is extended to all education customers, including K-12 and higher education.\n\n## Invest in AI-powered learning\n\n![Two education leaders collaborating in an office at an educational institution.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Microsoft-Education-I-T-professionals-34-1024x683.jpg)\n\nSchools ready to [enhance productivity through AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/ai-in-education) can consider Copilot+ PCs. These Windows 11 PCs, in comparison to traditional devices, deliver faster performance, longer battery life, and on-device AI experiences that support a long-term investment in educational innovation.
