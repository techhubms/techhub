With AI expected to contribute over USD 3.6 trillion to the global economy by 2034, Africa has a potential gain of up to USD 1.5 trillion by 2030 if adoption accelerates. Kenya, already recognized among the top five most AI-ready nations in Africa, is taking deliberate steps to lead in responsible and inclusive AI adoption. Despite the growing momentum, Kenya’s AI ecosystem has remained fragmented, with efforts spread across different sectors and institutions.\n\nThe launch of KAISA is intended to bridge this gap by providing a coordinated national framework that connects skills, policy, and innovation. The Alliance will bring together government, academia, private sector, civil society, and development partners to align training with industry needs, promote ethical AI use, and expand access to opportunities for youth, women, and marginalized groups.\n\nDr. Ehud Gachugu*,* Deputy CEO at KEPSA and Global Director for Youth and Jobs, emphasized that the launch of the Kenya AI Skilling Alliance marks a defining moment in Kenya’s journey to build a future-ready workforce for the age of Artificial Intelligence. He noted that as AI continues to transform how people live, learn, and work, the Alliance will help coordinate, scale, and accelerate existing efforts across the public and private sectors. “*KAISA is focused on inclusivity, job creation, and social transformation, Africa’s youthful population remains our greatest advantage. Through coordinated efforts, the Alliance will connect innovation with opportunity, enhance the quality of training, and scale successful models that empower communities to participate meaningfully in the global digital economy.”*\n\nMicrosoft’s partnership with KEPSA through KAISA builds on ongoing digital skilling programs that have already trained thousands of young Kenyans and small businesses in emerging technologies. Through this new platform, Microsoft and KEPSA will expand their collaboration to include curriculum development, innovation incubation, and research partnerships across sectors such as agriculture, health, education, finance, and manufacturing.\n\nPhyllis Migwi, Country General Manager, Microsoft, Kenya, underscored that technology alone cannot drive progress without people who are ready and equipped to use it. She emphasized that Kenya’s ambition to become Africa’s AI talent hub will only be realized through deliberate investment in skills development, from basic digital literacy to advanced expertise. She challenged the narrative that Africans are merely high adopters of technology, urging a shift toward becoming active creators and innovators within the AI ecosystem. Through the Kenya AI Skilling Alliance, she noted, Kenya has the opportunity to build a future-ready workforce capable of leveraging AI to create jobs, drive innovation, and shape policies that define the country’s digital future*. “We can put all the technology we want into a nation, but if we don’t have the people ready to take advantage of it, it doesn’t work. Skills, not just innovation, will determine how far Kenya goes in the AI era.”*\n\nSpeaking during the launch, Ambassador Phillip Thigo, Special Envoy on Technology, Government of Kenya delivered a deeply reflective address on Kenya’s place in the emerging “era of intelligence”, emphasizing that technology must serve humanity, not the other way around. He urged that Kenya’s AI journey be rooted in agency, intentionality, and inclusivity, ensuring that every citizen, regardless of background, can navigate and benefit from technological transformation. He cautioned against reducing AI to a buzzword, reminding the audience that while artificial intelligence has existed for decades, the new frontier lies in how societies adapt and apply it to local realities. *“We must make deliberate choices to ensure that AI works for good, that it helps us fight climate change, not fuel it. The true test of innovation is whether our technologies can sustain the planet and empower people at the same time. To achieve this, we must build our own knowledge and science in AI; otherwise, we risk remaining users rather than creators in the next chapter of human progress. We can’t train for everything; technology is evolving every day but what matters is the capability and confidence we build in people to take ownership of their learning and adapt as the world changes. That’s the real goal.”*\n\nThe launch also outlined KAISA’s 24-month roadmap, which includes establishing *sector-based working groups to guide AI adoption in key industries, rolling out national skilling programs, and creating an AI repository and innovation hub to showcase local use cases*. The platform will also promote *research partnerships, policy engagement, and ethical governance frameworks* to ensure AI deployment supports inclusive economic growth.\n\nAlso speaking was Ms. Caroline Njuki, Chief Technical Advisor, ILO, Kenya, who emphasized the importance of ensuring that artificial intelligence serves as a tool for inclusion, fairness, and shared prosperity. Ms. Njuki called on all stakeholders to leverage the Kenya AI Skilling Alliance as a platform that connects innovation, ethics, and decent work, ensuring that AI becomes a driver of dignity, productivity, and inclusion for all. *“As Kenya sets its sights on becoming a continental AI hub, our shared goal must be to ensure that no one is left behind. That AI becomes a true driver of dignity, productivity, and inclusion for all.”*\n\nA panel session moderated by Ms. Winnie Karanu, AI National Skills Director, Microsoft Elevate Skills, Kenya themed: “*Unlocking Kenya’s AI Future: Building a Collaborative Ecosystem for Skills, Innovation, and Inclusion”* explored how Kenya can bridge skills gaps, promote homegrown AI innovation, and foster meaningful collaboration between academia, startups, and industry. Speakers including Mr. Somanna Palacanda – International Field Director, Microsoft Elevate Skills noted the importance of developing market-relevant training, mentorship, and incubation programs that connect learning to real work opportunities. They also called for greater investment in applied research, data governance, and youth-driven innovation to keep Kenya at the forefront of Africa’s AI transformation.\n\nAs KAISA moves forward, KEPSA and Microsoft are inviting partners from government, academia, private sector, and development organizations to join the Alliance and co-create Kenya’s AI future. By coming together under this national platform, partners will help shape policy, advance research and innovation, and implement practical programs that build skills and employment pathways in the AI-driven economy.

Through this platform, KEPSA and Microsoft aim to position Kenya as a continental model for responsible, scalable, and human-centered AI adoption that leaves no one behind.\n\n***Picture Caption**: Ambassador Phillip Thigo, Special Envoy for Technology, Government of Kenya, Dr. Ehud Gachugu, PHD, HSC, Deputy CEO & Global Director, Youth & Jobs, Kenya Private Sector Alliance, Phyllis Migwi, Country General Manager, Microsoft, Kenya, Ms. Caroline Njuki, Chief Technical Advisor, ILO, Kenya and Somanna Palacanda, International Field Director, Microsoft Elevate*",
