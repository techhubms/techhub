These updates were initially available for Xbox Insiders and starting in September, we’ll begin rolling these out to everyone.\n\nFirst up, the **ROG Xbox Ally,** which we previously [announced at Gamescom](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-october-features/), is now available for pre-order. Then, there’s **Gaming Copilot (Beta)**, your personal gaming sidekick is rolling out to our players on PC and mobile. We’re also revamping the Xbox PC app with a new My Library experience, where you’ll be able to install third-party apps in **My apps** and pull together all your games, even those from other PC storefronts, into one clean **aggregated gaming library** in My games. In addition, your game **play history**, including easier access to cloud-playable games, is now accessible across all your devices.\n\nAnd because we’re all about making gaming smoother and fun, we have updates coming for **social widgets**, a new **network quality indicator** to help you track your cloud gaming performance, and a more intuitive **rewards** interface accessible across devices including handhelds.\n\nFinally, in case you missed it, through our partnership with LG we are expanding the definition of what an Xbox is as you will soon be able to play games from the back seat of your car. Read about these and much more below.\n\n## **Here’s What’s New**\n\n**Get Ready to Play Anywhere – Pre-order ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally Now**\n\n![ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally Hero Asset](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/Xbox_Reship_KV_Dual_16x9-7bfe25e93daa7e73f5b8-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nWe’re excited to announce that players can now pre-order the ROG Xbox Ally X and ROG Xbox Ally, two powerful handhelds designed to take your game library with you wherever you go. These handhelds deliver an approachable, portable gaming experience, packed with several new and first-of-its kind features.\n\nLaunching globally on October 16, the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally offer two distinct options to match your personal playstyle. The Xbox Ally X is the ultimate high-performance handheld, built for the most demanding players. While the Xbox Ally is the essential handheld for everyone from the casual player to the avid enthusiast.\n\nPre-orders are available through the Microsoft Store, ASUS eShop, and local retailers. Once pre-orders go live in your region, head to https://www.xbox.com to find participating retailers and secure your device.

Whether you’re stuck on a boss fight or looking for your next favorite game, Gaming Copilot is ready to help with recommendations and insights when you want it.\n\nTo get started, make sure you have the Xbox PC app installed, press Windows + G, and launch Gaming Copilot from Game Bar. Learn more and get tips for getting started[here](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/18/gaming-copilot-xbox-pc-mobile/).\n\n**Seamlessly Access Your Gaming Library, Apps, and Play History in One Place**\n\n![Seamlessly Access Your Gaming Library Asset](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/2509AggLib-copy-edc0fcf84b8a1b7f4efb-1900x1082.jpg)\n\nNow all your apps and games are easier to find than ever under My Library. With My apps, you can now access your go-to third-party apps, such as browsers, storefronts, and gaming utilities, right from the Xbox PC app. No more digging around – everything’s in one place. Sort, scroll, and choose which apps you want to find and download on your home screen.\n\nAdditionally, bring everything together with an aggregated gaming library under My games. This collected gaming library pulls your games from Xbox, Game Pass, and your installed games from leading PC storefronts together. Now it’s easier to view and launch installed games from the most common gaming apps directly from My Library.\n\nAvailable now on Windows 11 PCs and handhelds, My apps and My games are built to support the new collective gaming library. That means faster access, smoother launches, and less time clicking around.\n\nPlayers can also now see all their cloud-playable games and game play history across devices. On console, check out the Play history tile on the Home page, and on the Xbox PC app, you can find your Play history tile in the Jump back in section of Home as well as the Play history tab in My Library.\n\nTo learn more, check out our previous [announcement](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/15/access-gaming-library-xbox-on-windows-pc-and-handheld/) describing these features. **[Back to top]**\n\n## **PC Gaming Updates**\n\n**Game Bar – Social Widgets and Visual Updates**\n\n![Social Overlay Asset](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/Overlay-Social-e8be293930d4e333210f-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nWe’ve wrapped up visual updates for Social widgets, and the result is a cleaner, more cohesive look across both Compact Mode and Desktop Mode. But it’s not just about looks, we’ve also made controller navigation smoother and more intuitive. Whether you’re chatting or checking activity, it’s now easier to get around with a controller. All of this adds up to a more polished, more enjoyable in-game overlay experience and better usability.\n\n**Network Quality Indicator Update**\n\n![Network Quality Indicator Update](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/09/Wire-Post-NQI-SoM-9176e255c3d3aa4d540f-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nWe’ve added a handy new feature to the Xbox PC app: a Network Quality Indicator (NQI) tool. Designed to help players better understand their network conditions, NQI offers clear guidance to troubleshoot the most common in-stream network issues that might mess with your cloud gaming experience. Since most audio/video issues come down to connection problems, this should make it easier to figure out what’s going on.\n\nYou can turn the network warning icons on or off by heading to your profile pic &gt; Settings &gt; Cloud Gaming &gt; Network Quality Indicator before you start streaming. If you want to change them while streaming, ​you can also enable this feature through Game Bar when playing a cloud game. Press Win+G, go to the Xbox Cloud Gaming widget, and then select Settings &gt; Enable Network quality indicator.

Now, when there’s a save that has not been synced from a previous session, on the next device you play on you’ll see a progress bar, device name, timestamp, and more details to help you understand what’s going on. We’ve also added insights into where the sync is coming from, how it’s progressing, and what to do if something gets stuck.
