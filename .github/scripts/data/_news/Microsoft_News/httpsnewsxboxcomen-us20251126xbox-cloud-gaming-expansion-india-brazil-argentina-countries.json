With more ways to play, thanks to Xbox Cloud Gaming, more people can jump in and play their favorite games, meaning more people to ready up with, throw down against, and build memories with.****\n\nPlayers are streaming their games more than ever — cloud gaming hours from Game Pass subscribers has increased 45% compared to this time last year. And, console players are embracing flexibility, spending 45% more time cloud streaming on console and 24% more on other devices.\n\nPeople play across the globe in many different ways and our ambition at Xbox is to reach players wherever they live and however they choose to play. Earlier this month, we expanded **Xbox Cloud Gaming to India,** the fastest-growing gaming market in the world, which surpassed 500 million gamers this year. With the addition of India, **Xbox Cloud Gaming is now available in 29 countries**. We’re also seeing exciting momentum in Latin America in countries like **Argentina and Brazil** which have shown double digital growth in play time and active players. Players in Argentina and Brazil can also now stream using the **Xbox app on LG TVs and Amazon Fire TV**, adding even more ways to play. To keep pace with this demand, we’ve expanded in-region server capacity, delivering shorter wait times for gamers. This expansion is all about meeting the community’s enthusiasm and making sure every session is instant and seamless.\n\n## **Xbox Cloud Gaming Brings Great Games to a Variety of Devices**\n\nWhat sets Xbox Cloud Gaming apart is the ability to quickly jump in and play great games on devices you already own, including consoles, PCs, handhelds, smartphones, tablets, Smart TVs, Fire TV, VR headsets like Meta Quest, and yes, even coming soon to cars! This fundamentally changes how and where players experience games, from action-packed adventures like *The Outer Worlds 2* to independent gems like *Ball x Pit* and *Blue Prince*.\n\nOur library keeps growing with hundreds of games ready to stream through Xbox Game Pass, plus over a thousand more in the [Stream your own game catalog](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/gallery/buy-and-stream), with new games being added all the time. Xbox Cloud Gaming allows players easy access to games they already own, with no downloads required, on any screen. And now, multiple [Xbox Game Pass plans](https://xbox.com/gamepass) include access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, offering more choice, flexibility, and ways to play.\n\nThis expansion reflects our commitment to making gaming more fun and accessible no matter how, where, or what you play – and this is just the beginning, with more great experiences and games to come across devices.",
