Learn more.\n\nEducators shape curriculum, advocate for students, innovate on the frontlines, and more—all at the same time. Students face their own balancing act as they’re asked to absorb knowledge, build confidence and find their voice, and prepare for an ever-evolving future. And often behind the scenes, staff and leaders work to align systems, respond to shifting demands, and chart the path forward for everyone to thrive.\n\nWhile over 80% of respondents in the [2025 AI in Education Report](https://aka.ms/AIinEDUReport) have already used AI for school, we believe there are significant opportunities to design AI that can better serve each of their needs and broaden access to the latest innovation.1\n\nThat’s why today, we’re **announcing AI-powered experiences built for teaching and learning** at no additional cost, new integrations in Microsoft 365 apps and Learning Management Systems, and **an academic offering for Microsoft 365 Copilot**.\n\n[Explore Microsoft 365 Copilot in education](https://www.microsoft.com/education/products/copilot-in-education)\n\n## Introducing AI-powered teaching and learning\n\n### Empowering educators with Teach\n\nWe’re introducing Teach to help streamline class prep and adapt AI to support educators’ teaching expertise with intuitive and customizable features. In one place, educators can easily access AI-powered teaching tools to **create lesson plans**, draft materials like **quizzes and rubrics**, and quickly **make modifications** to language, reading level, length, difficulty, alignment to **relevant standards**, and more.\n\nTeach is rolling out in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app starting today at **no additional cost for education customers** with more functionality, including Learning Management System (LMS) integration, coming soon. Many of these features are also available in the daily flow of educators using apps like Microsoft Teams and OneNote.\n\n[Try Teach with your school account](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/teach/)\n\n### Supporting students with Study and Learn Agent\n\nBy creating AI experiences grounded in learning science, we can more effectively support the process of learning for students and shift focus on the use of AI for quick content generation to nurturing the growth of skills over time. We’re bringing **Study and Learn**, an advanced agent, to students to provide adaptive experiences and help foster critical and reflective thinking. They can choose to work on their understanding, practice with exercises, study a specific topic, or simply chat and select from engaging built-in activities like flashcards, matching, fill-in-the-blank, or quizzes as they go. Study and Learn is coming to preview in November 2025 and will be available at no additional cost.\n\nLearn more about all the latest updates in today’s [Education Tech Community blog post](https://aka.ms/AIinEDU-OctoberBlog-TechCommunity).\n\n![The Study and Learn agent in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, showing prompts for understand, practice, and study.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/M365-Copilot-Study-and-Learn.webp)\n\n## New integrations in everyday apps for education\n\nMillions of educators, staff, and students ages 13 and older are using Copilot Chat to personalize learning, enhance instruction, and reimagine administrative tasks.

Plus, coming to preview in December 2025, it will be accessible in LMSs such as Canvas, Schoology, Brightspace, Blackboard, and Moodle™ through the Microsoft 365 LTI.\n\n[Try Copilot Chat today](https://m365copilot.com/)\n\n## Broadening access to the latest AI innovation\n\n![Academic offerings for Microsoft 365 Copilot, starting in December 2025.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Academic-offering-M365-Copilot.webp)\n\nWe’re excited to introduce an **academic offering for** [**Microsoft 365 Copilot**](https://www.microsoft.com/education/products/copilot-in-education) in education at $18 (USD) per user per month for educators, staff, and students ages 13 and older starting in December 2025.2 Deeply integrated into apps used every day, Microsoft 365 Copilot combines the power of AI with your data—documents, presentations, emails, meetings, chats, institutional knowledge, and more—plus the web to deliver relevant responses with sources.

Eighty-four percent of users—including **students**—at the [University of South Carolina](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/25399-university-of-south-carolina-microsoft-365-copilot#customers-share-modal-dialog) reported **saving between one and five hours per week**, with 8 in 10 users reporting satisfaction with Copilot. **Professors** reported **time savings** and improved **quality in academic output**, allowing more focus on higher-value research and mentoring. Meanwhile, administrators reported reduced meeting prep time and improved decision-making through faster data synthesis, and communication teams increased their creative output without sacrificing quality.\n\n## Transforming education experiences with agents\n\nInstitutions are deepening the use of AI to advance their mission and prepare students for the future while also beginning to demonstrate the potential of agents to transform experiences across teaching, learning, research, and operations. Whether you’re looking to use pre-built solutions, quickly build your own, or develop advanced systems, we’ve made it easy to take the power of generative AI a step further with agents. Simply use **natural language to create instructions** and select relevant content to begin transforming experiences and processes with customized agents.\n\nThe [University of South Florida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVXsm1yggMg) is driving a comprehensive approach across the spectrum of agents. The IT team has built agents to enhance campus experiences and support for topics like travel policy, the IT help desk, or events such as student commencement. They’ve worked with the library, athletics, **** and are partnering with **** the College of Medicine to create custom solutions including an advanced accreditation system and interactive student handbooks.\n\nStudent Ambassadors built agents for several departments resulting in **decreased manual reporting time**, expedited inventory analysis, and **improved content creation workflows**. Their Microsoft 365 Copilot users are also already seeing efficiency gains with Researcher and Analyst to support tasks like annual report development, procurement, billing evaluation, and budget reviews. Next, they’re piloting the use of autonomous agents to drive IT process automation and an agent-driven contact center.\n\nAt Broward County Public Schools, academic leaders are creating innovative agents such as an interactive quiz engine to enhance student engagement, a resume and job description analyzer to support career readiness initiatives. They’re also exploring agent use cases like professional development planning, recruitment assistance, newsletter and report drafting, and more. To streamline operations, Broward is building agents to facilitate contract management and improve access to support information for users of their Student Information System.\n\n## More ways to get started on your AI journey\n\nNo matter where you are on your AI journey, we offer a place to get started, including many options at no additional cost.
