They succeed because the reasoning layer is structured: • clear identity systems • consistent data flows • human-AI handoff points • governance built into the workflow\n\nAI becomes transformative only when the environment it enters is organized enough to absorb it.\n\nThis partnership shows the next phase of AI adoption: • Not “AI as a tool,” • Not “AI as automation,” • But AI as public infrastructure — shaping how people make decisions, move between jobs, and build long-term security.\n\nThe real breakthrough isn’t the model. It’s the system that lets 300M+ people benefit from it.\n\nAnd we’re just starting to see what happens when national-scale platforms are designed around structured cognition, not just technology.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply)\n\n1 Reaction\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/company/menttechlabs?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Ment Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/menttechlabs?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n1h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nAt Ment, we’re seeing the same thing in a smaller but very clear way: when AI is placed closer to where real decisions are made in policies or in everyday work its impact grows fast.\n\nOur focus is on building AI that makes things easier for people who usually aren’t part of formal digital systems.

It benefits greatly from azure’s cloud based security and privacy to process transactions at scale which would not have been possible. However the ai capabilities mostly revolve around live language translation in 22 languages. Its a good step forward but there is so much more potential to how they could use AI for more than just finding out what skills sets are required for future jobs( plumbers) etc to upskill. The ai resume builder , learning path from where you are to where you want to be etc. would be gamechangers. Would love to see more of these as services in azure as any government( national/ regional) would be able to reuse it.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [10 Reactions](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n11 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://www.linkedin.com/in/otina-e-b3a3331b2?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Otina E.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/otina-e-b3a3331b2?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n22m\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nIt's truly inspiring to see artificial intelligence being applied on such a large scale.

Technology must go beyond connecting workers. It should tackle systemic issues that block progress: ◉ Air and river pollution – Deploy AI-driven monitoring and enforcement systems for industrial discharge and urban emissions. And Implement #UGDMN ◉ Water stress – Use predictive analytics for groundwater management and optimize irrigation through smart sensors. ◉ Traffic gridlock – Implement AI-based traffic flow algorithms and real-time route optimization integrated with public transport. ◉ Scam centers – Strengthen cybersecurity frameworks and AI fraud detection to dismantle organized digital crime. ◉ Job quality – Focus on AI in manufacturing, logistics, and agri-tech to create skilled employment, not gig work. ◉ Inequality – Use AI for targeted education and healthcare delivery in rural zones to bridge gaps. ◉ Climate awareness – Build AI platforms that explain real climate drivers like solar cycles and cosmic influences, not narrow CO₂ narratives. ◉ Development – Align AI with infrastructure, energy, and transparent governance to push India toward developed status. #UGDMN: [totrade.co/o](http://totrade.co/o?trk=public_post_comment-text)\n\n- ![]()\n\nNo more previous content\n\n- ![]()\n\nNo more next content\n\n``\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [1 Reaction](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n2 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://in.linkedin.com/in/drashishjuneja?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Dr Ashish Juneja, PhD](https://in.linkedin.com/in/drashishjuneja?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n7h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nAccess + Skills + AI can transform a worker’s entire economic trajectory. One ID on e-Shram. One skills upgrade. One job platform.\n\nA worker earning ₹12,000 can suddenly earn ₹18,000–₹24,000.\n\nNot because opportunity didn’t exist… but because visibility, clarity and access didn’t. What struck me most in this story: A simple digital identity unlocked formal jobs AI tools helped workers build résumés, understand skills gaps, and prepare for interviews A worker earning from manual labour can now double income with data-entry skills Technology is not replacing them — it’s elevating them This is the next decade in India: Workers moving from invisible → visible. From informal → formal. From underpaid → upwardly mobile. AI won’t take their jobs. AI will take away their limitations. And the biggest lesson? Progress starts the moment you stop guessing your value and start upgrading it.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply) [1 Reaction](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reactions)\n\n2 Reactions\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://de.linkedin.com/in/catrin-heringer-b188b1359?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Catrin Heringer](https://de.linkedin.com/in/catrin-heringer-b188b1359?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\n8h\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_jobs-security-skills-how-indias-giant-activity-7404408432293969921-BJHX&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nImpressive to see AI creating such tangible impact in India.
