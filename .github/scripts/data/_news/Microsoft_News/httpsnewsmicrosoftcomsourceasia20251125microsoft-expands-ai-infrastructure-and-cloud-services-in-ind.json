The event featured **Mike Chan, General Manager, Microsoft Asia Azure AI Apps & Agents**, and **Dharma Simorangkir, President Director of Microsoft Indonesia**, alongside key customers and partners who are accelerating their innovation through Microsoft Cloud and AI.\n\n**Dharma Simorangkir**, **President Director, Microsoft Indonesia**, added: “With new Cloud and AI services now live in Indonesia Central, we are opening the door for every organization to innovate in Indonesia, for Indonesia. This is our call to action for businesses, developers, and public institutions — to leverage local infrastructure and build solutions that address Indonesia’s most important challenges and opportunities.”\n\n## **Building Apps That Matter: A Strategic Imperative for Frontier Firms**\n\nAs AI reshapes global competitiveness, leaders across industries are rethinking how they deliver impact, not just through adoption but also innovation. Microsoft refers to the most forward-thinking of these organizations as Frontier Firms: businesses that are not just experimenting with AI but rearchitecting how they operate by building apps and solutions that matter for their customers, employees, and communities.\n\nMicrosoft continues to enable these firms through its Cloud and AI services, powered by Azure, including:\n\n- **Azure App Services**, to build intelligent, data-connected applications faster;\n- **Azure Databases** to manage and secure business-critical data; and\n- **AI Infrastructure**, including NVadsA10\\_v5 and NCads\\_H100\\_v5-series virtual machines designed to handle advanced AI model training, inferencing, and high-performance computing workloads, which are now available locally through the Indonesia Central cloud region.\n\nThese capabilities are further strengthened by **Microsoft 365 Copilot**, also available locally through the Indonesia Central cloud region, which brings AI directly into everyday productivity flows; and **GitHub Copilot**, Microsoft’s global AI-powered tool that accelerates developer productivity and code generation.\n\nThese tools are not standalone – they form a unified platform to help organizations move from pilot to production, scale innovation, and achieve tangible business outcomes with speed and confidence. This is in line with recent announcements made at [Microsoft Ignite](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/18/from-idea-to-deployment-the-complete-lifecycle-of-ai-on-display-at-ignite-2025/), where responsible AI utilization means thinking about how it can be used most effectively at every layer, from the datacenter that powers AI functionality to the people and organizations that are benefiting from its capabilities.\n\n## **Growing Customer Momentum in Indonesia Central**\n\nSince its launch in May 2025, the Indonesia Central cloud region has continued to grow rapidly. Among the organizations onboarded across diverse industries are leading names such as Petrosea and Vale Indonesia, that are increasingly leveraging the region’s in-country infrastructure to modernize operations and strengthen data governance.\n\nOther Frontier-minded organizations include digital natives such as [tiket.com](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftiket.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cv-vandanato%40microsoft.com%7C0dcbba5cb2cc455db71808de2b721697%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638995966552515015%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=5HzryDVnVibf3iYyV3EmibO1IiN0yScMRxdcr60LGbc%3D&amp;reserved=0),  one of Indonesia’s leading travel technology platforms, are pushing the boundaries of customer experience through agentic AI. Its AI-based travel assistant, built in-house on the Azure OpenAI Service, allows customers to manage their trips using natural language, such as adding an add-on flight after booking, checking flight notifications, and refund, showcasing how human-AI collaboration is reshaping everyday services in Indonesia.“Our advancements in artificial intelligence are designed to deliver the best possible experience for our customers,” said **Irvan Bastian Arief, PhD, as the Vice President of Technology GRAND, Data & AI at**[**tiket.com**](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftiket.com%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cv-vandanato%40microsoft.com%7C0dcbba5cb2cc455db71808de2b721697%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638995966552534086%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=HSQXoTkp%2B1Vx%2F5YIfEHNsgpZNINbsd1RSIZduWuxRd8%3D&amp;reserved=0)**.**\n\n## **Microsoft Fabric: A Game Changer for AI and Data Analytics**\n\nThe Summit also spotlighted the general availability of Microsoft Fabric in Indonesia. Fabric is the unified, AI-powered data platform to simplify data management and analytics. The platform includes Data Lake, Data Engineering, Data Integration, Data Science, Data Warehousing, Real-time Intelligence, Business Intelligence, and Copilot built-in within Fabric that helps organizations connect, prepare their data to be ready with AI, and analyze data seamlessly across their business.\n\nWith Fabric, Indonesian enterprises can accelerate innovation and decision-making by bringing together disparate data sources into a single environment, improving agility, governance, and cost efficiency.

Through tools such as Microsoft Copilot, Learning Accelerator, Minecraft Education, and AI learning modules, participants are empowered to use AI to solve real problems in their communities, classrooms, and organizations.\n\n“Cloud and AI are no longer just technologies; they are the backbone of national competitiveness,” added **Dharma**. “Our focus is not only to provide infrastructure but also to ensure that Indonesians are equipped to lead in the AI era.”\n\n## **Looking Ahead: Building an Innovation Ecosystem Together**\n\nToday’s announcements further strengthen Microsoft’s long-term commitment of US$1.7 billion (2024–2028) to advance Indonesia’s cloud and AI infrastructure, ecosystem development, and skilling programs.\n\nAs part of this growing ecosystem, Microsoft will host the upcoming GitHub Universe Jakarta on 3 December 2025 — a developer-focused forum to accelerate AI innovation and open collaboration among Indonesia’s software and startup communities.
