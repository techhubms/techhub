That means every cloud-enabled title, from original Xbox classics to Xbox Series X|S exclusives, is now in one place whether you own it or play through Xbox Game Pass. It’s a simpler, more connected way to find and get into cloud gaming.\n\nThere are multiple entry points to continue playing your current games. On console, check out the Play history tile on the Home page, and on the Xbox PC app, you can find your Play history under the Most Recent section in the sidebar menu as well as the Play history tab in My Library.\n\n## **PC Gaming Updates**\n\n**Bring Everything Together with My apps – Available to Xbox Insiders**\n\n![Bring Everything Together with My Apps Screenshot](https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/08/ROG-1f6cdc2892a748180d70-1900x1080.jpg)\n\nWe’re continuing to evolve the Xbox on PC experience, and we’ve rolled out **My apps** to Xbox Insiders, a new tab in the Xbox PC app that makes it easier to get to the apps you use most.

We’ve added smart updates for controller and keyboard users that make navigation feel more intuitive and console-like: A to select, B to go back, Y to search. You’ll notice smoother trigger and bumper behavior, faster scrolling, and smarter focus memory between pages. Keyboard navigation also got a boost.\n\nVisually, things are cleaner. Focus indicators are clearer, animations are subtle but purposeful, and everything feels more polished.
