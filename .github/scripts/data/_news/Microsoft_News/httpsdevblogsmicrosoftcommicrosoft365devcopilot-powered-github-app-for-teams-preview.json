  "EnhancedContent": "Meet the reimagined GitHub app for Teams: an AI-powered app to collaborate with GitHub Copilot right inside your Teams conversations.\n\nThis initial release focuses on the Copilot coding agent, which was built to translate conversations into code and pull requests. This is the first step toward bringing the full power of GitHub into Teams.\n\nWith the new GitHub app for Teams, you can ship features faster, fix bugs, expand test coverage, and improve documentation—all through conversation, helping you move from “we should” to “it’s done.”\n\n[Watch the video on YouTube](http://youtube.com/watch?v=sXuiXpGWEXY)\n\n## How it works\n\nWorking with the GitHub app for Teams is like having an extra developer on your team who understands your codebase and works in your environment.\n\n**Task automation:** Assign tasks to the GitHub app as you would any developer on your team; it can open pull requests (PRs), write code, and request reviews. The app reduces manual overhead and keeps work moving forward without needing constant oversight.\n\n**Repo awareness:** The app analyzes your repository and uses code search to surface relevant files and past history. It also respects existing repository and organization policies, like branch protections, to ensure all work still goes through approved human review.\n\n**App integration:** Whether you’re using GitHub or Teams, the app operates inside the tools your team uses. No switching tabs or learning new interfaces—just seamless collaboration in your normal flow of work.\n\n[![github app for teams image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJPAQMAAADYDTRDAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAYUlEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAswEp3gABiVtJnAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2025/09/github-app-for-teams-2.png)\n\n## Example workflow\n\nYou can now complete the entire development lifecycle in Teams channels, from identifying the issue to delivering the fix.\n\n1. **Identify bug:** A support engineer shares a customer-reported bug in a Teams channel.\n2. **Begin investigation:** A developer picks up the issue, adds details from logs, and teammates discuss possible causes.\n3. **Determine action plan:** The team agrees on the best solution in the channel.\n4. **GitHub takes action:** A developer mentions @GitHub to make the fix. The app shows its progress as it works through the plan, step by step, until the changes are ready for review.\n5. **Resolve issue:** The bug is resolved, and everyone is updated in Teams.\n\nThe GitHub app for Teams allows your team to collaborate on code, start tasks, update pull requests, and follow progress in real time—all within Teams.\n\n## Setup and availability\n\n[Install GitHub app for Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/836ecc9e-6dca-4696-a2e9-15e252cd3f31)\n\n- After installation, connect your GitHub account, set your default repository, and then use **@GitHub** to generate pull requests and collaborate seamlessly with other users.\n- The app is still in preview. [We welcome your feedback](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations)!\n- The previous GitHub for Teams app is now [GitHub Notifications](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/wa200002077?tab=overview). It focuses on surfacing notifications such as issues, pull requests, and GitHub Actions workflows.\n\nHappy coding!",
