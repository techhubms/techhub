  "EnhancedContent": "There’s a reason event planners talk about adrenaline like it’s part of the job. One schedule change, one missed email, and one system that doesn’t sync—and everything starts to wobble. As the event industry evolves, the pressure only escalates. The event management software market size is projected to grow from USD 12.62 billion in 2025 to USD 46.99 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.04% during the forecast period.1 Behind those numbers: rising audience expectations, hybrid complexity, AI adoption, and organizations pushing for tighter integration between marketing, sales, and experience.\n\nHowever, most teams still operate in silos. CRMs hold registration data. Calendar invites go out manually. Streaming links live on one platform, analytics on another. Each system works—until it doesn’t. And when they don’t connect, the burden falls on people to make them fit.\n\nThat’s the problem InEvent and Microsoft set out to solve.\n\n[Discover Microsoft for Startups today](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups/)\n\n## **Closing the gap: From disconnected tools to a connected ecosystem**\n\nInEvent and Microsoft share a vision: technology should remove friction, not create more of it. Together, they’re building an event infrastructure where Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft Outlook, and AI tools like ChatGPT don’t just bolt on—they belong. Real-time updates flow automatically, systems talk to each other, and planners don’t have to manually sync five platforms just to keep an event on track.\n\n## **The solution: Technical integration that just works**\n\nBy connecting the tools event professionals already rely on—Teams, Dynamics 365, Outlook, and AI assistants like ChatGPT—InEvent and Microsoft are removing the friction between people and platforms.\n\n### **Infrastructure that scales**\n\nBuilt on Microsoft Azure, InEvent is available in the Azure Marketplace, making it easier for enterprise clients to deploy within trusted governance structures. All microservices run on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), allowing effortless scaling during peak event traffic. Servers are hosted entirely on Azure, delivering the performance, security, and uptime global events demand.\n\n### **Identity and security built for the enterprise**\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO) through Azure Active Directory lets organizers and attendees log in with existing credentials. For IT teams, this means easier provisioning and fewer security reviews. For attendees, it’s one less password to remember.\n\n### **A workflow that automatically updates itself**\n\nWith native integration into Outlook Calendar, RSVPs, invitations, and session updates are reflected in real time. Planners can adjust a session title or time slot inside InEvent, and it automatically updates across attendee calendars, internal schedules, and speaker notifications.\n\n### **CRM and data that feeds itself**\n\nThrough Dynamics 365, InEvent automatically pushes attendee data—registrations, behaviors, and interactions—straight into your pipeline. That means more relevant outreach, faster follow-up, and better return on investment (ROI) visibility for every stakeholder.\n\n### **AI and automation that delivers**\n\nUsing [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/), InEvent uses ChatGPT into every phase of the event cycle: drafting speaker bios, writing reminder emails, generating content suggestions, and segmenting audiences in real time. Planners spend less time staring at blank docs and more time designing experiences that connect.\n\n## **The power of partnership**\n\nAzure’s scalability, security, and interoperability aligned with InEvent’s vision for a connected ecosystem. [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups/) provided mentorship, go-to-market guidance, and Azure credits, powering AI-powered features like smarter registration flows and deeper personalization.\n\nMost importantly, enterprise clients already work in Teams, Outlook, and Dynamics 365 daily. By embedding InEvent directly into those environments, adoption is easy.\n\n## **The road ahead: Smarter events, powered by partnership**\n\nThe InEvent and Microsoft story is about building a foundation for what comes next. Smarter AI workflows are already reshaping event planning. Collaboration inside Teams will run deeper, and the line between “internal platform” and “event platform” will continue to blur.\n\nEvery check-in, poll response, and session interaction captured through Dynamics 365 becomes part of a bigger picture—one that doesn’t just measure event ROI, but forecasts pipeline impact and informs strategy for the year ahead.\n\nThrough all of this, one truth remains: this isn’t about replacing people with machines. It’s about giving event professionals back the one resource they can never get enough of—time. Time to walk the floor, connect with sponsors, catch details before they slip, and focus on the work that creates real, lasting impact. Technology is the tool; people will always be the magic.\n\n## **Learn more**\n\n[Book a walkthrough](https://inevent.com/en/book-a-call-with-me.php) and experience how InEvent and Microsoft work together for your event registration to reporting, in real time.\n\n[Get started with Microsoft for Startups today](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups/)\n\n1Event Management Software Market Overview, Roots Analysis. 2025.",
