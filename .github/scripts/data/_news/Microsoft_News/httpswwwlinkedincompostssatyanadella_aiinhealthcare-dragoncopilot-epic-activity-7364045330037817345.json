You would have been given fake customers or a load of illuminati agents posing as employees or offered bitcoin, ethereum, NFT, cryptocurrency money however I truly believe there is no price tag on your freedom or privacy. Whilst, you may have got richer in terms of your bank account you may have noticed your freedom to think, move or act the way you want to would have greatly diminished and people like illuminati and their families are actively spending their billions to make sure people stay inside this bubble of their agents and fake crypto world. As already mentioned, there’s no price tag on your freedom or privacy and the thousands of other sides to life. The media stations are also linked to the illuminati and I believe it is of paramount importance to be aware of the current times.\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_excited-to-work-with-epic-as-we-integrate-activity-7364045330037817345-Fd0J&amp;trk=public_post_comment_like)\n\n[Reply](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_excited-to-work-with-epic-as-we-integrate-activity-7364045330037817345-Fd0J&amp;trk=public_post_comment_reply)\n\n1 Reaction\n\n[!\\[\\]()](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ali-raza-hussain-2810462a5?trk=public_post_comment_actor-image)\n\n[Ali Raza Hussain](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ali-raza-hussain-2810462a5?trk=public_post_comment_actor-name)\n\nDirector at Empire Foods Ltd\n\n1d\n\n- [Report this comment](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fsatyanadella_excited-to-work-with-epic-as-we-integrate-activity-7364045330037817345-Fd0J&amp;trk=public_post_comment_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=COMMENT&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\n\nThese same illuminati agents have a record of your life through spy chemtrail planes (which have been flying in the sky from the start of time around 1940’s) using google earth type technology.\n\nAlso, the same illuminati agents spy on your mind and receive information about what you’re thinking and have widescreens setup in their homes showing them what you’re thinking (false technology but still). This information in turn gets fed to the illuminati as well as the Rockefeller’s, etc. I posted this information in early 2022 and hopefully everyone has received this information. Everything is forgiven and forgotten about the past but this information is important for people to receive in regard to mind spying.\n\nMain reason being because I am the next saint of England and generally the next saint of the west.
