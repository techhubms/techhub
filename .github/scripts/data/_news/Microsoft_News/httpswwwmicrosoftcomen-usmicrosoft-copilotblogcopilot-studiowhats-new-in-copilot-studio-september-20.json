  "EnhancedContent": "In this edition of our monthly roundup, we’re recapping new features released in Microsoft Copilot Studio in September 2025.\n\nIn this edition of our monthly roundup, we’re recapping the most exciting new features recently released in Microsoft Copilot Studio.\n\n[Try Copilot Studio today](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?sku=606b54a9-78d8-4298-ad8b-df6ef4481c80&amp;ru=https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com&amp;cmpid=copilotstudio-home-hero-sta-buildchatbots&amp;products=606b54a9-78d8-4298-ad8b-df6ef4481c80&amp;brandingId=28b276fb-d2a0-4379-a7c0-57dce33da0f9&amp;ali=1)\n\n## Build richer agent experiences in Copilot Studio\n\n### Automate UI tasks with computer use, now in public preview\n\n[Computer use in Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/computer-use) is now available in public preview for United States-based environments, giving agents the ability to operate apps and websites directly. Describe a task in natural language, and the agent completes it with a virtual mouse and keyboard—clicking, typing, and navigating user interfaces (UIs). This expands automation into areas where no API or Model Context Protocol (MCP) connection exists—such as data entry, reporting, or information gathering.\n\n![Testing: Register invoice dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250413-Computer-use-test-invoice-processing-2-3-1024x576.webp)\n\nThe public preview adds several key enhancements. A hosted browser powered by Windows 365 makes it simple to automate web tasks without configuring your own machine, while still supporting local software through registered devices. Templates help makers get started quickly with common workflows.\n\nIn addition, credential management allows agents to securely log into sites and apps during runs. While, allow-list controls give admins confidence that agents only interact with approved applications and domains. Together, these updates make computer use more secure, resilient, and accessible for enterprise scenarios.\n\nBecause computer use relies on built-in vision and reasoning, agents can adapt when interfaces change. This makes it easier to bring Copilot Studio agents into day-to-day processes where human-style navigation is required. [Learn more from the announcement blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/computer-use-is-now-in-public-preview-in-microsoft-copilot-studio/) and try computer use today in the Tools tab in Copilot Studio.\n\n### Engage customers on WhatsApp, now generally available\n\nWe’re excited to share that the WhatsApp channel for Microsoft Copilot Studio is now generally available. With more than 2.7 billion users worldwide, WhatsApp is the most widely used messaging platform. Now, makers can seamlessly bring their AI agents to where customers already are.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp.webp)\n\nCopilot Studio is the only enterprise-grade AI agent platform with native WhatsApp deployment. In just a few clicks, makers can launch agents that deliver rich, interactive experiences to customers on WhatsApp. Agents can authenticate users by phone number, exchange messages that include images or attachments, and follow the same compliance and governance frameworks that support Microsoft 365 and Power Platform, giving organizations peace of mind as they scale.\n\nThis capability opens the door for a wide range of scenarios, from customer support and order tracking to appointment scheduling and product recommendations. By meeting customers in a communication channel they already trust, organizations can reduce friction, accelerate time to market, and strengthen customer relationships.\n\nWith [WhatsApp now generally available](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/release-plan/2025wave1/microsoft-copilot-studio/deploy-copilots-whatsapp-azure-communications-service-chat-sms-channels), Copilot Studio helps ensure that organizations can expand their reach and create high-impact customer experiences at enterprise scale. Learn more.\n\n### Test and enrich prompts in the prompt builder\n\nNow in preview, makers can systematically test and improve Copilot Studio prompts with new **prompt evaluations** in the prompt builder. Instead of relying on ad hoc manual testing, you can build comprehensive test sets by uploading cases in bulk, generating them automatically, pulling them from real user activity, or writing them manually. Each evaluation can be customized to focus on what matters most for your use case—tone, clarity, keyword matches, or structured output compliance. Results include both high-level accuracy scores and detailed insights per case, giving makers faster iteration cycles and greater confidence that prompts will perform reliably in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe prompt builder also now supports **Power Fx formulas** directly inside prompts. This lets you enrich your prompts with dynamic inputs such as the current date, text formatting, calculations, or memory table lookups. By combining Power Fx with prompt testing, you can create more context-aware prompts while keeping the authoring experience simple and consistent across Copilot Studio.\n\nTogether, these updates reduce rework, shorten testing cycles, and make it easier to maintain reliable, high-quality prompts. Prompt Evaluations are available today in preview, and Power Fx support is enabled by default.\n\n### Use file groups as knowledge in Copilot Studio agents, now generally available\n\nNow **generally available**, makers can organize locally uploaded files into groups and use them as a single knowledge source in Copilot Studio agents. This update helps reduce clutter from long lists of individual files and provides a more structured way to guide agents toward accurate, context-rich responses.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2-file-grouping-900.webp)\n\nWith file groups, you can combine up to 25 groups per agent, covering as many as 12,000 files. You can also add variable-based instructions to fine-tune how knowledge is applied, giving you more control over which content the agent should prioritize in specific scenarios.\n\nFile groups can be created during upload or from existing files already added to an agent. Once grouped, the files are treated as one knowledge source. (Note: ungrouping is not yet supported so deleting a file group is required to make changes.)\n\nThis capability helps ensure that makers can better [organize and scale knowledge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/knowledge-file-groups) within their agents, while providing users with more relevant and precise answers.\n\n### Create reusable component collections\n\nManaging copilots across environments is simpler with the component collection capability, now generally available in Copilot Studio. Makers can package agent components, including topics, knowledge, actions, and entities, into collections that can be reused across agents or moved between environments to support application lifecycle management.\n\nTo make this process straightforward, you can create solutions to export and import agents and their components using the Copilot Studio Solution Explorer. By grouping everything into a solution, makers can move agents and components across environments in a cohesive, structured way. You can also reuse the agent components to augment other agents in the same environment.\n\nThese component collections help teams create a more predictable, consistent approach to managing changes and scaling agents across environments and make [creating or augmenting future agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-solutions-overview) faster than before.\n\n### Enable end users to upload files during agent interactions\n\nAgents built in Copilot Studio can now accept files from users and pass them into downstream systems through agent flows, Microsoft Power Automate, or connectors. This opens the door to richer scenarios where file inputs are central to the process, such as document summarization, data extraction, or validation workflows. Makers can now handle these processes without leaving the Copilot Studio experience.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Upload-a-file-attachment.webp)\n\nWith this update, agents can collect both the file and its metadata (including name, content type, and content) and hand it off for downstream processing. This helps streamline end-to-end processes while reducing the need for workarounds or manual steps.\n\nThis enhancement helps ensure that agents can better support real-world business processes, making Copilot Studio a more powerful tool for scenarios where files play a critical role. Learn more about the benefits of file upload for your agents’ users and get started today.\n\n## Extend and customize with advanced tools\n\n### Unlock advanced scenarios with code interpreter, now generally available\n\nCode interpreter is now generally available in Copilot Studio and Copilot Studio lite (formerly called the Microsoft 365 agent builder), bringing powerful new ways to generate and execute Python code directly within an agent. Makers can use natural language to create Python-based actions, edit the generated code, and save prompts for reuse. At runtime, the agent executes that same code, enabling richer outputs and new possibilities for customization.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/code-interpreter.webp)\n\nWith this general availability release, the prompt builder now supports create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on Dataverse tables. That means makers can use natural language prompts to perform these actions without leaving Copilot Studio. Furthermore, agents can dynamically generate visualizations and extend their responses, improving efficiency and quality of consistent reusable logic.\n\nEnabling code interpreter is simple and can be done in two ways. Turning it on at the agent level means that every prompt and action within that agent can execute Python. This is ideal for scenarios that require consistent logic across conversations. The other option is enabling code interpreter in the prompt builder (inside your Tools tab) within an agent, which is more lightweight and specific. This is useful for testing or using one-off prompts without impacting the entire agent.\n\nGet started using [code interpreter](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/code-interpreter-for-prompts?branch=pr-en-us-961) to generate and execute Python code today.\n\n### Integrate Copilot agents into native apps with the Agents Client SDK\n\nThe new **Agents Client SDK** makes it easy for developers to embed Copilot Studio agents directly into their Android, iOS, and Windows applications. With this integration, end users can interact with agents inside the apps they already use, starting with multimodal conversations through text and adaptive cards. Support for additional modalities, including voice, image, video, and context sharing, are on their way.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Agents-Client-SDK.webp)\n\nWith the SDK, developers can seamlessly extend agents into mobile and desktop environments, enabling richer conversational experiences and unlocking new workflows where customers are most engaged. This creates opportunities to add agent-driven intelligence directly into day-to-day applications, without requiring users to switch contexts.\n\nPlatform-specific documentation and packages are also available for [Windows](https://aka.ms/AgentsClientSDK-Windows), [iOS](https://aka.ms/AgentsClientSDK-iOS), and [Android](https://aka.ms/AgentsClientSDK-Android). The [Agents Client SDKs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/publication-communicate-with-agent-from-native-app) for text and adaptive card conversations are generally available now.\n\n### Create MCP connectors directly in Copilot Studio\n\nYou can now connect MCP servers to Copilot Studio with just a few clicks. This feature, now in public preview, makes it easier than ever to extend your agents by bringing in MCP connectors without the need for manual setup or custom development.\n\nMakers can simply provide an MCP host URL and Copilot Studio will handle the rest. Within minutes, your MCP servers can be connected and ready to power agent experiences—helping expand the reach of your agents while reducing setup time and complexity.\n\nThis update also introduces **support for MCP resources**, such as files and images. As the MCP ecosystem continues to evolve, resource support expands the kinds of data and interactions you can bring into your agents, helping you design richer and more flexible experiences.\n\nBy making MCP integration simpler and adding resource support, Copilot Studio helps ensure that makers can focus on building impactful agent experiences while seamlessly tapping into the growing power of the MCP ecosystem.\n\nThese capabilities are on by default, so you can start using them right away to [extend your agents with MCP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/agent-extend-action-mcp).\n\n## Manage and measure agents at scale\n\n### Manage new agents with a dedicated environment in Copilot Studio lite\n\nWe’re making it easier to manage agents with the introduction of a dedicated environment for Copilot Studio lite (formerly called the agent builder). Each agent built in the lite version now runs in the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat environment, which acts as a digital workspace for managing users, permissions, and creations.\n\nThis dedicated environment provides two key benefits. First, it maps the geography where data is stored at the time the agent is created, giving organizations clarity and control over data residency. Second, it surfaces optional admin-level information around billing and consumption. If your organization has enabled billing for Microsoft 365 Copilot, admins can check message usage directly in the Environments tab, making it simpler to track capacity and stay ahead of demand.\n\nFor makers, nothing changes and you can continue creating agents without extra steps. Copilot Studio lite checks for and creates the environment automatically if one does not already exist. The result is a smoother authoring experience for makers and clearer administrative oversight for admins; all aligned with how your organization already manages Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\nThis update helps ensure that both makers and admins have the transparency and control they need to build, deploy, and scale agents with confidence.\n\n### Analyze agent performance and measure impact with new metrics\n\nSeveral new analytics capabilities in Copilot Studio give makers and admins deeper visibility into how agents are used, how effective they are, and the value they deliver.\n\n### Themes for generative AI questions in public preview\n\nThis feature looks at generative AI questions from the previous week and groups them into suggested themes. The themes show what types of questions customers are asking most and provide a detailed analysis of how well the agent responded. This helps makers quickly identify gaps in coverage and focus improvements where they matter most. This feature is in preview for all customers using generative answers for agents meeting the minimum threshold of 50 weekly questions.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Analytics_-Themes.webp)\n\n### Insights for unanswered generative AI questions in public preview\n\nCopilot Studio now surfaces themes for unanswered generative AI questions directly in the Analytics dashboard. Makers can quickly spot patterns in what users are asking but not getting answers for, helping them prioritize knowledge updates and reduce coverage gaps with less manual review.\n\n### Agent monthly consumption limits (general availability)\n\nAnalytics now display each agent’s monthly Copilot credits limit (as set in the [Power Platform admin center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-copilot-studio-messages-capacity?tabs=new)) alongside month-to-date usage. Makers no longer need to switch tools to monitor consumption and can act earlier if an agent is trending toward its limit.\n\n### Active users metric (general availability)\n\nA new view provides visibility into the unique users interacting with an agent. Custom reports include data on daily active users, trend lines over time, and monthly active users. This metric helps teams understand engagement patterns beyond session counts. This data is generally available for agents that are configured for authenticated users.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Analytics_Active-users.webp)\n\n### ROI analysis for agent runs (general availability)\n\nMakers can now define and track savings for autonomous agent runs segmented by time, money, or both. These can be tracked at either the run or tool level. Results are calculated automatically for the selected analytics period, with settings applied retroactively to past runs. This makes it simple to measure ROI in real time and guide investment decisions with data.\n\nThese various enhancements expand the analytics toolkit, helping teams measure adoption, spot performance issues, and quantify the business value of their Copilot Studio agents. Learn more about [analyzing conversational agent effectiveness](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/analytics-improve-agent-effectiveness).\n\n## Upskill with agents\n\n### Build your skills with Copilot Studio Agent Academy\n\nWe’re excited to introduce Copilot Studio Agent Academy: a free, self-paced curriculum designed to help makers and developers build real, useful agents with Microsoft Copilot Studio.\n\nThe curriculum is structured into three progressive levels: Recruit (available now), Operative (coming soon), and Commander (coming early next year).
