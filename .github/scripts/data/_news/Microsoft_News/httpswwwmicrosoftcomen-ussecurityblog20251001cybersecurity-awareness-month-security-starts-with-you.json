  "EnhancedContent": "At Microsoft, security is our number one priority, and we believe that cybersecurity is as much about people as it is about technology. As we move into October and kick off Cybersecurity Awareness Month, this time of year really makes me think about how important online safety is—not just at work, but for my family and friends too. I often find myself [sharing tips with loved ones](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cybersecurity-awareness) on how to stay safe online, because building strong security habits and keeping them top of mind has become a key part of how I protect myself and those around me.\n\n[Explore Microsoft Cybersecurity Awareness resources](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cybersecurity-awareness)\n\nAs part of the Microsoft [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative) (SFI), we have committed to embed security into every layer of our technology, culture, and governance—placing security above all else. Since its launch in November 2023, SFI has mobilized the equivalent of more than 34,000 engineers to proactively reduce risk and strengthen security across Microsoft and the products and services we offer our customers. A great example of this is mitigating advanced multifactor authentication attacks, where phishing-resistant [multifactor authentication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-mfa-multi-factor-authentication) now protects 100% of production system accounts and 92% of employee productivity accounts. In addition, we continue to reduce the risk of compromise during new employee setup by enforcing video-based verification, now at 99%.1\n\n## **Enabling your security-first approach**\n\nThis year, we have also developed new resources and tools to support security professionals in keeping their organizations secure, particularly as we enter this next era of AI. Building upon our learnings with SFI, we have created [SFI patterns and practices](https://aka.ms/SFI_PatternsAndPracticesPage), which is a new library of actionable guidance designed to help organizations implement security at scale.\n\nIn addition to best practices for security professionals, we continue to add articles to our [Be Cybersmart Kit](https://aka.ms/becybersmartkit), which is a great starting point for security professionals that need to educate their organizations on how to be safe. The Be Cybersmart Kit contains articles on AI safety, device security, domain impersonation, fraud, secure sign-in, and phishing. The kit is just one of the many resources available on the [Microsoft Cybersecurity Awareness site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cybersecurity-awareness).\n\n## Be Cybersmart\n\nHelp educate everyone in your organization with cybersecurity awareness resources and training curated by the security experts at Microsoft.\n\n[Get the Be Cybersmart Kit.](https://aka.ms/becybersmartkit)\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture3.jpg)\n\nThose seeking more in-depth resources can access expert-level learning paths, certifications, and technical documentation to continue their [cybersecurity education](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/yrrbdgy2d6158?source=docs&amp;culture=en-us&amp;country=us). And for students pursuing the field of cybersecurity, the [Microsoft Cybersecurity Scholarship Program](https://www.lastmile-ed.org/microsoftcybersecurityscholarship) and educational opportunities like [Microsoft Elevate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/elevate?msockid=208b42a480e96985268d5613815368fe) are here to help. The goal of all these programs is to help foster a culture that puts security and continuous learning first for students and professionals alike.\n\n## **Security-first in action: Franciscan Alliance**\n\nA great example of a security-first culture, especially around education and awareness training, is Franciscan Alliance, a non-profit Catholic health care organization based in Indiana. Franciscan Alliance employs a proactive and interactive strategy for cybersecurity awareness and employee education.\n\n> >\n> “We believe cybersecurity education should be continuous, engaging, and empowering—because informed employees are our strongest defense.”\n> >\n> —Jay Bhat, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Franciscan Alliance\n> >\n\nThe organization conducts monthly phishing simulations and quarterly assessments to expose staff to realistic scenarios consistently. Employees who do not pass the quarterly assessments are provided with additional training rather than being penalized, which supports a culture centered on learning and development. Training programs incorporate gamification elements to enhance accessibility and retention. Additionally, employees receive a monthly newsletter covering relevant security topics that support safe practices both professionally and personally.\n\nDuring Cybersecurity Awareness Month, weekly editions are distributed, along with timely updates on emerging threats, including breaches and attacks. Franciscan Alliance also organizes threat briefings in partnership with external partners and utilizes resources such as [Microsoft’s Cybersecurity Awareness](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cybersecurity-awareness) materials to inform its training initiatives.\n\n## **Developing security competencies in the age of AI**\n\nAs organizations rapidly embrace AI, making security the first priority is not just a best practice—it’s a necessity. AI systems are powerful tools that can transform business productivity, but without robust governance and security measures, they can also introduce significant risks. To address these challenges and empower security-first leadership, we invite C-level executives to register for Microsoft’s upcoming webinar “[Trust in AI: Accelerate Business Growth with Confidence](https://aka.ms/Trust-Webinar),” which will feature critical discussions on how to build trust in AI for your organization.\n\n**Get started here:**\n\n- Explore the [Cybersecurity Awareness Website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cybersecurity-awareness?msockid=208b42a480e96985268d5613815368fe#x12981407d7764b77b14d31c80686ca9c).\n- Download the [Be Cybersmart Kit](https://aka.ms/becybersmartkit) and share it with your teams.\n- Explore [SFI patterns and practices](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/08/06/sharing-practical-guidance-launching-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-sfi-patterns-and-practices/)for actionable security guidance\n- [Learn ways](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-security-blog/celebrating-cybersecurity-awareness-month-everyday-protection-with-microsoft-365/4453120) to keep your personal devices and data safer online with Microsoft 365.\n- Sign up for the [AI Skills Navigator program](https://aiskillsnavigator.microsoft.com/) that provides AI learning path trainings.\n- College students can apply for the [Microsoft Cybersecurity Scholarship Program](https://www.lastmile-ed.org/microsoftcybersecurityscholarship).\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft’s Chief Product Officer of Responsible AI Sarah Bird will moderate the panel, “[Cyber and AI, Strategic Risk and Competitive Advantage](https://cvent.me/7vZalR),” at the NASDAQ Summit on October 21, 2025, at the New York Stock Exchange, where industry experts will provide guidance on governance and security for AI. In this session, experts will discuss real-world use cases, regulatory developments, and the strategic implications of integrating AI into enterprise environments. Events such as these are incredible opportunities for executives to deepen their understanding and lead with confidence in the age of AI.\n\n![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Security_1084857_Blog_250929.webp)\n\n[Get the Be Cybersmart Kit](https://aka.ms/becybersmartkit)\n\n## **Make the most out of Cybersecurity Awareness Month**\n\nWe hope that these resources provide you with the learning, training, and confidence to set you and your organizations up for success—both this month and beyond. Now is the time to build a culture with a security-first mindset by making security part of your daily habits at work, home, and everywhere else. A security-first mindset means staying informed, proactively protecting digital assets, and encouraging others to do the same. Security is a team sport. By promoting vigilance and shared responsibility, we can create a safer world for all.\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Security solutions, visit our [website.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business) Bookmark the [Security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/) to keep up with our expert coverage on security matters.
