  "EnhancedContent": "[Podman](https://podman.io/) is an open-source container engine that has rapidly gained popularity for its daemonless architecture, rootless operation, and compatibility with Docker CLI commands. Unlike Docker, Podman does not require a central daemon, offering improved security and flexibility – especially in enterprise and cloud-native environments. Its ability to run containers without elevated privileges makes it an attractive choice for developers focused on security and compliance.\n\n# Podman Integration\n\nThe integration of Podman in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders is a game-changer for developers who prefer or require Podman for their workflows. Previously, container tooling in Visual Studio was largely centered around Docker. Now, with Podman support, users can choose the container engine that best fits their needs without sacrificing the productivity and convenience Visual Studio provides.\n\n[![podman desktop image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAK4AQMAAADQmh3iAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAbUlEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7wZexwABVvl3dAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/podman_desktop.png)\n\nDevelopers can now seamlessly create, run, debug, and manage containerized applications using Podman directly from the Visual Studio interface. This includes features such as image management and integrated terminal support for Podman commands. The experience is designed to be familiar for those accustomed to Docker, but with the added benefits unique to Podman.\n\n[![podman CTW image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAH7AQMAAABovn+9AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAVklEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADgb/3sAAaDuZgsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/podman_CTW.png)\n\n# Getting Started with Podman in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders\n\nTo begin, make sure you have the latest version of [Visual Studio 2026 Insiders](http://aka.ms/vs/insiders) and [Podman desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/) installed and configured.\n\nOnce Podman is set up, Visual Studio will automatically detect your containers and allow you to interact with them through the Solution Explorer, integrated terminal, and debugging tools. You’ll be able to build images, run containers, and monitor logs all within the familiar Visual Studio environment. If you have both Docker and Podman installed, you’ll need to set your preferred container runtime via **Tools** &gt; **Options** &gt; **Container Tools** &gt; **General** &gt; **Container Runtime** and select Podman from the dropdown menu.\n\n# Looking Forward\n\nThe addition of Podman support in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders signifies Microsoft’s commitment to supporting open-source technologies and empowering developers to choose the tools that best fit their workflows. As containerization continues to be a central pillar of modern software development, this release ensures Visual Studio remains a versatile and future-ready IDE.\n\nIf you’re eager to experiment with Podman or are already leveraging its capabilities, the latest Visual Studio Insiders release is a must-try. Download it today and experience a new level of flexibility in container development and let us know how it’s working for you in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/DockerTools/issues/459)."
