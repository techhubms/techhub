  "EnhancedContent": "**December 10, 2025** **8 am – 10 am Pacific** **Registration:** [https://aka.ms/OSSAISummitRegistration](https://aka.ms/OSSAISummitRegistration)\n\n![Building with LangChain banner](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-20415-1.webp)\n\n## **Overview**\n\nAI development is moving at a pace that leaves most teams reacting instead of leading. The next generation of applications will be built by people who understand how to design agents, coordinate tools, and create workflows that can handle real complexity. The OSS AI Summit is designed to help you get ahead of that shift. This event focuses on LangChain v1, Microsoft Foundry, and the systems that make modern AI applications reliable, scalable, and practical to ship. If you want to build smarter agents and understand the patterns that matter for 2026 and beyond, this is where you start.\n\nThe summit brings together experts from LangChain and Microsoft to break down the techniques that successful teams are using right now. You will see how developers structure components, connect agents to real systems, and use cloud scale infrastructure to avoid the bottlenecks that slow most projects.\n\n## **What the Event Covers**\n\n- **LangChain v1 Explained: Agents, Tools, and Beyond**\n\nA clear tour of LangChain components and how they fit together for both Python and JavaScript. If you have been guessing how to wire agents and tools, this session gives you a solid mental model.\n\n- **Fireside Chat: Agents in the Real World**\n\nEngineers and business leaders share how they use agents in production, what worked, what failed, and what they would change if they were starting again.\n\n- **Python Agents in Action: Building Agents that can Analyze Data**\n\nYou’ll see a sales analysis agent that uses LangChain and the OpenAI responses API to help analyze sales data in a PostgreSQL database.\n\n- **MCP in Action: Powering Single and Multi-Agent Systems with LangChain.js**\n\nYou’ll see how MCP gives agents controlled access to external systems and data, and how to build both single and multi-agent workflows with LangChain.js.\n\n- **Inside LangChain: Live Q&A with the Team**\n\nDirect questions to the people building the framework to get clarity on best practices and future direction.\n\n## **Projects You Can Explore Before the Event**\n\n### **AI Sales Analyst**\n\nThis project demonstrates a sales analyst chatbot for a fictional DIY store chain called Zava, built with LangChain, Azure OpenAI and Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Python. The agent can query a PostgreSQL database containing a product catalog, customer, and sales data across stores, while also leveraging OpenAI’s Responses API tools like web search, image generation, and code interpreter.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/langchain-agent-python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/langchain-agent-python)\n\n### **AI Travel Agents**\n\nThis reference application simulates a travel agency powered by multiple AI agents. It uses LangChain.js to coordinate agents that understand customer requests, recommend destinations, and build full itineraries. Multiple MCP servers written in Python, Node.js (TypeScript), Java, and .NET provide tools and services to the agents, all containerized and deployed on Azure Container Apps with monitoring and OpenTelemetry integration.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ai-travel-agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ai-travel-agents)\n\n### **MCP Agent with LangChain.js**\n\nThis sample shows a full AI agent experience that can order burgers through a real API using MCP tools. It includes a chat interface, serverless APIs, a burger ordering backend, and an MCP server that exposes those APIs as tools for the agent. It runs on Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions with Azure Cosmos DB for storage. It uses LangChain.js for reasoning and tool calling in a fully serverless infrastructure.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-agent-langchainjs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-agent-langchainjs)\n\n## **Why Attend?**\n\nIf you plan to ship AI features in the coming year, you need strong patterns, clean workflows, and a solid understanding of agent orchestration. The OSS AI Summit gives you an opportunity to ask questions and interact with summit speakers and panel of experts, get practical guidance, concrete examples, and direct access to the people shaping these tools.\n\n[📅Register to attend](https://aka.ms/OSSAISummitRegistration)\n\nRegister to attend at [https://aka.ms/OSSAISummitRegistration](https://aka.ms/OSSAISummitRegistration.) and we’ll see you on December 10th at 8 am Pacific!",
