This ecosystem includes communication and collaboration solution providers that compete with Microsoft Teams. Alongside these resources, we have also offered data portability solutions to our customers to allow them to move between services as they see fit.\n\nMicrosoft’s recent agreement with the European Commission formalizes these values into legal commitments. To meet these commitments and help developers and customers make more effective use of the tools we offer, we are now bringing these resources together into a [centralized developer resource page](https://aka.ms/TeamsCompliancePortal) that consolidates interoperability and data portability resources and provides ways for software development companies to provide feedback and request support. You can visit the new resource site now. To learn more about Microsoft’s Commitments to the European Commission, read the [September 12 announcement](https://aka.ms/TeamsCommitments/m365blog).",
