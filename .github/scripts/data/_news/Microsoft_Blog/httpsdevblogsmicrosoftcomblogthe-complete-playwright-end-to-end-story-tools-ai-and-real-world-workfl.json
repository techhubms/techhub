  "EnhancedContent": "## 1. Introduction\n\nEnd-to-end testing has evolved dramatically, and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) stands at the forefront. Playwright offers a full ecosystem empowering developers to write, debug, and maintain tests with speed and reliability.\n\nFrom its powerful [test runner](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-intro) to rich developer tools like the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright), [Codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen), [UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui), and [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer), Playwright covers every phase of your testing journey. With the recent integration of **Playwright MCP** and the Playwright MCP server included in **GitHub Copilot‚Äôs CodingAgent**, AI-assisted development is now a reality, supercharging productivity and enabling smarter workflows.\n\nThis post walks you through the Playwright story: setting up tests, leveraging developer tools for code generation and debugging, and tapping into AI-powered automation.\n\n**üöÄ New: Azure App Testing with Playwright**\n\nPlaywright is built into Azure App Testing, a unified functional and performance testing service. It provides scalable, cloud-parallel test execution and CI-connected validation to speed up feedback. [Learn more about Azure App Testing](https://aka.ms/azureapptesting/announcement).\n\n## 2. Getting Started with Playwright\n\nPlaywright supports TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, Python, and .NET. This post uses TypeScript snippets, but check the docs for other languages.\n\nTo install Playwright:\n\n``` npm init playwright@latest\n\n```\n\nThis sets up browser binaries, a basic test suite, and a Playwright config file.\n\nYour first test might look like this:\n\n``` import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest('homepage has title and links', async ({ page }) => { // Navigate to the website await page.goto('https://example.com');\n\n// Verify the title await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Example/);\n\n// Click a link and verify navigation await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'More information' }).click(); await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*more-info/); });\n\n```\n\nRun your tests with:\n\n``` npx playwright test\n\n```\n\nOr run a specific test file:\n\n``` npx playwright test homepage.spec.ts\n\n```\n\nInstall the [Playwright for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)(1.6 million downloads) for:\n\n- Visual **Test Explorer** to run and filter tests\n- Inline test results and error messages\n- One-click access to **Trace Viewer**\n- Record tests using **Codegen**\n- ‚ÄúFix with AI‚Äù button for AI-assisted test fixes\n\n![vs code extension for playwright](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/vs-code-extension.png)\n\nWith the extension, Playwright becomes a first-class citizen in your editor, making test authoring fast, fluid, and fun.\n\n## 3. Test Authoring Made Easy: Codegen and UI Mode\n\nWriting tests by hand can be tedious, especially when choosing selectors or remembering every interaction. Playwright makes this easier with **Codegen**.\n\n### Codegen: Record While You Interact\n\nUse `npx playwright codegen` to open your app and auto-generate test code as you click around.\n\n``` npx playwright codegen https://your-app.com\n\n```\n\nOr use the **Record New** button in the VS Code testing sidebar.\n\nThis outputs functional test code in real time. [Learn more about Codegen](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen).\n\n![Codegen in action](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/playwright-codegen.png)\n\n### UI Mode: Visual Test Exploration\n\nRun Playwright in interactive mode:\n\n``` npx playwright test --ui\n\n```\n\nThis launches a visual interface to:\n\n- Browse and run tests with a click\n- Instantly rerun tests in watch mode\n- Filter tests by status, tags, or file\n- Select locators directly from the UI\n- Inspect each test step, including console output, errors, and network requests\n- Examine DOM snapshots for visual debugging\n\nUI Mode lets you explore, run, and debug tests with a time-travel experience. See [UI Mode documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui).\n\n![UI Mode in action](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/playwright-ui-mode.png)\n\n*Together, Codegen and UI Mode make writing and running tests fast, visual, and intuitive.*\n\n## 4. Reporting and Observability: HTML Report\n\nPlaywright‚Äôs HTML Report provides an interactive overview of each test run:\n\n- Pass/fail status for every test\n- Execution time for each test and suite\n- Detailed error messages and stack traces\n- Network requests and console logs\n- Step-by-step breakdown of each test\n- Direct links to trace files\n\nGenerate a HTML report by default with this configuration in your `playwright.config.ts` :\n\n``` export default defineConfig({ reporter: [ ['html'], ['list'] // Also outputs results to the console ], // ...other config });\n\n```\n\nView the report after test execution:\n\n``` npx playwright show-report\n\n```\n\n![HTML Report in action](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/playwright-html-report.png)\n\nFiltering, grouping, and search make it easy to pinpoint issues and understand your test suite‚Äôs health.\n\n## 5. Debugging and Observability: Trace Viewer\n\nFlaky or failing tests are inevitable, but reproducing them doesn‚Äôt have to be hard. Playwright gives you first-class observability tools, especially the [Trace Viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer).\n\n### What Is a Trace?\n\nA **trace** is a full recording of a test run‚Äîevery click, network request, and DOM snapshot. You can explore traces interactively to understand what happened before, during, and after a failure.\n\nEnable tracing in your config:\n\n``` use: { trace: 'on-first-retry', // Record traces only when retrying a test // Alternative options: // 'on' - Record traces for all tests // 'off' - Don't record traces // 'retain-on-failure' - Record traces and only keep for failures }\n\n```\n\nAfter a test failure, launch the trace viewer:\n\n``` npx playwright show-trace trace.zip\n\n```\n\n![Trace Viewer in action](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/playwright-trace-viewer.png)\n\nYou‚Äôll see a timeline of actions, network activity, console logs, and more similar to what we saw in UI mode.\n\n### Traces on CI: No More ‚ÄúWorks on My Machine‚Äù\n\nTraces integrate seamlessly into CI:\n\n- Failed tests generate a trace on the first retry\n- Traces are saved as zip files and attached to CI artifacts\n- Download and inspect them locally\n\nThis means even on headless CI runs, you get a visual record. Debugging regressions becomes fast and collaborative. [Learn more in the CI traces guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-traces). For cloud-scale parallel execution and CI-connected validation, check out [Azure App Testing](https://aka.ms/azureapptesting/announcement).\n\n*Traces make every test explain itself, locally or in CI. You get a story, not just a stack trace.*\n\n### Copy as Prompt: AI Debugging\n\nWhen you encounter a failure, use **Copy as Prompt** in the HTML Report, Trace Viewer, or UI Mode to generate a prompt for AI debugging. Share the context with AI tools like GitHub Copilot or other assistants.\n\nCheck out this video to learn more on [debugging with AI using Playwright](https://youtu.be/Ec_3h5Q8RHY).\n\n## 6. AI Native Testing with Playwright MCP\n\n### Playwright MCP: A Server for AI Browser Automation\n\n[Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://playwright.dev/docs/mcp-intro) bridges AI agents and live browser sessions, letting AI interact with web apps via Playwright.\n\nPlaywright MCP empowers AI agents with:\n\n- - **Complete browser state:** Current page and accessibility tree\n\n- **Full suite of interaction tools:** Click, type, wait, etc.\n- **Real-time page snapshots:** Request current state anytime\n\n![Playwright MCP in action](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/playwright-mcp-vscode.jpg)\n\nCheck out this video to easily install and run Playwright MCP: [Playwright MCP in VS Code](https://youtu.be/exsikHe20D8).\n\n#### Use Cases for Playwright MCP\n\nPlaywright MCP unlocks intelligent agent behaviors:\n\n- Automated test execution and exploration.

GitHub Copilot‚Äôs Coding Agent: Powered by\nPlaywright MCP\n\nGitHub‚Äôs [Copilot Coding Agent](https://github.com/github/copilot-coding-assistant) has Playwright MCP built in, enabling real-time app interaction. When you ask Copilot‚Äôs agent to implement a feature or fix a bug, it uses Playwright MCP to open the browser, navigate to the app, and verify the change.\n\n### Self-Verifying AI Workflows\n\nWith Playwright MCP, Copilot‚Äôs agent can:\n\n- Launch a browser and load your app locally\n- Interact with the UI it just modified\n- Visually confirm the intended effect\n- Use page state and logs to catch regressions\n\nThis creates a closed loop:\n\n*Prompt ‚Üí Generate code ‚Üí Run and observe app ‚Üí Confirm success ‚Üí Report back*\n\n### No Extra Setup Needed\n\nNo configuration required. Assign an issue to Copilot Coding Agent, and it uses Playwright MCP to verify its work in a real browser.\n\nCheck out this video to see Copilot Coding Agent in action: [GitHub Copilot Coding Agent with Playwright MCP](https://youtu.be/NnRwjGMHsl8).\n\n*With Playwright MCP, Copilot Coding Agent doesn‚Äôt just write code‚Äîit checks its work in real time.*\n\n## 8.
