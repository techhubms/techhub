And recently, I stumbled on something that felt a bit like discovering an old Swiss army knife I forgot I had. It‚Äôs built into Outlook.com (and works with @outlook.com, @live.com, and even old @hotmail.com addresses). I actually learned from it by someone using GMail (where it worked first üôÇ )\n\nYou can use the ‚Äúplus alias‚Äù trick to make your email address behave in a much smarter way‚Äîwithout setting up multiple accounts.\n\n#### How it works\n\nSay your regular email is:\n\n`rene@live.com`\n\nYou can now use:\n\n- `rene+spam@live.com`\n- `rene+shops@live.com`\n- `rene+newsletters@live.com`\n\nThey will all still land in your `rene@live.com` inbox. But to whoever is sending them, they look like different addresses.\n\nThis is built-in behavior. No settings, no hacks. Just works.\n\n#### Why this is actually useful\n\nAt first, this sounds a bit like a gimmick. But once I started using it, I realized how practical it is:\n\n- **Filtering spam**: You can create a rule that says: if the email was sent to `rene+spam@live.com`\n, just throw it straight into the bin. No mercy.\n- **Tracking signups**: I once signed up to a service using `rene+storeX@live.com`\n. A few months later I started getting marketing emails from companies I‚Äôd never heard of. Easy conclusion: storeX sold my email. Good to know.\n- **Inbox organization**: You can use `+newsletters@live.com`\nfor all your newsletter subscriptions. Then you auto-label them or move them to a folder. Keeps the main inbox clean.\n\n#### A few caveats\n\nOf course, there are always some limitations.\n\n- Some websites are weird about email validation. Even though `+`\nis totally valid in email addresses, some signup forms just don‚Äôt accept it. No idea why.\n- You also can‚Äôt *send* from these addresses unless you go a step further and create real aliases. The plus addresses are just routing tricks, not separate identities.\n\n#### Want to send from a different alias?\n\nIf you actually want to *send* emails from another address, you can go to your Microsoft account and set up a proper alias. It‚Äôs easy:\n\n1. Go to [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/)\n2. Click **Your Info &gt; Manage how you sign in to Microsoft**\n3. Add a new alias, like `rene.shops@outlook.com`\n4. You can even set this alias as your default ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù address in Outlook\n\nTakes a few minutes, and you suddenly have a clean way to separate personal, shopping, newsletter, or even side project mail traffic.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://roadtoalm.com/2025/07/18/the-secret-power-of-the-in-live-outlook-or-hotmail-addresses/?share=twitter)\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://roadtoalm.com/2025/07/18/the-secret-power-of-the-in-live-outlook-or-hotmail-addresses/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://roadtoalm.com/2025/07/18/the-secret-power-of-the-in-live-outlook-or-hotmail-addresses/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail](mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20The%20secret%20power%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9C%2B%E2%80%9D%20in%20live%2C%20outlook%20or%20%20hotmail%20addresses&#038;body=https%3A%2F%2Froadtoalm.com%2F2025%2F07%2F18%2Fthe-secret-power-of-the-in-live-outlook-or-hotmail-addresses%2F&#038;share=email) -\n\nLike Loading‚Ä¶\n\nPrevious Post [Your New Rubber Duck is an¬†AI](https://roadtoalm.com/2025/07/11/your-new-rubber-duck-is-an-ai/)\n\n- Reblog\n- Subscribe\nSubscribed\n\n- [!\\[\\](https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/3c58bd855e307932bb676ddc8476a81e7511cd07428922addbaa7592815435dd?s=50&#038;d=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.wp.com%2Fi%2Flogo%2Fwpcom-gray-white.png) The Road to ALM](https://roadtoalm.com)\n\nJoin 146 other subscribers\n\n- Already have a WordPress.com account?
