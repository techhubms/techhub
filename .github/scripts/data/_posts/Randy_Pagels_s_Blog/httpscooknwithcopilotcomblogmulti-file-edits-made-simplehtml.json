It looks across your project, proposes updates in related files, and gives you a diff view so you can stay in charge of what gets applied.\n\nTry These Approaches\n\n**1️⃣ Refactor Across Files**\n\n`# Update all references to getUserData to use the new fetchUserData function`\n\nCopilot finds and suggests changes wherever the old function is used.\n\n**2️⃣ Modernize Imports**\n\n`# Change all CommonJS require statements to ES module imports`\n\nPerfect for keeping syntax consistent across modules.\n\n**3️⃣ Keep Your Style Consistent**\n\n`# Apply async/await instead of promise chains in all service files`\n\nCopilot proposes edits file-by-file, so you can accept the ones that fit best.\n\n**4️⃣ Preview Before You Apply**\n\nEvery suggestion shows up as a diff. Accept, reject, or tweak them just like you would in a pull request.\n\nExtra Prompts to Try\n\n- # Replace deprecated helper function calls with the updated version\n- # Update API routes and adjust the corresponding tests\n- # Standardize error handling across controllers\n\nQuick Takeaway\n\nWith multi-file Copilot Edits, you can handle wide refactors in minutes instead of hours.\n\nYou’re still in control, but GitHub Copilot does the busywork.",
