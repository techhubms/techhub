What if GitHub Copilot could help you write those prompts too? That‚Äôs what I call Promptception‚Äîusing GitHub Copilot Chat, Edit, or Agent Mode to create, refine, or optimize the prompts you‚Äôll use to get better results. Let‚Äôs break it down!\n\nProTip\n\nUse Copilot to Help You Shape Smarter Prompts Before You Use Them\n\nPromptception isn‚Äôt magic‚Äîit‚Äôs a smart way to guide your workflow. Ask Copilot to help you generate, revise, or improve a prompt before you run it in Chat, Edit, or Agent Mode.\n\nPromptception in Action (Across Copilot Modes):\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Mode: Prompt to Build a Prompt\n\n# I want to test a checkout flow using Playwright. Help me write a Copilot Chat prompt to generate this test.\n\nUse it in Copilot Chat to craft a clear, structured prompt you can reuse.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Edit Mode: Prompt Rewrite Assistance\n\n// Rewrite the comment above to be a more specific Copilot Edit instruction that includes a retry step and network mock\n\nPerfect for refining prompts directly in code using Copilot Edit.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Mode: Meta-Prompt to Set Intent\n\nAct as a GitHub Copilot Agent. Write a prompt I can use to create a custom action in Agent Mode that validates PR titles.\n\nUseful when crafting task descriptions or goals for GitHub Copilot Agents.\n\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Mode: Style-Guided Prompt\n\n# Suggest a prompt that tells Copilot Chat to generate test code that uses async/await and avoids callbacks\n\nGreat for setting the tone or style of generated output.\n\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Chat or Edit Mode: Prompt for Visual Review\n\n# Help me write a prompt I can use to review this code block for clarity, structure, and comments\n\nUse this when preparing prompts to ask for code reviews or summaries.\n\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Mode: Document Review Promptception\n\n# Create a short prompt for me to send back to you. I want you to review a document. Make sure it's grammatically correct, doesn't duplicate any details, and follows a good flow.\n\nUse this to generate a polished review prompt before uploading or pasting the content.\n\nNot too much at all‚Äîgreat addition! Here‚Äôs your final Promptception example for the set:\n\n7Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Mode: README Promptception\n\n# Create a prompt for me to send back to you. I want to generate a README.md file that summarizes what this project does, including its purpose, domain, tech stack, and overall functionality.\n\nüìò Perfect for getting a structured, detailed README prompt ready before Copilot fills it in.\n\n**Quick Takeaway**\n\nPromptception isn‚Äôt just clever‚Äîit‚Äôs practical. Ask GitHub Copilot to help you build the right prompt first, then run that prompt in Chat, Edit, or Agent Mode. It‚Äôs a simple trick that can make a big difference.",
