From there, you can refine the code with follow-up prompts:\n\n- `Add error handling if the city is not found.`\n- `Update the function to use async/await instead of promises.`\n- `Return the response as a formatted string, not just JSON.`\n\n**Takeaway:**\n\nBy iterating this way, you get working API code much faster while still keeping full control over the details.",
