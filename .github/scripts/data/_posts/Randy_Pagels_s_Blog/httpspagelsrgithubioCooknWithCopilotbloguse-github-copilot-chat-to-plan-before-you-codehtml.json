GitHub Copilot isn’t just for finishing code, it’s great at *starting conversations* too.\n\nLet’s break it down!\n\nProTip\n\n**Start with a conversation.** Let GitHub Copilot help you map out your logic, edge cases, and structure, before you ever write a function.\n\n**Try This in GitHub Copilot Chat:**\n\n` Help me outline the steps to build a login flow that checks credentials, tracks failed attempts, and redirects users based on roles. `\n\n*What happens next?* GitHub Copilot responds with a logical breakdown—almost like pair programming—with edge cases, key checks, and a clean outline to work from.\n\n**Follow-Up Prompt:**\n\n` Now turn that into a JavaScript function with placeholders for the missing logic. `\n\nAnd just like that—you’re rolling.\n\nBefore you dive into implementation, getting GitHub Copilot to walk you through the problem helps:\n\n- - Clarify your thinking\n- - Avoid rework\n- - Expose assumptions\n- - Generate better structure\n\nIt’s like having a planning buddy that never gets tired.\n\n**Quick Takeaway**\n\nGitHub Copilot isn’t just a code generator, it’s a thought partner.\n\nTalk through your logic first, then let it build around your plan.\n\nWhat’s the most surprising thing GitHub Copilot helped you figure out before you started coding?\n\nGot a go-to “planning prompt”? Drop it in the chat and share with the crew!",
