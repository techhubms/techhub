Copilot thrives on clear, specific questions. Instead of hoping it reads your mind, give it the context it needs. Let’s break it down!\n\nProTip\n\nBe Direct—Ask Copilot Chat Exactly What You Need\n\nThe better your question, the better your answer. Think about what you’d ask a teammate—and say that.\n\nTry these examples:\n\nInstead of this vague prompt:\n\n# Fix this\n\nAsk this instead:\n\n# This function is timing out, can you suggest a more efficient approach?\n\nInstead of:\n\n# Add comments\n\nTry:\n\n# Add inline comments that explain this logic to someone new to the codebase\n\nWant help improving a prompt?\n\nUse Copilot to help you write better prompts!\n\nIn Copilot Chat:\n\n# Help me write a clear prompt to generate a validation function that checks email and phone number formats\n\nBonus Tip: Ask Copilot to Review Your Prompt\n\nBefore submitting a long or complex prompt, try:\n\n# Is this a good prompt? If not, suggest a better one.\n\n**Quick Takeaway**\n\nGitHub Copilot is only as smart as the question you ask. If your results seem off, it’s often the prompt—not the tool. Treat it like a coding partner, and be clear about what you need.\n\nGot a prompt that always gets great results? Share it with the group—we’re all learning together!",
