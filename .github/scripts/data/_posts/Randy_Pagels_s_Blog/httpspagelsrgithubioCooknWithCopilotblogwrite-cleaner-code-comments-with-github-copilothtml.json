Code that‚Äôs clear is even better.\n\nWell-written comments help teammates (and future you) understand the why behind the code.\n\nWith GitHub Copilot, you don‚Äôt need to pause and think too hard.\n\nJust prompt it to draft comments that make your logic easier to follow.\n\nLet‚Äôs break it down! üìùüíª\n\nProTip\n\n**Ask Copilot to Generate Comments That Explain Your Code Clearly**\n\nInstead of leaving code bare, or writing vague notes, use Copilot Chat, Edit, or Agent Mode to quickly generate helpful, structured comments.\n\n**Try These Approaches**\n\n**1Ô∏è‚É£ Copilot Chat: Add Explanations**\n\n`# Add inline comments explaining each step of this function`\n\nGreat for walking through logic in complex methods.\n\n**2Ô∏è‚É£ Edit Mode: Comment While You Code**\n\nHighlight a block and type:\n\n`# Add docstrings to describe inputs, outputs, and edge cases`\n\nCopilot will generate docstrings that make functions easier to reuse.\n\n**3Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Mode: Review for Readability**\n\nReview this file and suggest clearer inline comments where the logic might confuse a new developer.\n\nPerfect when onboarding teammates or preparing for a code review.\n\n**Extra Prompts to Try**\n\n- # Add comments that explain the purpose of each class property\n- // Generate a top-level comment explaining what this script does\n- # Add inline notes for this algorithm to clarify performance trade-offs\n\n**Quick Takeaway**\n\nReadable code is not only about syntax.\n\nWith a few well-placed prompts, Copilot can help you document logic as you write it, making your code easier to maintain and share.",
