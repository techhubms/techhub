It spans a controller, a model, and maybe even a test.\n\nThat’s where **GitHub Copilot’s multi-file context** comes in. It can reason across your entire project, not just the file in front of you, making its suggestions more complete and accurate.\n\nProTip\n\n**Use Copilot to Understand and Connect Multiple Files**\n\nInstead of copy-pasting code from one file into another or losing track of relationships, you can ask Copilot to connect the dots directly.\n\nTry These Approaches\n\n**1️⃣ Copilot Chat: Cross-File Help**\n\n`# How does data flow from the API route in routes/user.js to the database model in models/user.js?`\n\nCopilot pulls context from both files and explains the connections.\n\n**2️⃣ Edit Mode: Refactor Across Files**\n\nHighlight code in one file and type:\n\n`# Update this method so it stays consistent with changes in services/userService.js`\n\nCopilot revises the code while checking other related files.\n\n**3️⃣ Agent Mode: Bigger Picture**\n\n*Summarize how authentication works across this repo, including middleware, routes, and tests.*\n\nCopilot Agent Mode gives you a high-level overview of connected logic.\n\nExtra Prompts to Try\n\n- # Show me where this function is called across the project\n- # Summarize all tests that validate the login process\n- # Find inconsistencies between this API response and its usage in the frontend",
