Ask yourself:\n\n• Which one handled edge cases better?\n\n• Which one gave clearer, more maintainable code?\n\n• Which one matched your team’s coding style best?\n\nImportant Note\n\nPremium requests may be consumed when using premium models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.\n\nKeep this in mind if you are working within request limits or monitoring usage.\n\nQuick Takeaway\n\nNot all GitHub Copilot setups give you the same choices.\n\nOn Business or Enterprise, your admin decides which models are enabled.\n\nOn Free or Pro tiers, you can experiment directly.\n\nEither way, choosing the right model for the job makes Copilot faster, more reliable, and easier to use day to day.",
