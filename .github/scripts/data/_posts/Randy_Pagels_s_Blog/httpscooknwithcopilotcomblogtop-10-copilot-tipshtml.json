Want to get more out of it? Here are the top 10 ways you can use Copilot to write better code, save time, and make your dev life smoother.\n\nProTips\n\n1. **Start with a comment.** Plain English instructions (or any spoken language) help Copilot “think” in your context. Try “// build a function that…” or “# check if file exists…”\n2. **Prompt for style.** Want a function in a specific style? Just say so: “// as a one-liner” or “// use async/await.”\n3. **Cycle through suggestions.** Press `Alt+]`\nor `Alt+[` (or use `Ctrl+]` /`Ctrl+[` on Mac) to see alternate completions.\n4. **Be specific, not just brief.** “// sort list” works, but “// sort users by signup date descending, handle empty case” is better.\n5. **Refactor with Copilot Chat.** Highlight code, ask Copilot Chat for a rewrite, simplification, or new feature—it’ll walk you through options and let you edit or accept its changes.\n6. **Leverage docs and types.** Copilot uses inline documentation and type hints. Keep your docstrings and JSDoc up-to-date for better predictions.\n7. **Quickly write tests.** Comments like “# test for edge cases” or “// create tests for validation” let Copilot suggest realistic, scenario-based tests.\n8. **Use Copilot in PRs and code reviews.** Summarize diffs, explain code, or auto-generate review comments in VS Code and on GitHub.com.\n9. **Don’t accept everything.** Copilot is smart, not infallible. Review and edit before shipping; it can make mistakes or miss context.\n10. **Share your own pro tips!** The more Copilot learns from real-world usage, the better it gets. Contribute feedback and ideas on the GitHub Copilot repo.\n11. **Use context files strategically.** Open related files in VS Code tabs before coding—Copilot reads your workspace context and suggests code that matches your project's patterns, naming conventions, and architecture.",
