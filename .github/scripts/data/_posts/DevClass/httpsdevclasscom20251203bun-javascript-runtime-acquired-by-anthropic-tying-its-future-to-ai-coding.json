Claude Code uses Bun for its native installer. According to Anthropic Bun has become “essential infrastructure for AI-led software engineering,” thanks to its fast performance and combination of features, which include a runtime, package manager, bundler and test runner. Bun also has the ability to compile to a single-file executable.\n\n![](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/claude.jpg)Anthropic’s Claude Code already uses Bun in its native installer\n\nBun was invented by Jarred Sumner, first previewed in May 2021, and released as version 1.0 in September 2023. Sumner has given his own [overview](https://bun.com/blog/bun-joins-anthropic) of Bun’s history and why he agreed to the acquisition. Sumner admitted to being “kind of obsessed” with Claude Code and said: “The GitHub username with the most merged PRs in Bun’s repo is now a Claude Code bot.” He speculated that most new code might in future be written, tested and deployed by AI agents, and argued that in this scenario the runtime and tooling around the code becomes more important.\n\nThe business model for Bun is also critical. The company behind Bun has raised $26 million in venture capital, Sumner said, but “today, Bun makes $0 in revenue.” He said the original monetization plan was a future hosting offer, but being part of Anthropic gives Bun long-term stability and the team would be able to hire more engineers.\n\nWe note though that Anthropic is also funded by venture capital, so although Bun is now in the hands of a much larger entity, future financial stability is not necessarily assured.\n\nUnlike Bun’s competitors Node.js and Deno, Bun does not use Chromium’s V8 JavaScript engine, but rather JavaScriptCore, part of the Apple-sponsored WebKit project. Another distinctive technology choice is that the language used for native code development in Bun is [Zig](https://ziglang.org), designed as a small language that competes with C. Zig is far from mature, with the current version being 0.15.2, and Zig inventor Andrew Kelley is known for making [breaking changes](https://devclass.com/2025/07/07/zig-lead-makes-extremely-breaking-change-to-std-io-ahead-of-async-and-awaits-return/) as the language evolves.\n\nKelley also has a “strict no LLM [large language model]/No AI policy” in the official [code of conduct](https://ziglang.org/code-of-conduct/#strict-no-llm-no-ai-policy) for Zig contributors. There could be friction ahead if developers now at Anthropic turn their attention to contributing to the Zig language on which Bun depends.\n\nThere are a number of other implications. AI coding tools already tend to default to a TypeScript/JavaScript stack if not instructed otherwise, and the Bun acquisition may further cement that default, even though JavaScript has many flaws. The inventor of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) [said](https://devclass.com/2022/08/04/retire_javascript_says-json-creator-douglas-crockford/) “the best thing we can do today to JavaScript is to retire it,” a possibility that now seems more remote than ever.\n\nAnother key question is how Anthropic will shape the future of Bun. Many acquisitions begin with those involved stating that nothing will change, but this rarely proves to be the case a few years later. Developer views vary. “Anthropic will pump some resources towards platform stability, which could then drive a large migration to Bun,” [commented](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pcg3do/bun_is_joining_anthropic/nry2eee/) one, while another [worried](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pcg3do/bun_is_joining_anthropic/nrxopu3/) about the “potential for either a rug pull or all the goodies going into a paid version”.\n\nUntil now, Bun has been driven by Sumner’s intense drive to develop the product, and under new ownership with different goals some change in direction seems inevitable.\n\n[## AWS Transform revamp uses AI to shift applications from Microsoft’s SQL Server](https://devclass.com/2025/12/02/aws-transform-revamp-uses-ai-to-shift-applications-from-microsofts-sql-server/)[## Zig project ditches GitHub for Codeberg but move could be costly](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/zig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly/)[## OCaml maintainers reject massive AI-generated pull request](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/ocaml-maintainers-reject-massive-ai-generated-pull-request/)[## Microsoft Visual Studio shifts to annual releases, raising cost concerns](https://devclass.com/2025/11/25/microsoft-visual-studio-shifts-to-annual-releases-raising-cost-concerns/)[## Google's Chromium team decides it will add JPEG XL support, reverses 'obsolete' declaration](https://devclass.com/2025/11/24/googles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration/)[## Copilot .Net modernization tool a 'huge downgrade,' devs say – and no longer free](https://devclass.com/2025/11/20/copilot-net-modernization-tool-a-huge-downgrade-devs-say-and-no-longer-free/)[## We take a look at Google's Antigravity: Agentic AI development but some frustrations for early adopt...](https://devclass.com/2025/11/19/googles-antigravity-arrives-agentic-ai-development-but-frustrating-for-early-adopters/)[## Google VP of development explains how 'citizen developers' must be tempered by the pros](https://devclass.com/2025/07/18/google-vp-of-development-explains-how-citizen-developers-must-be-tempered-by-the-pros/)[## AWS S3 gets vector buckets with new algorithms for reasonable performance at lower cost, VP tells us](https://devclass.com/2025/07/17/aws-s3-gets-vector-buckets-with-new-algorithms-for-reasonable-performance-at-lower-cost-vp-tells-us/)[## Hands on with Kiro, the AWS preview of an agentic AI IDE driven by specifications](https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/)[## Microsoft shovels extra Copilot features into VS Code amid dev complaints of 'more AI bloat'](https://devclass.com/2025/07/14/microsoft-shovels-extra-copilot-features-into-vs-code-amid-dev-complaints-of-more-ai-bloat/)[## Docker adds AI agents to Compose along with GPU-powered cloud Offload service](https://devclass.com/2025/07/10/docker-adds-ai-agents-to-compose-along-with-gpu-powered-cloud-offload-service/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
