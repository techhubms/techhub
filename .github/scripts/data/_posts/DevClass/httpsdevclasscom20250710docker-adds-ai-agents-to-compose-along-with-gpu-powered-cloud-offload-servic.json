The enhanced Compose is available now, with support for deployment to Google Cloud Run, for example using the command:\n\ngcloud run compose up\n\nIn this command, gcloud is the Google Cloud CLI (command line interface). Support for Azure Container Apps is coming soon, according to Docker. There is no mention of AWS as yet; though this and other deployment options should be possible using the generic agent support. Compose now supports AI agent orchestration frameworks such as CrewAI, LangGraph, and Spring AI.\n\n![](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/compose-agents.jpg)A Compose configuration file including agentic tools\n\nAlong with the update to Compose, Docker has previewed a remote compute and build service called Docker Offload, now in closed beta. Docker Offload is similar to the existing Build Cloud, but with the addition of Nvidia L4 Tensor Core GPUs, designed for AI workloads. Build Cloud will continue as a separate service. Docker Offload is suitable not only for build, but also for running AI applications for test and development or occasional use.\n\nFeatures of Docker Offload include cloud builds, ephemeral cloud runners, and hybrid workflows where both local and remote compute are in the workflow. Developers can have a local-like experience using port forwarding and bind mounts, and Offload works with the existing buildx and build CLI commands. Multi-platform output is possible. Use of Offload does require Docker Desktop as well as a Pro account or higher. The service is billed in minutes, though prices are not yet available.\n\nThe pricing model for Build Cloud is that each subscription includes some free minutes, and then additional minutes cost from $25 for 500 minutes, but Offload may cost more because of the GPU support.\n\nAs with Build Cloud, Docker Offload currently only uses the US East region, which means that developers elsewhere may see high latency.\n\nIn its press information, Docker made no mention of security issues, though this is a hot topic regarding AI agents. There is an inherent conflict between the demands of automation, which implies a hands-off experience, and that of AI agentic best practice, which is to include human approval steps for tasks which are security-critical. Ephemeral environments like those in Docker Offload, or created via containers on a local computer, mitigate this risk by enabling isolated environments, but it is not a complete solution because of the capabilities of many MCP (model context protocol) agents and the fact that the output will be used in production.\n\nDocker also offers an [MCP Gateway](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-gateway/) which connects to a curated MCP catalog, giving more assurance that the tools themselves are not compromised, but this does not solve the issue of potentially malicious prompts being given to trusted agents.\n\n[## AWS S3 gets vector buckets with new algorithms for reasonable performance at lower cost, VP tells us](https://devclass.com/2025/07/17/aws-s3-gets-vector-buckets-with-new-algorithms-for-reasonable-performance-at-lower-cost-vp-tells-us/)[## Hands on with Kiro, the AWS preview of an agentic AI IDE driven by specifications](https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/)[## Microsoft shovels extra Copilot features into VS Code amid dev complaints of 'more AI bloat'](https://devclass.com/2025/07/14/microsoft-shovels-extra-copilot-features-into-vs-code-amid-dev-complaints-of-more-ai-bloat/)[## Microsoft SQL Server MCP tool: 'Leap in data interaction' or limited and frustrating?](https://devclass.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-sql-server-mcp-tool-leap-in-data-interaction-or-limited-and-frustrating/)[## Cloudflare container platform in public preview with scale to zero pricing, some initial limitations](https://devclass.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-container-platform-in-public-preview-with-scale-to-zero-pricing-some-initial-limitations/)[## Google positions itself for 'next decade' of AI as Gemini CLI arrives with generous free tier](https://devclass.com/2025/06/25/google-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier/)[## CloudBees opens MCP server so agents can infiltrate DevOps](https://devclass.com/2025/06/20/cloudbees-opens-mcp-server-so-agents-can-infiltrate-devops/)[## AI is generating code at scale – but human scale code review can’t keep up](https://devclass.com/2025/06/19/ai-is-generating-code-at-scale-but-human-scale-code-review-cant-keep-up/)[## Redefining identity security in the age of agentic AI](https://devclass.com/2025/06/17/redefining-identity-security-in-the-age-of-agentic-ai/)[## GitLab warms up investors for winter release of agentic AI flavoured Duo Workflow](https://devclass.com/2025/06/13/gitlab-warms-up-investors-for-winter-release-of-agentic-ai-flavoured-duo-workflow/)[## New Relic aims to crack open MCP servers](https://devclass.com/2025/06/11/new-relic-aims-to-crack-open-mcp-servers/)[## Apple's Containerization will matter to developers – but Podman devs complain of unfixed issues](https://devclass.com/2025/06/11/apples-containerization-will-matter-to-developers-but-podman-devs-complain-of-unfixed-issues/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
