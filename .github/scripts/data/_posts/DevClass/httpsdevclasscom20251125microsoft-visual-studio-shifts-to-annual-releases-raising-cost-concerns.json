Meanwhile, Visual C++ (MSVC) is adopting .NET’s release cadence, meaning most versions will receive only nine months of support.\n\n![Many themes in VS 2026 but none as good for coding as the old blue theme, say developers](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/vs2026.jpeg)Many themes in VS 2026 but none as good for coding as the old blue theme, say developers\n\nPrincipal program manager Paul Chapman [said](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-built-for-the-speed-of-modern-development/) the changes align Visual Studio with VS Code’s monthly updates and keep “GitHub Copilot experiences always up to date.” Previously, Visual Studio 2022 remained current for four years. In the case of VS Code, developers have become used to a procession of AI-related feature changes every month, and it seems that keeping up with Copilot is also a factor in these Visual Studio changes.\n\nThe new one year lifecycle for Visual Studio does have consequences for developers using a standalone license rather than a subscription. “If you use a standalone Professional license, you simply purchase the new annual version each year,” said Chapman. A developer [responded](https://old.reddit.com/r/VisualStudio/comments/1p47snl/opinions_on_vs2026/nqk2b12/) that “I hate it that they are planning to release a new major version each year from now on. Means you need to either buy a subscription or purchase a new product key each year.”\n\nThe community edition continues to be available for free, but only for individuals or small organizations (defined as fewer then 250 PCs and less then $1million annual revenue). Otherwise, use of the community edition is restricted by the [license](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/license-terms/vs2026-ga-community/) and excludes most development and testing.\n\nEnterprise customers who value stability more than new features can use a long term servicing channel (LTSC) release which will extend the life of a Visual Studio version for one year.\n\nChapman explained that the IDE is decoupled from the build tools, SDKs and runtimes, which have their own release and support schedules. In the case of MSVC, there will now be a new release every six months (May and November), but these releases will have only 9 months of support. A long-term support (LTS) release will appear every two years, with support for three years. The just-released MSVC 14.5 has been designated an LTS version, aligning with the .NET release cycle.\n\n![The new MSVC release cycle means most versions are only supported for 9 months](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/msvc-1024x415.jpeg)The new MSVC release cycle means most versions are only supported for 9 months\n\n[According](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/new-release-cadence-and-support-lifecycle-for-msvc-build-tools/) to Microsoft group product manager Marian Luparu, driving developers towards recent versions of MSVC is necessary for security and compliance. “Meeting standards, such as NIST [US national institute of standards and technology] and CISA [US cybersecurity and infrastructure agency], means depending on outdated compilers is no longer acceptable,” he said.\n\nVisual Studio users are concerned about things other than Copilot updates. Currently the second-highest voted Visual Studio issue is the [lack of the familiar blue theme](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Bring-Blue-theme-back-for-Visual-Studio/10963534) from previous versions in Visual Studio 2026, dismissed as “out of scope” by Microsoft despite comments such as “bring blue theme back like it was in vs 2017 or 2010, give some colors to icons, make icons bigger, whoever is designing those themes probably never spend a whole day coding.”\n\nAccording to program manager Ruben Rios, “recreating the exact blue theme is not practical. Instead we have introduced tinted themes like Cool Breeze, Cool Slate, and Moonlight Glow.”\n\nDevelopers observed that this demonstrates lack of flexibility in the supposedly improved UI of the latest Visual Studio.\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
