Other issues with Lambda are cold start latency (unless paying extra for provisioned concurrency, which keeps functions permanently initialized) and lack of control over the hardware used other than the architecture (x86 or ARM) and the amount of memory.\n\nLambda managed instances are a new way to provision serverless functions, where the user can specify the exact EC2 instance type used and get discounted prices in return for commitments using compute savings plans or reserved instances. Each instance can handle multiple concurrent requests. These instances are only used for Lambda, and are managed automatically with operating system updates, load balancing, and a maximum lifetime of 14 days. Users define what AWS calls a capacity provider to specify the managed instances and how they should scale, with the initial default being three execution environments across availability zones for resiliency, scaled up automatically based on CPU resource consumption. The concurrency – meaning the number of functions invocations that run simultaneously – can be set to a maximum of 64 per vCPU (virtual CPU).\n\nPricing for Lambda managed instances is based on standard EC2 pricing plus a 15 percent “compute management fee” and a per-request charge of $0.20 per million. Managed instances eliminate the duration charge which applies to normal Lambda functions. This, combined with the ability to apply discounts, means that high volume users may get lower costs as well as better performance. For a light user of Lambda functions, the reverse is true, since the managed instances will be a waste of resources when no functions are running.\n\nThe initially supported runtimes are Java, Node.js, Python and .NET.\n\nIn a news post, AWS [said](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-aws-lambda-managed-instances-serverless-simplicity-with-ec2-flexibility/) the value of managed instances lies in “accessing specialized compute options and optimizing costs for steady-state workloads without sacrificing the serverless development experience.” There will be some large customers for whom managed instances will be a substantial benefit; the new enhancement reduces but does not eliminate the price premium for using the serverless model.\n\nAlongside the Lamba news, AWS also [previewed](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-eks-capabilities-for-workload-orchestration-and-cloud-resource-management/) a set of solutions called EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) Capabilities, which allow users to add managed features including Argo CD (a continuous deployment tool), AWS controllers for Kubernetes which enable management of cloud resources, and Kube Resource Orchestrator for creating and managing custom resources.\n\nAnother key announcement is that of the [AWS MCP Server](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/11/aws-mcp-server/), which combines the capabilities of the existing API MCP server and AWS knowledge server. Using the new MCP server, AI assistants will be able to execute tasks across multiple AWS services, improving the experience for AI prompters but also raising security concerns regarding risks from prompt injection, hallucination or other AI pitfalls. AWS promise that identity and access management as well as audit logging through AWS CloudTrail will give users “full control over resources and permissions.”\n\nAttendees at re:Invent can expect to hear plenty more on this subject, with Swami Sivasubramanian, VP agentic AI, slated to deliver a keynote on Wednesday on the future of agentic AI.\n\n[## Inside the cloud’s shift to Arm: Why hyperscalers and the industry are making the switch](https://devclass.com/2025/11/20/inside-the-clouds-shift-to-arm-why-hyperscalers-and-the-industry-are-making-the-switch/)[## Apple's Containerization will matter to developers – but Podman devs complain of unfixed issues](https://devclass.com/2025/06/11/apples-containerization-will-matter-to-developers-but-podman-devs-complain-of-unfixed-issues/)[## Hands on: AWS simplifies coding and debugging Lambda applications with Visual Studio Code](https://devclass.com/2024/11/07/hands-on-aws-simplifies-coding-and-debugging-lambda-applications-with-visual-studio-code/)[## SQLite will migrate from GNU Autotools to Autosetup, team warns of 'some build-level breakage'](https://devclass.com/2024/10/24/sqlite-will-migrate-from-gnu-autotools-to-autosetup-team-warns-of-some-build-level-breakage/)[## Survey: Ruby on Rails devs happy to go their own way, now prefer Stimulus.js over React](https://devclass.com/2024/09/25/survey-ruby-on-rails-devs-happy-to-go-their-own-way-now-prefer-stimulus-js-over-react/)[## AWS introduces macOS for CodeBuild service, blames Apple licensing requirement for high price](https://devclass.com/2024/08/20/aws-introduces-macos-for-codebuild-service-blames-apple-licensing-requirement-for-high-price/)[## Microsoft backtracks: eventing framework removed from .NET 9.0 following complaints](https://devclass.com/2024/06/26/microsoft-backtracks-eventing-framework-removed-from-net-9-0-following-complaints/)[## GitHub adds Arm64 runners to Actions at last, another advance for Arm](https://devclass.com/2024/06/05/github-adds-arm64-runners-to-actions-at-last-another-advance-for-arm/)[## Google Project IDX remote development environment now in open beta - but without iOS simulator](https://devclass.com/2024/05/15/google-project-idx-remote-development-environment-now-in-open-beta-but-without-ios-simulator/)[## Dapr: not just for Kubernetes or the Microsoft platform, says co-creator Mark Fussell](https://devclass.com/2024/04/22/dapr-not-just-for-kubernetes-or-the-microsoft-platform-says-co-creator-mark-fussell/)[## Cloudflare updates Workers platform with Python support, event notifications, and improved local dev...](https://devclass.com/2024/04/03/cloudflare-updates-workers-platform-with-python-support-event-notifications-and-improved-local-development/)[## Podman 5.0 released with native Mac hypervisor support, new features and breaking changes](https://devclass.com/2024/03/26/podman-5-0-released-with-native-mac-hypervisor-support-new-features-and-breaking-changes/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
