The official Go binaries are not affected.\n\n[According to](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/go/microsoft-go-telemetry/) senior software engineering manager George Adams, telemetry will be added to Go 1.25 and higher, and used to prioritize roadmap items, identify optimization opportunities and understand developer workflows. The data will be anonymized, and there is an opt out by setting the environment variable `MS_GOTOOLCHAIN_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` to `0` .\n\nDoes anyone outside Microsoft use its Go build though? The main reason for developers to use this build has been for FIPS 140-3 compliance, required for applications running in some regulated contexts such as financial and government services. FIPS 140-3 is a security standard which specifies requirements for cryptographic modules.\n\nUntil Go 1.24, released in February 2025, the options for FIPS compliance in Go applications was either to use Go with the BoringCrypto module, based on [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/master/crypto/fipsmodule/FIPS.md), or to use the Microsoft build, which modifies Go to call a platform-provided cryptographic library. However, using the BoringCrypto module is unsupported by Google, even though BoringCrypto itself is FIPS-certified.\n\nIn Go 1.24 this has changed, since there is now a [native FIPS 140-3 mode](https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140). This is currently in process for validation by NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology) though this is not yet complete. Once it is complete, there will be less reason to use Microsoft’s Go build, although Microsoft itself still prefers the system library approach.\n\nAccording to senior software engineer Quim Muntal, the company [evaluated](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/go/go-1-24-fips-update/) using the new Go FIPS module but “determined that this approach doesn’t align with Microsoft internal cryptographic strategy and policies.” Muntal added a carefully worded recommendation to external developers to use the official FIPS module “once it is certified, if it fits their needs.”\n\nAnother issue with Microsoft Go is lack of macOS support, though this has now been added in preview. Muntal said that it is planned to be ready in Go 1.25, expected in August.\n\nMicrosoft’s Go build is also used in Docker images published on the Microsoft Artifact Registry, and with the company’s Linux distribution, Azure Linux. This is “FIPS 140-3 compliant out of the box,” said Muntal.\n\n[## Google VP of development explains how 'citizen developers' must be tempered by the pros](https://devclass.com/2025/07/18/google-vp-of-development-explains-how-citizen-developers-must-be-tempered-by-the-pros/)[## Hands on with Kiro, the AWS preview of an agentic AI IDE driven by specifications](https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/)[## Microsoft shovels extra Copilot features into VS Code amid dev complaints of 'more AI bloat'](https://devclass.com/2025/07/14/microsoft-shovels-extra-copilot-features-into-vs-code-amid-dev-complaints-of-more-ai-bloat/)[## Despite 30 months work, core developer says Python's JIT compiler is often slower than the interpret...](https://devclass.com/2025/07/09/despite-30-months-work-core-developer-says-pythons-jit-compiler-is-often-slower-than-the-interpreter/)[## Zig lead makes 'extremely breaking' change to std.io ahead of Async and Await's return](https://devclass.com/2025/07/07/zig-lead-makes-extremely-breaking-change-to-std-io-ahead-of-async-and-awaits-return/)[## Microsoft SQL Server MCP tool: 'Leap in data interaction' or limited and frustrating?](https://devclass.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-sql-server-mcp-tool-leap-in-data-interaction-or-limited-and-frustrating/)[## Cloudflare container platform in public preview with scale to zero pricing, some initial limitations](https://devclass.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-container-platform-in-public-preview-with-scale-to-zero-pricing-some-initial-limitations/)[## Microsoft to finally expunge the Azure AD Graph API](https://devclass.com/2025/06/30/microsoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api/)[## Avalonia UI sponsorship 'completely removes' open source vs commercial conflict claims CEO](https://devclass.com/2025/06/26/avalonia-ui-sponsorship-completely-removes-open-source-vs-commercial-conflict-claims-ceo/)[## Google positions itself for 'next decade' of AI as Gemini CLI arrives with generous free tier](https://devclass.com/2025/06/25/google-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier/)[## \"Serious\" MySQL bug celebrates 20 years unfixed - another reason to switch to PostgreSQL?](https://devclass.com/2025/06/24/serious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql/)[## React ecosystem is fractured but Vercel is not the villain, argues Redux maintainer](https://devclass.com/2025/06/23/react-ecosystem-is-fractured-but-vercel-is-not-the-villain-argues-redux-maintainer/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
