Fermyon Spin is a framework for building and running microservices on Wasmtime, and a related project called [SpinKube](https://www.spinkube.dev/docs/overview/) enables Wasm workloads on Kubernetes.\n\n[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev) is a Wasm runtime that is coded in Rust. It is open source and a project of the Bytecode Alliance. Since it runs Wasm, it supports programming languages that compile to Wasm including Rust, C, Python, C#, Go and Ruby. Wasmtime is lightweight, sandboxed, and starts up fast when used for serverless functions. When Wasmtime 1.0 was released in September 2022, Fermyon [said](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/wasmtime-1-0-fast-safe-and-production-ready) that “tens of thousands of WebAssembly binaries can run in a single Spin instance while keeping startup times under a millisecond.”\n\n![Fermyon Wasm functions already ran on Akamai's cloud, also known as Linode](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fermyon-1024x562.jpg)Fermyon Wasm Functions already ran on Akamai’s cloud, also known as Linode\n\nAhead of the acquisition, Fermyon was already using Akamai for its Fermyon Wasm Functions, [introduced](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-fermyon-wasm-functions-on-akamai) in March 2025. Akamai [said this week](https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/akamai-announces-acquisition-of-function-as-a-service-company-fermyon) that Fermyon’s function-as-a-service (FaaS) capabilities would enable improved performance and lower costs compared to traditional cloud-native apps, though what “traditional” means in this context is not stated.\n\nAkamai began commercial operations as a content delivery network in 1999, since when it has built a global network with low-latency data delivery to most locations. The company already offers a FaaS solution called EdgeWorkers, based on the V8 JavaScript engine also used by Chrome, Chromium and Node.js. Although that sounds similar to what its competitor Cloudflare offers via Cloudflare Workers, it is Cloudflare that has a more advanced and better-known developer platform. Akamai and Cloudflare specialist Rohit Patil [said in September](https://rohitpatil.com/blog/cloudflare-vs-akamai-cdn-showdown.html) that the developer experience with EdgeWorkers “is more complex and less integrated than Cloudflare’s” and that Cloudflare’s developer platform “is years ahead in terms of vision, usability and ecosystem, making them the default choice for building new applications at the edge.”\n\nThe Fermyon acquisition looks like an attempt to win back some ground with a solution that has some technical advantages over the V8 isolates (sandboxed JavaScript runtime environments) used by Cloudflare workers. The security boundary between isolates may be weak in comparison to the Wasmtime sandboxing. Cloudflare workers [do support Wasm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/webassembly/) but the docs warn of slower start-up.\n\nFermyon co-founder Mike Butcher [said](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/fermyon-joins-akamai) that open source contributions to the Spin framework, SpinKube and Wasmtime will continue.\n\n[## Bun JavaScript runtime acquired by Anthropic, tying its future to AI coding](https://devclass.com/2025/12/03/bun-javascript-runtime-acquired-by-anthropic-tying-its-future-to-ai-coding/)[## AWS debuts Lambda managed instances on EC2: more control, lower cost for high volume users](https://devclass.com/2025/12/01/aws-debuts-lambda-managed-instances-on-ec2-more-control-lower-cost-for-high-volume-users/)[## Zig project ditches GitHub for Codeberg but move could be costly](https://devclass.com/2025/11/27/zig-project-ditches-github-for-codeberg-but-move-could-be-costly/)[## Google's Chromium team decides it will add JPEG XL support, reverses 'obsolete' declaration](https://devclass.com/2025/11/24/googles-chromium-team-decides-it-will-add-jpeg-xl-support-reverses-obsolete-declaration/)[## Copilot .Net modernization tool a 'huge downgrade,' devs say – and no longer free](https://devclass.com/2025/11/20/copilot-net-modernization-tool-a-huge-downgrade-devs-say-and-no-longer-free/)[## Inside the cloud’s shift to Arm: Why hyperscalers and the industry are making the switch](https://devclass.com/2025/11/20/inside-the-clouds-shift-to-arm-why-hyperscalers-and-the-industry-are-making-the-switch/)[## We take a look at Google's Antigravity: Agentic AI development but some frustrations for early adopt...](https://devclass.com/2025/11/19/googles-antigravity-arrives-agentic-ai-development-but-frustrating-for-early-adopters/)[## Google VP of development explains how 'citizen developers' must be tempered by the pros](https://devclass.com/2025/07/18/google-vp-of-development-explains-how-citizen-developers-must-be-tempered-by-the-pros/)[## Hands on with Kiro, the AWS preview of an agentic AI IDE driven by specifications](https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/)[## Microsoft shovels extra Copilot features into VS Code amid dev complaints of 'more AI bloat'](https://devclass.com/2025/07/14/microsoft-shovels-extra-copilot-features-into-vs-code-amid-dev-complaints-of-more-ai-bloat/)[## Docker adds AI agents to Compose along with GPU-powered cloud Offload service](https://devclass.com/2025/07/10/docker-adds-ai-agents-to-compose-along-with-gpu-powered-cloud-offload-service/)[## Despite 30 months work, core developer says Python's JIT compiler is often slower than the interpret...](https://devclass.com/2025/07/09/despite-30-months-work-core-developer-says-pythons-jit-compiler-is-often-slower-than-the-interpreter/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
