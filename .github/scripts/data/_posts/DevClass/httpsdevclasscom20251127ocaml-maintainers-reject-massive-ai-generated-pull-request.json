Typically, OCaml developers use the bytecode compiler for developing and testing their code, but may use the native compiler for production. There are built-in tools for debugging OCaml bytecode but debugging with the native compiler is more limited.\n\nDeveloper Joel Reymont was frustrated by the lack of DWARF debugging information when using the native compiler and turned to Claude Code to add this feature, [DWARF](https://dwarfstd.org) being a standard format used by many debuggers including lldb (the LLVM debugger) and gdb (GNU debugger). Reymont [described](https://joel.id/native-binary-debugging-for-ocaml/) on his blog how he used Anthropic’s Claude Code to add the feature to the OCaml native compiler, and said “I did not write a single line of code but carefully shepherded AI over the course of several days … my work was just directing, shaping, cajoling and reviewing.” Reymont submitted the code as a [pull request](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14369) to the OCaml GitHub repository.\n\nA curious aspect to the submission was that some of the source code was credited to Mark Shinwell at Jane Street Europe, a financial trading company whose research includes an open source project called [OxCaml](https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-oxcaml/), described as a safer and more performant version of OCaml, and which includes DWARF debugging support.\n\n![Many files in the AI-generated code credit Mark Shinwell as the author - though the AI also insisted that no code was copied](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ocaml-1024x686.jpg)Many files in the AI-generated code credit Mark Shinwell as the author – though the AI also insisted that no code was copied\n\n“This seems to be largely a copy of the work done in OxCaml” remarked OCaml contributor Tim McGilchrist, who is also working on the project. Asked why some of the files credited Shinwell as the author, Reymont [said](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14369#issuecomment-3557357958), “Beats me. AI decided to do so and I didn’t question it.”\n\nShinwell also consulted AI regarding the copyright, which [told him](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14369#issuecomment-3556624486) that “I conclude that no code was copied from oxcaml” and gave reasons. Unconvinced, maintainer Gabriel Scherer [said](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14369#issuecomment-3556593972) “the fact that the tool that produced the code attributes its copyright to a real human is a clear sign that something is an issue.”\n\nOther issues identified included lack of a design discussion regarding the feature, difficulty in reviewing such a “humungous amount of code,” the future maintenance burden, and the fact that others were working on a similar feature that was not yet ready for upstreaming – this being the DWARF support in OxCaml.\n\nThree years ago, Scherer [posted](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/maintenance-bottlenecks-in-the-compiler-distribution/11045) that OCaml “maintainers have been constantly complaining that there are more people willing to submit changes/PRs than people willing to review them, creating a bottleneck on the reviewing side.” This situation has not improved, and for people to submit “very large relatively-low-effort PRs creates a real risk of bringing the Pull-Request system to a halt,” Scherer said in a comment on Reymont’s PR. He added that in his experience, reviewing AI-generated code is more taxing than reviewing human-written code.\n\nFollowing some discussion, Scherer [closed](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/14369#issuecomment-3556679165) the pull request, stating that “none of the people who could plausibly be interested in reviewing and supporting a DWARF-support PR seem willing to consider doing the work … so I think that this has no chance of being merged.” He said it was not a value judgement of the code, but the development approach did not align with those of the project. “Currently github/ocaml as it is organized is not able to work in this way.”\n\nA claim by Reymont that the AI had “deep understanding” of the code was challenged by another developer as showing a lack of knowledge about how LLMs (large language models) work.\n\nDespite the issues with this particular PR, the fact that Claude Code was able, with human oversight, to come up with a working feature of such intricacy is in itself impressive – though the reliability and quality of the code is not known.\n\nScherer remarked in another comment that “getting good native-debugging support in the OCaml compiler would be very nice,” adding that the difficulty was to find a way of doing this that had a reasonable maintenance burden. He also said the OCaml project lacked a “clear policy for what we expect regarding AI-assisted code contributions.”\n\nConsidering the strong push for AI coding from industry giants including Microsoft, Google and AWS, it is inevitable the volume of PRs submitted to open source projects that are coded all or part using AI will increase. AI optimists may believe that AI itself can review these PRs satisfactorily, but there are obvious risks in this given that LLM output is not deterministic and problems such as hallucination and prompt injection remain unsolved.\n\n[## Microsoft Visual Studio shifts to annual releases, raising cost concerns](https://devclass.com/2025/11/25/microsoft-visual-studio-shifts-to-annual-releases-raising-cost-concerns/)[## We take a look at Google's Antigravity: Agentic AI development but some frustrations for early adopt...](https://devclass.com/2025/11/19/googles-antigravity-arrives-agentic-ai-development-but-frustrating-for-early-adopters/)[## AWS S3 gets vector buckets with new algorithms for reasonable performance at lower cost, VP tells us](https://devclass.com/2025/07/17/aws-s3-gets-vector-buckets-with-new-algorithms-for-reasonable-performance-at-lower-cost-vp-tells-us/)[## Hands on with Kiro, the AWS preview of an agentic AI IDE driven by specifications](https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/)[## Microsoft shovels extra Copilot features into VS Code amid dev complaints of 'more AI bloat'](https://devclass.com/2025/07/14/microsoft-shovels-extra-copilot-features-into-vs-code-amid-dev-complaints-of-more-ai-bloat/)[## Docker adds AI agents to Compose along with GPU-powered cloud Offload service](https://devclass.com/2025/07/10/docker-adds-ai-agents-to-compose-along-with-gpu-powered-cloud-offload-service/)[## Microsoft SQL Server MCP tool: 'Leap in data interaction' or limited and frustrating?](https://devclass.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-sql-server-mcp-tool-leap-in-data-interaction-or-limited-and-frustrating/)[## Google positions itself for 'next decade' of AI as Gemini CLI arrives with generous free tier](https://devclass.com/2025/06/25/google-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier/)[## CloudBees opens MCP server so agents can infiltrate DevOps](https://devclass.com/2025/06/20/cloudbees-opens-mcp-server-so-agents-can-infiltrate-devops/)[## AI is generating code at scale – but human scale code review can’t keep up](https://devclass.com/2025/06/19/ai-is-generating-code-at-scale-but-human-scale-code-review-cant-keep-up/)[## Redefining identity security in the age of agentic AI](https://devclass.com/2025/06/17/redefining-identity-security-in-the-age-of-agentic-ai/)[## GitLab warms up investors for winter release of agentic AI flavoured Duo Workflow](https://devclass.com/2025/06/13/gitlab-warms-up-investors-for-winter-release-of-agentic-ai-flavoured-duo-workflow/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
