Istio is open source service mesh software that is widely used with Kubernetes, and if compromised could impact thousands of enterprises. The token has now been revoked.\n\nThe problem is what happens when a developer accidentally commits code that includes secrets, realizes their mistake, and attempts to remove the commit. Git repositories are designed to preserve code history, so to remove a commit is working against this; even though there are circumstances in which it is essential. A developer, for example, might hard-code a password for a quick test, or forget to exclude a file or directory containing secrets from the repository, and then make the commit before discovering the error.\n\nIn this case, how does one stop the erroneous commit from replicating to all developers fetching code from the repository? It is not a new problem; there is a question about it [from 2009](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448919/how-can-i-remove-a-commit-on-github) on StackOverflow. The quick answer is called a force push; developers can reset the commit history to before it happened and then use git force push to make the same change on the origin repository. This works to some extent, in that it rewrites the commit history and other developers who have not already fetched the erroneous commit will not now see it, but it is not a complete solution. The bad commit remains in the GitHub cache, and can be retrieved via its hash.\n\nAll this has been well-known for years. “The commit can still be accessible directly via SHA1. Force push does not delete the commit, it creates a new one and moves the file pointer to it. To truly delete a commit you must delete the whole repo,” [said a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448919/how-can-i-remove-a-commit-on-github#comment21828959_448919) back in 2013.\n\nGitHub has a [support article](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository) on the topic which includes using a utility called git-filter-repo before making a force push, but also adds that GitHub support must be contacted to remove all traces of the compromised data. Support will deference or delete any affected pull requests, run garbage collection on the server, remove cached views, and purge orphaned LFS (Large File Storage) objects.\n\nThat is a lot of work to undo an error that took only a moment, making it unsurprising that developers on occasion look for a quicker solution or are perhaps unwilling to confess an embarrassing mistake.\n\nThe problem is made worse by the existence of [GH Archive](https://www.gharchive.org), a project which records all activity on public repositories and stores it in a public dataset on Google BigQuery. This is handy for research, but also ideal for security researchers (or worse) looking for orphaned commits, which is how these deleted commits end up, if not properly processed. Brizinov used this along with a quickly coded application to grab these commits and look for secrets. “The most interesting leaked secrets were GitHub PAT tokens and AWS credentials,” he said. A common error was including a .env (environment) file within a commit, accounting for just over half of the leaks.\n\nThis is not really a GitHub flaw, though developers would be helped if there were some way of actually deleting commits without having to raise a support request.\n\nAnother option when suffering this kind of incident is to remove the value of the leaked secrets by immediately revoking tokens and changing leaked passwords.\n\nTruffle Security offers a utility to find leaked secrets for specific organizations, but it may be too late.\n\nGitHub suggests in its support article that developers avoid making the bad commits, by observing best practice and by scanning for sensitive data using a pre-commit hook invoking something like [AWS git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets).\n\n[## \"Serious\" MySQL bug celebrates 20 years unfixed - another reason to switch to PostgreSQL?](https://devclass.com/2025/06/24/serious-mysql-bug-celebrates-20-years-unfixed-another-reason-to-switch-to-postgresql/)[## Misconfigured GitHub Actions could leave repos and secrets exposed, Sysdig finds](https://devclass.com/2025/06/18/misconfigured-github-actions-could-leave-repos-and-secrets-exposed-sysdig-finds/)[## Redefining identity security in the age of agentic AI](https://devclass.com/2025/06/17/redefining-identity-security-in-the-age-of-agentic-ai/)[## Cursor AI editor hits 1.0 milestone, including BugBot and high-risk background agents](https://devclass.com/2025/06/06/cursor-ai-editor-hits-1-0-milestone-including-bugbot-and-high-risk-background-agents/)[## Researchers warn of prompt injection vulnerability in GitHub MCP with no obvious fix](https://devclass.com/2025/05/27/researchers-warn-of-prompt-injection-vulnerability-in-github-mcp-with-no-obvious-fix/)[## MCP will be built into Windows to make an 'agentic OS' but security will be a key concern](https://devclass.com/2025/05/19/mcp-will-be-built-into-windows-to-make-an-agentic-os-but-security-will-be-a-key-concern/)[## PHP security audit of critical code reveals flaws, fixed in new release](https://devclass.com/2025/04/14/php-security-audit-of-critical-code-reveals-flaws-fixed-in-new-release/)[## The risks of GitHub Actions: Researcher describes severe potential of CodeQL vulnerability, now fixe...](https://devclass.com/2025/04/02/the-risks-of-github-actions-researcher-describes-severe-potential-of-codeql-vulnerability-now-fixed/)[## Next.js team fixes vuln that allows auth bypass when middleware is used, revises documentation recom...](https://devclass.com/2025/03/24/next-js-team-fixes-vuln-that-allows-authorization-bypass-when-middleware-is-used-hastily-revises-documentation-recommending-this-method/)[## Third-party libraries cause more security woes than first-party code, open-source flaws take longer ...](https://devclass.com/2025/03/11/third-party-libraries-cause-more-security-woes-than-first-party-code-open-source-flaws-take-longer-to-fix/)[## AWS Amplify hosting adds server-side IAM roles for integration with other services](https://devclass.com/2025/02/19/aws-amplify-hosting-adds-server-side-iam-roles-for-integration-with-other-services/)[## AWS will pay devs to verify Rust standard library because of 7,500 unsafe functions and enormity of ...](https://devclass.com/2024/11/21/aws-will-pay-devs-to-verify-rust-standard-library-because-of-7500-unsafe-functions-and-enormity-of-task/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
