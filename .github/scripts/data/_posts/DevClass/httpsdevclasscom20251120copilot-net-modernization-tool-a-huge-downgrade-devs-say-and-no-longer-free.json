An existing .Net upgrade assistant extension for Visual Studio has been replaced with GitHub Copilot app modernization, which was [made generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-22-github-copilot-app-modernization-is-now-generally-available-for-java-and-net/) in September. This new modernize agent can be summoned via Copilot Chat, and requires a Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business or Enterprise subscription. Attempting to use GitHub Copilot app modernization without the requisite license displays an error message.\n\nMigrating from Windows-only .Net Framework is important for several reasons. One is that .NET Framework is maintained but there is little active development; the latest version is 4.8.1 from August 2022, which added native Arm64 support but not much else. Second, .Net Core (now officially just called .Net) is cross-platform, and runs well on Linux, reducing both friction and licensing fees for deploying to cloud platforms.\n\n![The new &quot;app modernisation experience&quot; in Visual Studio 2026](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/modernize-660x1024.jpg)The new “app modernization experience” in Visual Studio 2026\n\nSenior product manager Mika Dumont posted about the new experience, provoking a quick response from developers. “Nowhere near ready for real world use,” [said one](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/modernizing-dotnet-with-github-copilot-agent-mode/?commentid=22611#comment-22611), noting issues with upgrading an application from .Net Framework 4.7.2  including that “it tried to update our MVC [Model View Controller] and API controllers but ultimately failed … we had to manually update all the controllers” and that “we had 100s of hours of manual work to fix the partial upgrade of the projects.”\n\nAnother complaint is that the old upgrade assistant was superior. It was, [said another](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/modernizing-dotnet-with-github-copilot-agent-mode/?commentid=22606#comment-22606) dev, “a formalized process with clear, guided-through steps, and clear scope.” Copilot, by contrast, is “less performant, less formalized and deterministic, increasing risks.”\n\n“New feature is a huge downgrade from the free option we previously had,” said [another comment](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/modernizing-dotnet-with-github-copilot-agent-mode/?commentid=22610#comment-22610).\n\n![It is possible to enable the old upgrade assistant, but the setting is buried and includes a plug for using Copilot instead](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/upgradeenble-1024x231.jpg)It is possible to enable the old upgrade assistant, but the setting is buried and includes a plug for using Copilot instead\n\nAlthough now hidden, the upgrade assistant is still available in Visual Studio 2026, via Tools – Options – Projects and Solutions – Modernization – Enable legacy Upgrade Assistant.\n\nPure C# or Visual Basic.Net code migrates easily to .Net Core, but many business applications were built using Windows-only features and third-party add-ons which are challenging to migrate, likely requiring substantial new code.\n\nSeparately, Microsoft previewed a service called Managed Instance on Azure App Service specifically for .NET Framework applications, at its Ignite conference under way this week in San Francisco, USA. Managed Instance is designed to support features which hinder migration to .NET Core, including custom COM components, Windows registry access, file share access via mapped drives, custom Windows services and more; admins can even get a remote desktop on a Managed Instance to get to tools such as IIS manager, event viewer and MMC (Microsoft Management Console) snap-ins, though the docs [state](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/overview-managed-instance) that this is only for diagnostics and that persistent changes require scripts.\n\nThe introduction of Managed Instance shows the company’s recognition of the migration challenges, with or without AI.\n\nReturning to the Copilot issue, part of the concern is that AI-driven tools are inherently more expensive to run, particularly when invoking cloud-hosted LLM (large language model) processing. If more free tools are replaced with subscription-based AI alternatives, costs will inevitably increase.\n\n[## We take a look at Google's Antigravity: Agentic AI development but some frustrations for early adopt...](https://devclass.com/2025/11/19/googles-antigravity-arrives-agentic-ai-development-but-frustrating-for-early-adopters/)[## Google VP of development explains how 'citizen developers' must be tempered by the pros](https://devclass.com/2025/07/18/google-vp-of-development-explains-how-citizen-developers-must-be-tempered-by-the-pros/)[## Hands on with Kiro, the AWS preview of an agentic AI IDE driven by specifications](https://devclass.com/2025/07/15/hands-on-with-kiro-the-aws-preview-of-an-agentic-ai-ide-driven-by-specifications/)[## Microsoft shovels extra Copilot features into VS Code amid dev complaints of 'more AI bloat'](https://devclass.com/2025/07/14/microsoft-shovels-extra-copilot-features-into-vs-code-amid-dev-complaints-of-more-ai-bloat/)[## Despite 30 months work, core developer says Python's JIT compiler is often slower than the interpret...](https://devclass.com/2025/07/09/despite-30-months-work-core-developer-says-pythons-jit-compiler-is-often-slower-than-the-interpreter/)[## Things Go better with telemetry: Microsoft adds phone home to its Go build](https://devclass.com/2025/07/08/things-go-better-with-telemetry-microsoft-adds-phone-home-to-its-go-build/)[## Zig lead makes 'extremely breaking' change to std.io ahead of Async and Await's return](https://devclass.com/2025/07/07/zig-lead-makes-extremely-breaking-change-to-std-io-ahead-of-async-and-awaits-return/)[## Microsoft SQL Server MCP tool: 'Leap in data interaction' or limited and frustrating?](https://devclass.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-sql-server-mcp-tool-leap-in-data-interaction-or-limited-and-frustrating/)[## Cloudflare container platform in public preview with scale to zero pricing, some initial limitations](https://devclass.com/2025/07/01/cloudflare-container-platform-in-public-preview-with-scale-to-zero-pricing-some-initial-limitations/)[## Microsoft to finally expunge the Azure AD Graph API](https://devclass.com/2025/06/30/microsoft-to-finally-expunge-the-azure-ad-graph-api/)[## Avalonia UI sponsorship 'completely removes' open source vs commercial conflict claims CEO](https://devclass.com/2025/06/26/avalonia-ui-sponsorship-completely-removes-open-source-vs-commercial-conflict-claims-ceo/)[## Google positions itself for 'next decade' of AI as Gemini CLI arrives with generous free tier](https://devclass.com/2025/06/25/google-positions-itself-for-next-decade-of-ai-as-gemini-cli-arrives-with-generous-free-tier/)\n\n[!\\[DevClass\\](https://devclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/DevClass_logo_White_small-Horizontal.png)DevClassDeveloper News](https://devclass.com/)\n\n### ABOUT US\n\nDevClass is the news and analysis site covering modern software development issues, from the team behind the Continuous Lifecycle, Serverless Computing and MCubed conferences\n\nContact us: [devclass@sitpub.com](mailto:devclass@sitpub.com)\n\n### FOLLOW US\n\n[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devclass/)\n\n[RSS](https://devclass.com/feed/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/d3vclass?lang=en)\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEk1p4Omxqi0E0ij6Bfy4HQ)\n\n© Situation Publishing, 2018-2024\n\n- [About](https://devclass.com/about/)\n- [Contribute](https://devclass.com/contribute/)\n- [Contact](https://devclass.com/contact-us/)\n- [Sales](https://situationpublishing.com/home/contact-us/)\n- [Privacy](https://devclass.com/privacy/)\n- [Cookies](https://devclass.com/cookies/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://devclass.com/tc/)\n- [Do not sell my personal information](https://devclass.com/devclass-privacy-policy-for-california-residents/)",
