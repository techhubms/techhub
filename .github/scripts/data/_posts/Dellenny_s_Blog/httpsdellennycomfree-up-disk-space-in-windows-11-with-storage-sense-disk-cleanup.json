Fortunately, Windows 11 includes two built-in tools designed to help you reclaim valuable storage: **Storage Sense** and **Disk Cleanup**. These tools offer automatic and manual solutions for getting rid of temporary files, system cache, old downloads, previous Windows installations, and other clutter that takes up unnecessary space.\n\nWhether you’re using a laptop with a smaller SSD or a desktop with multiple drives, learning how to use these tools can keep your system clean and responsive. In this guide, we’ll walk through what Storage Sense and Disk Cleanup do, how to use them effectively, and how to set up automatic cleanup routines so you never run out of space again.\n\n## **What Is Storage Sense in Windows 11?**\n\n**Storage Sense** is a built-in feature that automatically manages and removes unnecessary files from your device. It’s especially helpful for users who don’t want to manually check for storage issues.\n\nStorage Sense can:\n\n- Delete temporary system files\n- Clear files in the Recycle Bin after a set number of days\n- Remove items from the Downloads folder if you choose\n- Clean up previous Windows update files\n- Optimize your OneDrive cloud sync\n\nThe best part? Storage Sense can run automatically in the background.\n\n## **How to Access and Enable Storage Sense**\n\nFollow these simple steps to activate Storage Sense:\n\n1. **Open Settings**\nPress `Windows + I` to launch the Settings app.\n2. **Go to System > Storage**\nThis section displays your storage usage.\n3. **Locate Storage Sense**\nToggle the switch to turn it *On*.\n4. **Configure cleanup schedule**\nClick on **Storage Sense** to open its detailed settings.\n\nHere, you can adjust important cleanup rules such as:\n\n- Run Storage Sense during low disk space\n- Run periodically (every day, week, or month)\n- Automatically delete temporary files\n- Automatically clear Recycle Bin items older than a chosen number of days\n- Automatically remove items in your Downloads folder\n\n**Tip:** If you store important files in Downloads, disable automatic cleanup for that folder.\n\n## **Using “Cleanup Recommendations” in Windows 11**\n\nBefore you even run Storage Sense or Disk Cleanup, Windows 11 provides cleanup suggestions:\n\n1. Go to **Settings > System > Storage**\n2. Click **Cleanup recommendations**\n\nThis shows categories such as:\n\n- Large or unused files\n- Temporary files\n- Files synced to the cloud\n- Unused apps\n\nYou can preview and delete these items safely. This feature alone can free up several gigabytes, particularly after system updates.\n\n## **What Is Disk Cleanup in Windows 11?**\n\nWhile Storage Sense is newer and more automated, **Disk Cleanup** is a classic Windows tool that provides deeper manual control. It’s useful for clearing:\n\n- Windows Update cleanup\n- Temporary installation files\n- System error logs\n- Delivery Optimization files\n- Thumbnails\n- Old Windows installation folders (Windows.old)\n\nThis tool is especially helpful after big updates or when you need to reclaim a large chunk of storage quickly.\n\n## **How to Use Disk Cleanup in Windows 11**\n\nHere’s the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Open Start Menu**\nSearch for **Disk Cleanup** and open it.\n2. **Choose a Drive**\nSelect the drive you want to clean (usually C:).\n3. **Scan for Files**\nDisk Cleanup scans for unnecessary files.\n4. **Select What to Delete**\nCheck the boxes next to categories you want cleaned.\n5. **Click “Clean up system files”**\nThis reveals additional system-level files like Windows Update cleanup.\n6. **Run the Cleanup**\nClick **OK** to start deleting files.\n\n**Note:** Removing “Previous Windows installations” (Windows.old) can free up 10–20 GB, but prevents rolling back to the previous version.\n\n## **Storage Sense vs. Disk Cleanup: Which Should You Use?**\n\nBoth tools serve similar purposes, but each shines in different ways.\n\n### **Storage Sense: Best for automatic cleanup**\n\n- Runs in the background\n- Good for regular maintenance\n- Helps users who don’t want to delete files manually\n- Great for managing Recycle Bin, temp files, and Downloads folder\n\n### **Disk Cleanup: Best for large, manual, and deep cleanups**\n\n- Removes older Windows installations\n- Clears update leftover files\n- Ideal after major upgrades\n- Gives more granular control\n\n**Recommended approach:** Use Storage Sense for regular maintenance and Disk Cleanup for occasional deep cleaning.\n\n## **Additional Tips to Free Up Space on Windows 11**\n\nBeyond the built-in tools, try these extra steps:\n\n### 1. **Uninstall Unused Apps**\n\nGo to **Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed apps** and remove programs you don’t need.\n\n### 2. **Move Large Files to External Storage**\n\nVideos, ISO files, and backups can consume gigabytes.\n\n### 3. **Enable OneDrive Files On-Demand**\n\nThis keeps files in the cloud instead of on your disk.\n\n### 4. **Empty the Recycle Bin Regularly**\n\nFiles stay there until manually deleted.\n\n### 5. **Disable Hibernation (Advanced Users)**\n\nThis can save several gigabytes by removing hiberfil.sys.\n\nWindows 11 makes it incredibly easy to free up disk space using Storage Sense and Disk Cleanup. Whether you want automatic, worry-free cleanup or deeper manual control over system files, these built-in tools help you maintain performance, avoid storage warnings, and create a smoother computing experience.\n\nBy combining Storage Sense’s automation with Disk Cleanup’s power, you can ensure your Windows 11 device stays fast, organized, and clutter-free. Make it a habit to check your storage settings occasionally, and you’ll never have to struggle with low disk space again.\n\nIf you’d like help optimizing your PC even further, installing tools, or cleaning your registry safely—just ask!\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/free-up-disk-space-in-windows-11-with-storage-sense-disk-cleanup/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/free-up-disk-space-in-windows-11-with-storage-sense-disk-cleanup/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/free-up-disk-space-in-windows-11-with-storage-sense-disk-cleanup/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/free-up-disk-space-in-windows-11-with-storage-sense-disk-cleanup/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/free-up-disk-space-in-windows-11-with-storage-sense-disk-cleanup/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3533)\n\nTags:[Windows 11](https://dellenny.com/tag/windows-11/ \"Windows 11\")\n\n[previousTroubleshooting Copilot Failures: A Guide to Diagnosing “Not Grounded” and “Permission Denied” Errors](https://dellenny.com/troubleshooting-copilot-errors-fix-not-grounded-permission-issues/)\n\n[nextManaging App Permissions for Better Privacy in Windows 11 A Complete Guide](https://dellenny.com/managing-app-permissions-for-better-privacy-in-windows-11-a-complete-guide/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3533)\n\n%d",
