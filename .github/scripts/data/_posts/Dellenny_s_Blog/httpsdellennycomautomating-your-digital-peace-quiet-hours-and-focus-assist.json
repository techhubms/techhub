Windows’ **Focus Assist** and **Quiet Hours** are great tools for silencing distractions — but if you have to remember to turn them on manually, you’re missing the real magic.\n\nWith a little bit of automation using **Task Scheduler**, you can make Focus Assist turn on and off exactly when you need it — no clicks, no “oops I forgot,” and no lost concentration.\n\n## Why Automate Focus Assist & Quiet Hours?\n\n- **Predictable deep work** — Silence notifications automatically during your prime productivity hours.\n- **Meeting-friendly mode** — Automatically activate Focus Assist when you start certain apps (like Zoom or PowerPoint).\n- **Context-based peace** — Turn it on only when your laptop is plugged in, or during specific time windows.\n- **Stress-free evenings** — Have notifications fade away after a set hour so you can relax.\n\n## Step 1: Know Your Focus Assist Modes\n\nWindows offers three main levels:\n\n1. **Off** — All notifications come through.\n2. **Priority Only** — Only apps and contacts you’ve allowed.\n3. **Alarms Only** — Nothing but alarms will disturb you.\n\nIn automation, you’ll often use either **Priority Only** or **Alarms Only**.\n\n## Step 2: Creating a Task Scheduler Rule\n\n1. **Open Task Scheduler**\nPress `Windows + R` , type `taskschd.msc` , and hit Enter.\n2. **Create a New Task**\nGo to **Action &gt; Create Task** (not “Basic Task” — you’ll want full control).\n3. **Set the Trigger**\n- **Time-based**: Example — every weekday from 9 AM to 12 PM.\n- **Event-based**: On workstation lock/unlock, app launch, or AC power connection.\n- **Condition-based**: Only run when plugged in or idle.\n4. **Add the Action**\n- Go to **Actions &gt; New &gt; Start a program**\n- Program/script: CopyEdit`powershell.exe`\n- Add arguments: pgsqlCopyEdit`(New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application).ToggleDesktop() ; Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 500 ; (Get-Service -Name 'ShellHWDetection').Status`\n*(Replace with your chosen PowerShell command for enabling Focus Assist; examples below.)*\n\n## Step 3: PowerShell Commands for Focus Assist\n\nUnfortunately, Focus Assist doesn’t have a direct command-line toggle in standard Windows APIs. But you can use **registry edits** or **third-party utilities** or powershell as below to set its mode.\n\nFor example (registry method):\n\n- **Enable Priority Only** powershellCopyEdit`reg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Notifications\\Settings /v NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_TOASTS_ENABLED /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`\n- **Disable Focus Assist** powershellCopyEdit`reg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Notifications\\Settings /v NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_TOASTS_ENABLED /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`\n\n*(You’ll need to restart Windows Explorer or log off/on for changes to fully apply.)*\n\n## Step 4: Example Automation Scenarios\n\n- **Work Mode**\nTrigger: 9 AM weekdays Action: Focus Assist → Priority Only Condition: Plugged in\n- **Meeting Mode**\nTrigger: When Zoom.exe starts Action: Focus Assist → Alarms Only\n- **Evening Quiet Hours**\nTrigger: 8 PM daily Action: Focus Assist → Priority Only\n\n## Step 5: Going Beyond Basics\n\n- Combine with **Do Not Disturb in Microsoft Teams** using Graph API calls.\n- Integrate with **Bluetooth device connection** (e.g., when your headset connects, Focus Assist turns on).\n- Use **IFTTT** or **Power Automate** for cross-device sync (e.g., phone + PC quiet hours match).\n\n## PowerShell Scripts for Focus Assist\n\n### 1. **Enable Focus Assist (Turn On Do-Not-Disturb)**\n\n``` powershellCopyEditSet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Notifications\\Settings\" ` -Name \"NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_TOASTS_ENABLED\" -Value 0 -Force\n\n```\n\nThis disables toast notifications, effectively activating Focus Assist.\n\n### 2. **Disable Focus Assist (Turn Off Do-Not-Disturb)**\n\n``` powershellCopyEditSet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Notifications\\Settings\" ` -Name \"NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_TOASTS_ENABLED\" -Value 1 -Force\n\n```\n\n### 3. **Comprehensive Disable (Windows 10 & 11 – including Quiet Hours)**\n\n``` powershellCopyEdit# Disable Quiet Hours and Do Not Disturb Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\FocusAssist\" ` -Name \"QuietHoursActive\" -Value 0 -Force Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\FocusAssist\" ` -Name \"QuietHoursEnabled\" -Value 0 -Force Set-ItemProperty -Path \"HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Notifications\\Settings\" ` -Name \"NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_DND\" -Value 0 -Force\n\n```\n\nThis script updates additional focus-related registry keys for consistent control across Windows versions.\n\n## How to Use These Scripts\n\n1. Save the script(s) in `.ps1`\nfiles (e.g., `Enable-FocusAssist.ps1` , `Disable-FocusAssist.ps1` ).\n2. Run them under the **current user context** — they modify `HKCU`\nkeys, so they won’t affect other users unless run in their session.\n3. Automate with **Task Scheduler**:\n- **Action**: `powershell.exe`\n- **Arguments**: arduinoCopyEdit`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"C:\\Path\\To\\Enable-FocusAssist.ps1\"`\n4. You can also deploy them via login scripts or management tools like Intune or Group Policy Preferences.\n\n### Quick Reference Table\n\n| Scenario | Registry Key & Value | | --- | --- | | Enable Focus Assist (DND) | `NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_TOASTS_ENABLED = 0` | | Disable Focus Assist | `NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_TOASTS_ENABLED = 1` | | Fully disable (incl. Quiet Hours) | `QuietHoursActive = 0`<br>, `QuietHoursEnabled = 0`<br>, `NOC_GLOBAL_SETTING_DND = 0` |\n\n## The Payoff\n\nWith Task Scheduler and Focus Assist working in harmony, you’ll stop thinking about *when* to mute your notifications — and just enjoy the quiet. Your workflow becomes more predictable, your meetings less interrupted, and your evenings more peaceful.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/automating-your-digital-peace-quiet-hours-and-focus-assist/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/automating-your-digital-peace-quiet-hours-and-focus-assist/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/automating-your-digital-peace-quiet-hours-and-focus-assist/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/automating-your-digital-peace-quiet-hours-and-focus-assist/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/automating-your-digital-peace-quiet-hours-and-focus-assist/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2257)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Supercharge Your Debugging with Remote Tools for Microsoft Edge](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/edgedebugging.png?fit=619%2C663&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/supercharge-your-debugging-with-remote-tools-for-microsoft-edge/)\n\n[![Recover Deleted Files with Windows File Recovery A Lifesaver from Microsoft](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-1.png?fit=703%2C553&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/recover-deleted-files-with-windows-file-recovery-a-lifesaver-from-microsoft/)\n\n[![Unlocking the Power of Windows Event Viewer Usage, Benefits, and Troubleshooting Tips](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-2.png?fit=578%2C527&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/unlocking-the-power-of-windows-event-viewer-usage-benefits-and-troubleshooting-tips/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
