Enter **Microsoft 365 Copilot**, the AI-powered assistant transforming how teams plan, execute, and collaborate within **Microsoft Teams**.\n\n### Real-Time Meeting Support with the “Facilitator” Agent\n\nCopilot’s new **Facilitator agent** in Teams meetings takes real-time notes, transcribes discussions, and organizes content by topic and follow-up tasks. As the meeting unfolds, participants can co-edit notes, tag action items, and review outcomes in the Recap tab afterward—all stored securely in OneDrive. This feature frees teams to engage more deeply in conversations and align around next steps efficiently.\n\n### Project Automation with the “Project Manager” Agent\n\nManaging the details of multiple tasks just got easier with the **Project Manager agent** in Planner (within Teams). You can prompt it with your project goals, and it will auto-generate tasks, buckets, and a full plan—either starting from scratch or using templates. It tracks progress, assigns tasks (including to itself), flags items needing input, and supports content edits via comments. Integration with Whiteboard lets you convert brainstorming notes into actionable tasks.\n\n### What’s New in the Planner Experience\n\nSince April 2024, **Copilot in Planner (preview)** has become available to users with the appropriate Project Plan (3 or 5) licenses. It lets you generate full project plans, manage tasks naturally, and query updates on progress, due dates, and assignments—all via conversational prompts. The system continues to improve, with added support for subtasks, links to goals, and enhanced Q&A capabilities.\n\n### ⏰ Your AI Time and Project Management Advisor\n\nBy May 2025, Copilot had evolved into a powerful personal and team assistant, able to:\n\n- Interpret data from Outlook, Planner, Teams, and SharePoint\n- Turn emails and messages into organized to-do lists\n- Arrange priorities into **Must‑Do**, **Should‑Do**, and **Could‑Do** categories\n- Suggest ideal scheduling slots and even prompt breaks to combat burnout\n\nIt’s especially helpful for neurodivergent users—though invaluable to everyone.\n\n### Enterprise Impact: Measurable Productivity Gains\n\nA recent UK government trial involving 14,500 civil servants revealed that Copilot users saved an average of **26 minutes per day**, with entry-level employees saving up to **37 minutes**. The vast majority credited Copilot with reducing time spent on mundane tasks like information retrieval, and reported higher job satisfaction and better work–life balance.\n\n### Beyond Meetings: AI in Conversation and Content\n\nWithin Teams, Copilot now:\n\n- Summarizes chat threads, pinpoints decisions and tasks, and drafts follow-up communications\n- Offers a private Copilot panel in meetings to ask questions, request clarity, or get insights—without interrupting the discussion\n- Generates executive-style meeting summaries, highlights action items, and integrates with OneNote and Outlook for seamless follow-up\n\n### Why It Matters: Efficiency, Clarity, and Strategy\n\nAcross the board, Microsoft 365 Copilot:\n\n- Eases the burden of minute-taking, task tracking, and plan design so teams can focus on strategy\n- Seamlessly integrates AI-generated content into everyday workflows—be it planning, execution, or documentation\n- Cuts planning time dramatically: some workflows have dropped from eight hours to just two. Companies report up to **20% cost reduction** and ROI as high as **353%**\n\n**Microsoft 365 Copilot** is redefining project management in Teams—making it more interactive, efficient, and human-centered. It streamlines everything from meeting prep and follow-up to plan creation and communication, freeing teams to focus on creativity, collaboration, and strategy.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-microsoft-365-copilot-is-changing-project-management-in-teams/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-microsoft-365-copilot-is-changing-project-management-in-teams/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-microsoft-365-copilot-is-changing-project-management-in-teams/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-microsoft-365-copilot-is-changing-project-management-in-teams/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-microsoft-365-copilot-is-changing-project-management-in-teams/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2217)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![GPT‑5 Finally Arrives in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copiltoGPT.webp?fit=655%2C667&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/gpt%e2%80%915-finally-arrives-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n[![What Is Microsoft Copilot Studio?
