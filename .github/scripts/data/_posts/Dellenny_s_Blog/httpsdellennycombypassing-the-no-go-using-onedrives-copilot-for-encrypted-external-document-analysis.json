Tools like Copilot in OneDrive (part of the Microsoft 365 Copilot ecosystem) are designed to make that possible. But what happens when the documents are encrypted, or shared from outside your organisation? Often, that’s treated as a “no-go” zone for AI summarisation.\n\nThis blog explores how you *can* bypass the “no-go” — with the right permissions and controls — to enable Copilot to summarise **encrypted files** and **externally-shared files** (provided you have permission). We’ll dig into how it works, how to enable it safely, what the limitations are, and the advanced use-cases where this becomes truly powerful.\n\n## How Copilot in OneDrive Works (Quick Recap)\n\nCopilot in OneDrive allows you to ask questions about files stored in your OneDrive or files shared with you — without opening each file manually. It can summarise files such as Word, PDF, and PowerPoint, generate comparisons between documents, and create quick overviews or lists. Importantly, Copilot always honours access permissions; it can only process content that you have rights to view.\n\n## Unlocking Encrypted Document Analysis\n\n### What’s supported\n\nWhen a file is encrypted using Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels or Rights Management, Copilot can still access and summarise it — **if the user has the required VIEW and EXTRACT usage rights**. Files stored in SharePoint or OneDrive are encrypted at rest using enterprise-grade encryption standards, so data protection is maintained.\n\n### What’s constrained\n\nIf a sensitivity label grants only VIEW rights (without EXTRACT), Copilot cannot read or summarise the content. Some files with advanced encryption models, such as Double Key Encryption, are completely inaccessible to Copilot. The file must also be in a supported format (Word, PDF, PowerPoint, etc.) and within defined size limits.\n\n### Practical steps\n\n1. Use sensitivity labels that include **EXTRACT** rights for authorised users.\n2. Ensure the file is shared and stored in OneDrive or SharePoint, and the user has full viewing access.\n3. Select the file in OneDrive Web, open Copilot, and choose “Summarise this file.”\n4. For encrypted files, verify that IRM policies do not block Copilot’s summarisation feature.\n\n### Why this matters\n\nEncrypted documents often contain the most valuable content — legal agreements, compliance data, strategic reports. By allowing summarisation under controlled conditions, organisations can maintain governance while unlocking productivity gains.\n\n## Working with Externally Shared Documents\n\n### What works\n\nIf a document has been shared with you from outside your organisation — and you have the right permissions — Copilot can summarise it. It recognises files that you have access to via OneDrive or SharePoint and can summarise multiple files at once.\n\n### What to check\n\n- The document must be shared properly using specific-people or guest access permissions.\n- Encryption and protection rules applied by the sender’s organisation may restrict Copilot access.\n- The file must be a supported format and size.\n- For external sharing, use “specific people” links to ensure clarity on who can view and summarise.\n\n### Example scenario\n\nImagine a partner organisation shares a large market-research PDF with you. With the right permissions, you can open it in OneDrive Web, select Copilot, and request a summary or analysis of key findings. You can even compare that report to your internal strategy document — identifying overlaps, contradictions, or gaps.\n\n## Advanced Use-Cases & Best Practices\n\n### 1. **Cross-document summarisation across internal + external + encrypted files**\n\nYou can select multiple documents — internal, external, or encrypted — and ask Copilot to analyse them together. Example prompt:\n\n>\n> “Summarise the core obligations in the contract, highlight where our internal deck diverges from the partner’s research, and list any gaps we should address.”\n>\n\n### 2. **Governed external sharing and summarisation audit trail**\n\nUse Microsoft Purview auditing to track who summarised what, when, and from which location. Maintain logs of sharing permissions, label configurations, and summarisation actions.\n\n### 3. **Sharing summaries safely**\n\nSummaries can be distributed internally without sharing the original document. Ensure summaries are appropriately labelled or redacted to prevent exposure of sensitive content.\n\n### 4. **Folder- or project-level summarisation workflows**\n\nGroup all related project files — internal, external, encrypted — in a single OneDrive folder. Periodically summarise new additions using Copilot for project updates or stakeholder briefings.\n\n## Security & Governance Considerations\n\n- Configure sensitivity labels to grant EXTRACT rights where necessary.\n- Review external sharing policies regularly to maintain compliance.\n- Enable auditing to monitor Copilot usage and summarisation activity.\n- Educate users about rights management — Copilot respects access rules, but summarisation is possible if rights are granted.\n- Avoid overly broad sharing permissions such as “Everyone except external users.”\n- Ensure AI-driven summaries are reviewed for compliance before distribution.\n\nBy understanding how Copilot in OneDrive respects encryption and sharing permissions, you can safely extend summarisation to previously restricted “no-go” documents. This approach balances **productivity and compliance**, allowing you to derive insight from both internal and external content.\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. Review your sensitivity labels and ensure EXTRACT rights are configured.\n2. Audit external sharing policies.\n3. Test Copilot summarisation with mixed document sets.\n4. Incorporate summarisation into regular workflows like reviews or updates.\n\nWhen configured thoughtfully, OneDrive’s Copilot transforms from a simple storage assistant into a secure, insight-driven productivity engine.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/bypassing-the-no-go-using-onedrives-copilot-for-encrypted-external-document-analysis/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/bypassing-the-no-go-using-onedrives-copilot-for-encrypted-external-document-analysis/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/bypassing-the-no-go-using-onedrives-copilot-for-encrypted-external-document-analysis/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/bypassing-the-no-go-using-onedrives-copilot-for-encrypted-external-document-analysis/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/bypassing-the-no-go-using-onedrives-copilot-for-encrypted-external-document-analysis/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
