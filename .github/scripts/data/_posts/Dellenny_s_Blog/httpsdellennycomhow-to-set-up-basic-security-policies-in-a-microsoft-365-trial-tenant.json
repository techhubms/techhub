Even in a trial tenant, you’re working with powerful cloud services that, if left unprotected, could be vulnerable to unauthorized access or misuse.\n\nThe good news? Microsoft 365 comes with built-in tools that make it relatively easy to enforce best-practice security controls, even for beginners. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to set up foundational security policies in your Microsoft 365 trial tenant so you start off on the right foot.\n\n## **Why Security Setup Matters in a Trial Tenant**\n\nMany people treat trial tenants as temporary sandboxes and overlook security. But a few important things to remember:\n\n- A trial tenant is still hosted in Microsoft’s cloud—meaning it’s exposed to the internet.\n- Hackers often target new or unused trial tenants because they may have weak or default settings.\n- You might use the tenant for demos, POCs, labs, or client presentations, meaning real data may eventually end up inside.\n- Security policies you implement in a trial tenant can be easily replicated in a production environment later.\n\nBy taking a few minutes to configure your baseline protections, you’re laying the foundation for a secure Microsoft 365 environment—now and in the future.\n\n# **1. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**\n\nMFA is the single most important step to securing any cloud environment. Even if your trial tenant will only have a few users, enabling MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.\n\n### **How to Enable MFA**\n\nMicrosoft offers two primary options:\n\n### **Option A: Use Security Defaults (Recommended for Trials)**\n\nSecurity Defaults provide a simple, one-click way to enforce MFA across the tenant.\n\n1. Go to **Azure Active Directory / Entra ID Admin Center**.\n2. Navigate to **Properties**.\n3. Select **Manage Security Defaults**.\n4. Turn **Security Defaults** **On**.\n\nThis automatically enforces MFA and blocks legacy authentication protocols—both huge security wins.\n\n### **Option B: Use Conditional Access (for Trial Tenants with P2)**\n\nIf your trial includes Entra ID P1 or P2:\n\n1. Go to **Azure AD (Entra ID)** → **Security** → **Conditional Access**.\n2. Create a new policy:\n- **Assignments** → All Users\n- **Cloud apps** → All cloud apps\n- **Grant** → Require MFA\n3. Set the policy to **On**.\n\nThis method gives more flexibility but requires additional licensing.\n\n# **2. Block Legacy Authentication**\n\nLegacy authentication (like IMAP, POP, SMTP Basic) is one of the most common entry points for attackers. Even if you don’t use these protocols, they may still be enabled.\n\n### **How to Block Legacy Authentication**\n\nIf **Security Defaults** is enabled, this is already handled.\n\nIf using Conditional Access:\n\n1. Go to **Conditional Access** → **Create New Policy**.\n2. Assign to **All users**.\n3. Select **All cloud apps**.\n4. In the **Conditions** section → **Client apps** → check **Legacy Authentication**.\n5. In **Access Controls**, choose **Block Access** and enable the policy.\n\nThis one setting can eliminate a massive amount of risk.\n\n# **3. Set Up Baseline Conditional Access Policies**\n\nIf you have access to Conditional Access (P1 or P2), create the following basic policies:\n\n### **Basic Policies to Enable**\n\n- **Require MFA for Admins**\n- **Require MFA for All Users**\n- **Block Access from Outside Trusted Locations** (optional)\n- **Block Countries You Don’t Operate In** (optional)\n\nThese policies ensure you’re protecting both global admins and standard users.\n\nFor admin accounts in particular, requiring MFA is non-negotiable.\n\n# **4. Enable Defender for Office 365 Protection**\n\nEven in trial tenants, you can enable several Defender for Office 365 features to protect against phishing and malware.\n\n### **Key Policies to Configure**\n\n#### **Anti-Malware Policy**\n\n1. Go to **Microsoft 365 Defender Portal**.\n2. Navigate to **Email & Collaboration** → **Policies & Rules**.\n3. Edit the **Default anti-malware policy**.\n4. Turn on:\n- Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP)\n- Common attachment filtering\n- Malware detection response\n\n#### **Anti-Phishing Policy**\n\n1. Go to **Threat Policies** → **Anti-phishing**.\n2. Create a new policy or edit the default.\n3. Enable:\n- Spoof intelligence\n- Impersonation protection\n- Safe Links\n- Safe Attachments\n\nThese threat protection policies significantly enhance email security—which remains one of the most common attack vectors.\n\n# **5. Enforce Password Protection Settings**\n\nPassword policies are often overlooked, yet they play a crucial role in preventing brute-force attacks.\n\n### **Recommended Password Settings**\n\n- Enable password expiration (if required by your organization).\n- Enable banned-password lists using Microsoft’s intelligent protection.\n- Encourage or enforce the use of passwordless authentication (like Microsoft Authenticator).\n\nPasswordless is quickly becoming the modern best practice and is easily enabled through Entra ID → **Authentication Methods**.\n\n# **6. Set Up User Risk Policies (If Available)**\n\nIf your trial includes Azure AD Identity Protection:\n\n1. Go to **Entra ID** → **Identity Protection**.\n2. Configure:\n- **User risk policy** → Require password reset for medium+ risk.\n- **Sign-in risk policy** → Require MFA.\n- **Report-only mode** initially, then turn to **Enforce**.\n\nRisk-based conditional access adds adaptive security that automatically responds to suspicious activity.\n\n# **7. Review Admin Roles & Implement Least Privilege**\n\nTrial tenants often assign Global Admin to whoever signs up—but this is a bad habit. Instead:\n\n### **How to Improve Role Security**\n\n- Limit the number of Global Admin accounts (ideally two).\n- Use **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** if included.\n- Assign roles like Security Admin, Compliance Admin, or Teams Admin as needed rather than using GA for everything.\n\nLeast privilege is a best practice that reduces the blast radius if an account is compromised.\n\n# **8. Configure Security Alerts & Notifications**\n\nFinally, make sure you can actually *see* if something suspicious happens.\n\n### **Settings to Enable**\n\n- Sign-in risk alerts\n- Identity protection alerts\n- Email notifications from Defender\n- Audit logs\n- Unified audit logs in Purview (enable if needed)\n\nVisibility completes your security foundation.\n\nSetting up basic security in a Microsoft 365 trial tenant doesn’t have to be overwhelming. By enabling MFA, blocking legacy authentication, applying conditional access basics, and configuring Defender policies, you’re already ahead of many organizations that rush past security in the early stages.\n\nThese policies not only secure your trial tenant today but also help you build good habits for deploying Microsoft 365 in any production environment later.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-basic-security-policies-in-a-microsoft-365-trial-tenant/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-basic-security-policies-in-a-microsoft-365-trial-tenant/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-basic-security-policies-in-a-microsoft-365-trial-tenant/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-basic-security-policies-in-a-microsoft-365-trial-tenant/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-basic-security-policies-in-a-microsoft-365-trial-tenant/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3554)\n\nTags:[Microsoft 365](https://dellenny.com/tag/microsoft-365-2/ \"Microsoft 365\")\n\n[previousPrivacy and Compliance Standards (ISO, GDPR, HIPAA) in Microsoft 365](https://dellenny.com/privacy-and-compliance-standards-iso-gdpr-hipaa-in-microsoft-365/)\n\n[nextComparing Microsoft 365 to Google Workspace in 2025: Which Productivity Suite Is Right for You?](https://dellenny.com/comparing-microsoft-365-to-google-workspace-in-2025-which-productivity-suite-is-right-for-you/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3554)\n\n%d",
