  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content\n\n### 1. A Brand-New Look & Feel\n\n- **Modern, sleek interface**: Rounded corners, pastel accents, and fluid animations give Windows 11 a fresh, Mac-like aesthetic—far more refined than Windows 10’s traditional layout.\n- **Centered Start Menu & Taskbar**: By default, everything sits at the center—but you can revert to the classic left alignment if preferred.\n- **Simplified Start Menu**: Live Tiles are gone. Instead, you get a clean grid of static, pinned apps and “Recommended” content.\n\n## 2. Smarter Multitasking & Productivity\n\n- **Snap Layouts & Groups**: Instead of manually snapping windows, you now have preset layouts and groups you can recall with a hover over the taskbar.\n- **Virtual Desktops**: Improved animations and personalization—assign different backgrounds to desktops for work, gaming, etc.\n- **File Explorer Tabs & Smart Suggestions**: You can manage multiple folders in one window, and File Explorer now surfaces intelligent recommendations based on your usage.\n- **Enhanced Snipping Tool**: Supports text extraction, redaction, and even screen recording.\n\n## 3. Performance, Gaming, & Hardware Improvements\n\n- **Gaming Boosts**: Windows 11 introduces Auto HDR and leverages DirectStorage to accelerate game loading, alongside full DirectX 12 support.\n- **Modernized Microsoft Store**: Revamped design with support for a broader range of apps including Android apps via the Amazon Appstore.\n\n## 4. Security Enhancements\n\n- **TPM 2.0 & Secure Boot**: Windows 11 requires TPM 2.0 and enhanced Secure Boot, significantly raising the bar for system security.\n- **Windows Hello, Passkeys & Smart App Control**: Biometric sign-in is more robust, with a new passkey system for seamless app login. Smart App Control ensures only trusted apps run.\n\n## 5. Built-in AI & Productivity Tools\n\n- **Microsoft Copilot & AI Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions surface in File Explorer, Start Menu, and taskbar. Copilot helps with content creation, task automation, and more.\n- **Phone Link for iPhone**: Windows 11 supports connecting your iPhone to your PC—call, text, and get notifications without picking up your phone.\n\n## 6. Better Touch, Voice & Accessibility Features\n\n- **Adaptive Touch Interface**: Windows 11 eliminates tablet mode. Instead, it adjusts UI based on usage—bigger targets and split views for touchscreens.\n- **Voice Typing & Custom Keyboards**: Improved voice-to-text capabilities and customizable touch keyboard themes and sizes.\n- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Includes better Narrator with natural speech, customizable contrast themes, and improved color control.\n\n## 7. Support, Stability, and the Road Ahead\n\n- **End of Windows 10 Support**: Windows 10 support ends October 14, 2025. After that, it will no longer receive security patches.\n- **Widespread Adoption**: Windows 11 has now overtaken Windows 10 in desktop market share.\n- **Ongoing Enhancements**:\n- **PowerToys Updates**: Scheduled theme switching and shortcut conflict detection are being added.\n- **Improved Bluetooth Audio**: Windows 11 now supports stereo LE Audio—better gaming and call quality.\n- **Visual Tweaks**: The BSOD is now black, with clearer info and Quick Machine Recovery to help recover from crashes.\n- **24H2 Feature Drop**: Adds Wi-Fi 7 support, live captions with translation, proactive security, and a scrollable Quick Settings list.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-whats-new-compared-to-windows-10/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-whats-new-compared-to-windows-10/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-whats-new-compared-to-windows-10/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-whats-new-compared-to-windows-10/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-whats-new-compared-to-windows-10/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2544)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Intel HAXM vs. Hyper-V/WHPX Choosing the Right Setup for Android Emulator on Windows](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/intelhyperv.webp?fit=724%2C718&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/)\n\n[![How to Use Hyper-V with BitLocker Without Constant Recovery Prompts](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bitlockerhyperv.webp?fit=774%2C765&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-hyper-v-with-bitlocker-without-constant-recovery-prompts/)\n\n[![Optimizing Windows 11 for Gaming Performance](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11gaming.webp?fit=770%2C771&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-windows-11-for-gaming-performance/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
