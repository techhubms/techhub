These customizable, glanceable panels provide quick access to news, weather, calendar events, and more—all in one place. If you’re new to Windows 11 or just exploring how to make the most of Widgets, this guide covers everything you need to know.\n\n## What Are Widgets in Windows 11?\n\nWidgets are small, interactive panels that display personalized information powered by Microsoft services. Think of them as a dashboard—combining productivity tools, entertainment, and updates from the web into a single view.\n\nYou can access Widgets directly from the taskbar by clicking the **Widgets icon** (a square divided into four quadrants) or by using the keyboard shortcut **Win + W**.\n\n## Key Features of Widgets\n\n- **Personalized Feed**: Curated news, weather updates, sports scores, and finance information.\n- **Productivity Tools**: Calendar, To Do list, traffic updates, and reminders.\n- **Microsoft 365 Integration**: See recent documents and activities across devices.\n- **Customizable Layouts**: Pin, rearrange, and resize widgets to suit your needs.\n- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Widgets learn from your activity to provide more relevant updates.\n\n## How to Access Widgets\n\n1. **From the Taskbar**: Click the Widgets button (four-panel icon).\n2. **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press **Win + W**.\n3. **Touchscreen Devices**: Swipe from the left edge of the screen.\n\n## Managing Widgets\n\n### Adding and Removing Widgets\n\n- Open the Widgets board.\n- Click the **“+” button** in the top-right corner.\n- Browse the available widgets and select the ones you want to add.\n- To remove a widget, click the three-dot menu on its top-right corner and select **Remove widget**.\n\n### Customizing Widgets\n\n- Click the **three-dot menu** on a widget.\n- Adjust size: choose small, medium, or large.\n- Personalize settings: change the location for weather, pick favorite sports teams, or follow stock tickers.\n\n## Customizing the News Feed\n\nThe news feed below the widgets is powered by **Microsoft Start**. You can:\n\n- Click the **Personalize your interests** link to fine-tune topics.\n- Follow or unfollow publishers.\n- Give feedback on stories (thumbs up/down) to improve recommendations.\n\n## Productivity with Widgets\n\nWidgets aren’t just about news—they can help streamline your day:\n\n- **Calendar**: Keep track of upcoming events.\n- **Tasks**: Sync your Microsoft To Do list.\n- **Traffic**: Get live commuting updates.\n- **Photos**: View recent images from OneDrive.\n\n## Tips for Using Widgets Effectively\n\n- Pin the widgets you use most often at the top.\n- Resize widgets for quick scanning (e.g., keep Weather small, Calendar large).\n- Regularly personalize your feed to keep content relevant.\n- Use Widgets on touchscreen devices for quick swiping and glancing.\n\n## Limitations of Widgets\n\nWhile useful, Widgets in Windows 11 have some limitations:\n\n- Only supports Microsoft’s ecosystem (Outlook, OneDrive, Edge).\n- Limited third-party widget options (though more may be added in future updates).\n- Requires internet connectivity for most features.\n\n## The Future of Widgets in Windows 11\n\nMicrosoft continues to refine Widgets, with more personalization, third-party integrations, and productivity-focused features expected in future updates. As Windows 11 evolves, Widgets are likely to become a central hub for information and quick tasks.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/the-complete-guide-to-widgets-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/the-complete-guide-to-widgets-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/the-complete-guide-to-widgets-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/the-complete-guide-to-widgets-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/the-complete-guide-to-widgets-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2611)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Top 10 Windows 11 Tips Every Beginner Should Know](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11starttoptips.webp?fit=708%2C726&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/)\n\n[![Moving from Office 2016/2019 to Microsoft 365: What Changes?](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moving2019.webp?fit=724%2C701&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/)\n\n[![How to Reconfigure the Hidden Context Menu and Unlock Power Tweaks in Windows](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11contextmenu.webp?fit=709%2C703&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
