This is where **GitHub Copilot** comes in. Acting as your AI pair programmer inside Visual Studio or VS Code, Copilot suggests context-aware code snippets, tests, and even full method implementations.\n\nLet’s dive into **real-world .NET coding examples** that highlight how Copilot can make you more productive.\n\n## 1. Quickly Generating ASP.NET Core Controllers\n\nBuilding REST APIs in ASP.NET Core often involves repetitive patterns. Copilot can generate these structures with minimal typing.\n\n**Example: A Basic Products Controller**\n\n``` using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\n\n[ApiController] [Route(\"api/[controller]\")] public class ProductsController : ControllerBase { private readonly IProductService _productService;\n\npublic ProductsController(IProductService productService) { _productService = productService; }\n\n[HttpGet] public IActionResult GetAll() { return Ok(_productService.GetAllProducts()); }\n\n[HttpGet(\"{id}\")] public IActionResult GetById(int id) { var product = _productService.GetProductById(id); if (product == null) return NotFound(); return Ok(product); } }\n\n```\n\nCopilot can scaffold out controllers with routes, parameter handling, and `IActionResult` responses, saving you from rewriting the same code across multiple controllers.\n\n## 2. Entity Framework Data Models\n\nDefining data models with Entity Framework involves repetitive property definitions. Copilot can infer these patterns based on your naming conventions.\n\n**Example: Product Entity**\n\n``` public class Product { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty; public decimal Price { get; set; } public int Stock { get; set; } public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; } = DateTime.UtcNow; }\n\n```\n\nAs soon as you start typing `public class Product` , Copilot can suggest standard fields like `Id` , `Name` , and `Price` , accelerating your model design.\n\n## 3. Writing Unit Tests Faster with xUnit\n\nTesting in .NET is crucial but can be repetitive. Copilot can generate common test cases quickly.\n\n**Example: Unit Tests for ProductService**\n\n``` using Xunit;\n\npublic class ProductServiceTests { [Fact] public void AddProduct_ShouldIncreaseCount() { var service = new ProductService(); var initialCount = service.GetAllProducts().Count;\n\nservice.AddProduct(new Product { Name = \"Test\", Price = 10.0m });\n\nAssert.Equal(initialCount + 1, service.GetAllProducts().Count); }\n\n[Fact] public void GetProductById_ShouldReturnNull_WhenNotFound() { var service = new ProductService(); var result = service.GetProductById(999); Assert.Null(result); } }\n\n```\n\nInstead of manually writing boilerplate test cases, Copilot can generate meaningful `Arrange-Act-Assert` style tests, which you can refine.\n\n## 4. Auto-Generating LINQ Queries\n\nWriting LINQ can be verbose, but Copilot often suggests correct query syntax once it understands your intent.\n\n**Example: LINQ Filtering**\n\n``` var expensiveProducts = products .Where(p => p.Price > 100) .OrderByDescending(p => p.Price) .ToList();\n\n```\n\nTyping `var expensiveProducts = products.` often prompts Copilot to complete the filtering logic, saving mental overhead.\n\n## 5. Documentation and XML Comments\n\nCopilot can generate XML doc comments for methods, which improves maintainability and IntelliSense support.\n\n**Example: Auto-Generated Doc Comment**\n\n``` /// <summary> /// Calculates the discount price for a product. /// </summary> /// <param name=\"price\">The original price.</param> /// <param name=\"percentage\">The discount percentage.</param> /// <returns>The price after discount.</returns> public decimal CalculateDiscount(decimal price, decimal percentage) { return price - (price * (percentage / 100)); }\n\n```\n\nInstead of writing XML comments manually, start typing `///` and Copilot will suggest structured documentation.\n\n## Best Practices for Using Copilot in .NET\n\n- **Validate suggestions**: AI is helpful, but always check for correctness and performance implications.\n- **Use Copilot for scaffolding**: Great for controllers, services, tests, and boilerplate—but refine logic yourself.\n- **Pair it with .NET tooling**: Combine Copilot with tools like **Entity Framework migrations** and **ASP.NET scaffolding** for maximum productivity.\n\nGitHub Copilot can be a powerful partner in .NET development, helping you focus on solving business problems instead of rewriting boilerplate code. From **ASP.NET Core controllers** to **Entity Framework models** and **xUnit tests**, Copilot streamlines repetitive coding tasks, leaving you more time for creativity and innovation.\n\nIf you haven’t yet, give Copilot a try in your .NET workflow—it might just become your favorite coding assistant.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/boosting-productivity-with-github-copilot-real-world-net-coding-examples/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/boosting-productivity-with-github-copilot-real-world-net-coding-examples/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/boosting-productivity-with-github-copilot-real-world-net-coding-examples/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/boosting-productivity-with-github-copilot-real-world-net-coding-examples/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/boosting-productivity-with-github-copilot-real-world-net-coding-examples/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2320)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How GitHub Copilot Helps with Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/githubTDD.webp?fit=727%2C772&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-github-copilot-helps-with-test-driven-development-tdd/)\n\n[![Creating Custom Plugins and Connectors in Copilot Studio](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copilotstudio2.webp?fit=712%2C696&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/creating-custom-plugins-and-connectors-in-copilot-studio/)\n\n[![Integrating Copilot Studio with Power Automate for End-to-End Workflows](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copilotpowerautomate.webp?fit=743%2C775&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/integrating-copilot-studio-with-power-automate-for-end-to-end-workflows/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
