Among these, widgets stand out as a convenient way to get quick access to important information at a glance. Whether you want to check the weather, stay on top of news, or manage your calendar, Windows 11 widgets make it simple. In this post, we’ll explore the **best Windows 11 widgets** and show you **how to add them** to your system.\n\n## Best Windows 11 Widgets\n\nHere are some of the most useful widgets available in Windows 11:\n\n### 1. **Weather Widget**\n\nStay updated on local weather conditions and forecasts right from your desktop. It’s one of the most popular widgets for quick daily planning.\n\n### 2. **Calendar Widget**\n\nSyncs with your Outlook or Microsoft 365 calendar, helping you keep track of meetings, appointments, and reminders.\n\n### 3. **To-Do Widget**\n\nIdeal for productivity, this widget integrates with Microsoft To Do so you can manage your tasks and checklists directly from the Widgets board.\n\n### 4. **Traffic Widget**\n\nPerfect for commuters, this widget shows local traffic conditions and estimated travel times to help you plan your route.\n\n### 5. **Sports Widget**\n\nFollow your favorite teams and leagues with live scores, schedules, and news updates.\n\n### 6. **Watchlist & Finance Widget**\n\nFor investors, this widget provides stock market updates, cryptocurrency values, and company news.\n\n### 7. **Entertainment & News Widget**\n\nStay up to date with trending stories, headlines, and entertainment updates from your preferred sources.\n\n### 8. **Photos Widget**\n\nThis pulls in memories and recent pictures from your OneDrive, letting you relive moments right on your desktop.\n\n## How to Add Widgets in Windows 11\n\nAdding and customizing widgets in Windows 11 is simple. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the Widgets board**:\n- Click on the **Widgets icon** on the taskbar (a square divided into sections).\n- Or press **Win + W**.\n2. **Add a new widget**:\n- In the Widgets board, scroll down and click **Add widgets**.\n- Choose from the list of available widgets (Weather, Calendar, To-Do, Sports, etc.).\n3. **Customize your widget**:\n- Click the **three-dot menu** (⋮) on the widget.\n- Select **Customize widget**.\n- Adjust settings such as location (for weather), favorite teams (for sports), or sources (for news).\n4. **Resize or rearrange widgets**:\n- Use the resize option in the widget menu to make it small, medium, or large.\n- Drag and drop widgets to rearrange them within the board.\n\nWidgets in Windows 11 are a fantastic way to personalize your desktop and stay informed without constantly switching between apps.
