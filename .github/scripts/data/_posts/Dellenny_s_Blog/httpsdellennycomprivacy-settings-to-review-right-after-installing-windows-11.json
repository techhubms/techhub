But Microsoft’s default settings often lean toward data collection and personalization, which may not align with your privacy preferences. By taking a few minutes to review and adjust your settings, you can better protect your personal data, reduce tracking, and control how much information your computer shares with Microsoft and third parties.\n\nHere are the key **privacy settings you should review immediately after installing Windows 11**:\n\n## 1. **Diagnostics & Feedback**\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Diagnostics & Feedback**.\n- By default, Windows sends diagnostic data to Microsoft. You can:\n- Set **Diagnostic Data** to *Required only*.\n- Turn off **Tailored experiences** to prevent personalized ads and tips based on your usage.\n- Disable **Improve inking & typing** if you don’t want Microsoft collecting typing data.\n\n## 2. **Advertising ID**\n\n- Navigate to **Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; General**.\n- Turn off **Let apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID**.\n- This stops apps from building a profile of you for targeted advertising.\n\n## 3. **Activity History**\n\n- In **Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Activity history**, uncheck **Store my activity history on this device** and **Send my activity history to Microsoft**.\n- This prevents Windows from tracking and syncing your app and browsing activity.\n\n## 4. **Location Settings**\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Location**.\n- If you don’t use location-based apps, turn **Location services** off entirely.\n- If you need location occasionally, limit access to specific apps instead of allowing all apps.\n\n## 5. **App Permissions**\n\nWindows 11 gives apps access to sensitive hardware and data by default. Review permissions under **Settings &gt; Privacy & Security** and check each category (Camera, Microphone, Contacts, Calendar, etc.):\n\n- Disable access for apps that don’t need it.\n- For example, keep your microphone and camera off unless actively used by video conferencing or recording apps.\n\n## 6. **Speech, Inking & Typing**\n\n- In **Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Speech**, turn off **Online speech recognition** unless you rely on voice dictation.\n- Under **Inking & Typing personalization**, disable personalization if you don’t want Microsoft learning your typing style.\n\n## 7. **Find My Device**\n\n- In **Settings &gt; Privacy & Security &gt; Find my device**, disable it if you don’t want your location tracked.\n- If you use a laptop and travel often, you may want to keep it on for recovery purposes.\n\n## 8. **Microsoft Account & OneDrive Syncing**\n\n- During setup, Windows pushes you to use a Microsoft account and sync files with OneDrive.\n- If privacy is your priority, consider:\n- Using a **local account** (you can switch after setup).\n- Turning off **OneDrive sync** for folders you don’t want stored in the cloud.\n\n## 9. **Edge Browser Privacy**\n\nIf you use Microsoft Edge:\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Privacy, search, and services**.\n- Set **Tracking prevention** to *Strict*.\n- Turn off **Personalized ads, shopping, and search suggestions**.\n- Clear browsing data regularly or set it to clear on exit.\n\nWindows 11 can be customized to respect your privacy more, but it requires a little upfront effort. By reviewing these settings right after installation, you take control over your personal data instead of letting Microsoft’s defaults decide for you.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/privacy-settings-to-review-right-after-installing-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/privacy-settings-to-review-right-after-installing-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/privacy-settings-to-review-right-after-installing-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/privacy-settings-to-review-right-after-installing-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/privacy-settings-to-review-right-after-installing-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2346)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Set Up Hyper-V Virtual Machines in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hyperv.webp?fit=745%2C741&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Syncing Your Android Phone with Windows 11 Using Phone Link](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11andorid.webp?fit=767%2C751&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/syncing-your-android-phone-with-windows-11-using-phone-link/)\n\n[![How to Join and Use the Windows Insider Program](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wininsider.webp?fit=746%2C777&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-join-and-use-the-windows-insider-program/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
