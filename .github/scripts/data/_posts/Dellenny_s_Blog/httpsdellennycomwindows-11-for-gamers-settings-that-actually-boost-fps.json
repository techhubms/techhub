The good news? Most of these changes don’t require third-party software—they’re built right into Windows. Let’s walk through the settings that actually make a difference.\n\n## 1. Enable Game Mode\n\nGame Mode is Microsoft’s built-in performance booster. It prioritizes gaming processes and reduces background tasks.\n\n- **How to enable:**\n- Press `Win + I`\n→ *Settings* → *Gaming* → *Game Mode*.\n- Toggle it **On**.\n\nThis ensures your CPU and GPU aren’t distracted by system updates or background processes while you’re in-game.\n\n## 2. Turn On Hardware-Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS)\n\nHAGS reduces latency by offloading some GPU tasks directly to your graphics card instead of your CPU.\n\n- **How to enable:**\n- `Win + I`\n→ *System* → *Display* → *Graphics* → *Default graphics settings*.\n- Toggle **Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** to **On**.\n- Restart your PC.\n\nThis can improve smoothness, especially in GPU-heavy games.\n\n## 3. Use the Right Power Plan\n\nWindows defaults to a “Balanced” power plan, but for gaming, you want **High Performance** or **Ultimate Performance**.\n\n- **How to enable:**\n- `Win + R`\n→ type `powercfg.cpl` .\n- Select **High Performance** or create a custom plan.\n- If available, enable **Ultimate Performance** with: `powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61`\n\nThis prevents your CPU from downclocking during intense gameplay.\n\n## 4. Tweak Your Graphics Settings Per Game\n\nWindows 11 lets you assign GPU preferences per application. Perfect if you have a laptop with both integrated and dedicated GPUs.\n\n- **How to enable:**\n- *Settings* → *System* → *Display* → *Graphics*.\n- Select your game → *Options* → Choose **High performance** (dedicated GPU).\n\nNo more wasted frames on integrated graphics.\n\n## 5. Disable Background Apps You Don’t Need\n\nMany apps run in the background and eat resources without you noticing.\n\n- **How to disable:**\n- *Settings* → *Apps* → *Installed apps*.\n- Review what starts up automatically and disable what you don’t need.\n- Alternatively, go to *Task Manager* → *Startup Apps* → disable unnecessary ones.\n\nEvery freed-up resource translates to more consistent FPS.\n\n## 6. Enable Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)\n\nIf your monitor supports VRR (like FreeSync or G-Sync), enabling it reduces screen tearing and stutter.\n\n- **How to enable:**\n- *Settings* → *System* → *Display* → *Graphics* → *Default graphics settings*.\n- Toggle **Variable refresh rate** on.\n\nThis works best on supported hardware and modern games.\n\n## 7. Keep Your Drivers Updated\n\nThe most overlooked performance boost is simply keeping your **GPU drivers** updated. Both NVIDIA and AMD release frequent updates tailored to new games.\n\n- For **NVIDIA**: Use *GeForce Experience*.\n- For **AMD**: Use *Radeon Software Adrenalin*.\n\nDriver updates can mean double-digit FPS gains in new titles.\n\n## 8. Optional: Disable Visual Effects\n\nWindows 11 is pretty, but those animations eat resources.\n\n- **How to disable:**\n- *Settings* → *System* → *About* → *Advanced system settings*.\n- Under *Performance*, click *Settings*.\n- Choose **Adjust for best performance** or selectively disable animations.\n\nIf you want raw performance, this helps—especially on older hardware.\n\nWindows 11 is gamer-friendly by default, but with the right tweaks, you can reduce input lag, stabilize frame rates, and get smoother gameplay. Game Mode, GPU scheduling, and VRR alone can make a noticeable difference, while power plans and driver updates give you the consistency you need.\n\nWhether you’re running the latest AAA title or grinding competitive matches, these settings ensure you’re not leaving performance on the table.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-for-gamers-settings-that-actually-boost-fps/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-for-gamers-settings-that-actually-boost-fps/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-for-gamers-settings-that-actually-boost-fps/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-for-gamers-settings-that-actually-boost-fps/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-for-gamers-settings-that-actually-boost-fps/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2716)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Using BitLocker to Encrypt Your Files in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bitlocker.webp?fit=713%2C699&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/using-bitlocker-to-encrypt-your-files-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Windows 11 Privacy Settings You Should Change Right Now](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11privacysettingChange.webp?fit=714%2C691&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-privacy-settings-you-should-change-right-now/)\n\n[![Creating Custom Themes &amp; Wallpapers in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11Themes.webp?fit=715%2C696&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/creating-custom-themes-wallpapers-in-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
