Replace it.‚Äù*\n\nThis post explores how to implement immutable infrastructure on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to build resilient, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems.\n\n## üß± What Is Immutable Infrastructure?\n\nIn a traditional (mutable) infrastructure model, servers are updated in place‚Äîhotfixes are applied, patches are installed, and configurations are modified directly on running systems. This approach creates **configuration drift**, **inconsistencies**, and often **production errors** that are hard to reproduce or debug.\n\nIn contrast, **immutable infrastructure** treats all compute resources (EC2, containers, etc.) as **disposable artifacts**. If you need to make a change, you **build a new image**, **deploy new instances**, and **terminate the old ones**.\n\n> >\n> ‚úÖ *Think of infrastructure like versioned code artifacts‚Äînever edited directly, always rebuilt and redeployed.*\n> >\n\n## üöÄ Why Use Immutable Infrastructure?\n\n- **Consistency** ‚Äì Every environment is built from the same versioned artifact.\n- **Speed** ‚Äì Easier automation and faster rollback.\n- **Security** ‚Äì No SSH access, no configuration drift.\n- **Reliability** ‚Äì Predictable deployments reduce surprises.\n- **Auditability** ‚Äì Every change is version-controlled and logged.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Implementing Immutable Infrastructure on AWS\n\nHere‚Äôs how you can bring the immutable pattern to life using AWS-native services.\n\n### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build Custom Machine Images (AMIs)\n\nStart by creating **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)** with your application, dependencies, and configuration baked in.\n\n#### üì¶ Tools You Can Use:\n\n- **Packer** ‚Äì Automates AMI creation.\n- **EC2 Image Builder** ‚Äì AWS-native image pipeline.\n- **Docker** ‚Äì If deploying containerized workloads.\n\n#### Example: Create AMI using Packer\n\n``` jsonCopyEdit{ \"builders\": [ { \"type\": \"amazon-ebs\", \"region\": \"us-east-1\", \"source_ami\": \"ami-12345678\", \"instance_type\": \"t2.micro\", \"ssh_username\": \"ec2-user\", \"ami_name\": \"myapp-{{timestamp}}\" } ], \"provisioners\": [ { \"type\": \"shell\", \"inline\": [ \"sudo yum update -y\", \"sudo yum install -y nginx\", \"sudo systemctl enable nginx\" ] } ] }\n\n```\n\n### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Store and Version Images\n\nPush your AMIs to **Amazon EC2 AMI catalog** or **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** (for Docker-based apps). Use semantic versioning or timestamps for traceability.\n\n### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy via Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)\n\nUse **EC2 Auto Scaling Groups** with **Launch Templates** referencing your custom AMI. Whenever there‚Äôs a new version:\n\n- Update the launch template with the new AMI ID.\n- Trigger a rolling update.\n\n#### Rolling Replacement Strategy:\n\n- `MinSize = N`\n- `MaxSize = 2N`\n- Create N new instances\n- Drain and terminate old instances\n\nüõë **Avoid in-place updates.** ASGs can automatically terminate old instances after launching new ones.\n\n### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Blue-Green or Canary Deployments (Optional)\n\nTo reduce risk:\n\n- Use **Blue-Green Deployment**: deploy the new version alongside the old, switch traffic using **Elastic Load Balancer**.\n- Use **Canary Deployment**: direct a small percentage of traffic to the new environment before full rollout.\n\nTools to help:\n\n- **AWS CodeDeploy** with Blue/Green support for EC2 and ECS\n- **Elastic Beanstalk** Blue/Green Deployments\n- **Application Load Balancer** weighted target groups\n\n### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Automate Everything with CI/CD\n\nUse **AWS CodePipeline** or **GitHub Actions** to automate:\n\n1. Build the app\n2. Create a new AMI (or container image)\n3. Update infrastructure via **CloudFormation** or **Terraform**\n4. Replace old instances\n\nExample CI/CD Flow:\n\n``` plaintextCopyEditCode Commit ‚Üí Build AMI (Packer) ‚Üí Push to EC2 ‚Üí Update Launch Template ‚Üí Trigger ASG Rolling Update ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Promote\n\n```\n\n## üí° Optional Enhancements\n\n- Use **Amazon EC2 Image Builder** for native image automation.\n- Use **Amazon SSM** for remote commands if needed (without SSH).\n- Use **Immutable ECS Tasks** for container workloads.\n\n## ‚öñÔ∏è Mutable vs Immutable: Quick Comparison\n\n| Feature | Mutable | Immutable | | --- | --- | --- | | Update Strategy | In-place changes | Rebuild and replace | | Configuration Drift | Common | None | | Debugging | Manual SSH | Reproducible builds | | Rollbacks | Complex | Easy (redeploy previous image) | | Automation | Harder | Easier | | Consistency | Low | High |\n\n## ‚úÖ Best Practices\n\n- **Never SSH into production instances**. Use logs, metrics, and monitoring instead.\n- **Tag AMIs and resources** with build metadata.\n- **Test images** before deployment (use staging environments).\n- Use **CloudWatch Alarms** and **AWS Config** to detect unauthorized changes.\n- Consider **ECS with Fargate** or **Lambda** for fully serverless immutability.\n\nAdopting the **Immutable Infrastructure** pattern is a significant step toward modern, reliable, and maintainable systems. On AWS, you have all the tools you need to implement this pattern efficiently and safely.\n\nBy baking your applications into machine images, deploying through automation, and treating infrastructure as disposable, you eliminate many of the issues that plague mutable environments.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2187)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Building Resilient Systems with Immutable Infrastructure on Azure](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/azurecloud.webp?fit=716%2C674&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/)\n\n[![Secret Store Pattern in AWS Using Secure Vaults for Credentials and Secrets](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/awspatterns.webp?fit=676%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/)\n\n[![Secret Store Pattern in Azure Using Secure Vaults for Credentials and Secrets](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Secret-Store-Patternazure.webp?fit=700%2C706&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-azure-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d"
