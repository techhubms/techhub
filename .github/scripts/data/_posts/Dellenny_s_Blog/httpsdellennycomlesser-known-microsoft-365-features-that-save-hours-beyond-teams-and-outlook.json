But beneath the surface, Microsoft 365 is packed with lesser-known features that can shave hours off your week—if you know where to look.\n\nHere are some of the hidden gems worth exploring, along with quick “how to” steps so you can try them immediately.\n\n## 1. Quick Steps in Outlook\n\nTired of repeating the same tasks in your inbox? **Quick Steps** let you create one-click automations.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. In Outlook, go to the **Home tab**.\n2. Find the **Quick Steps** group in the ribbon.\n3. Click **Create New** and choose actions (e.g., *move to folder + mark as read*).\n4. Give it a name and assign a shortcut if you like.\n\nNow, one click (or keystroke) handles multi-step tasks.\n\n## 2. Power Automate (Built Right In)\n\n**Power Automate** creates workflows across Microsoft 365 and beyond.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Go to flow.microsoft.com or open **Power Automate** from the app launcher.\n2. Choose **Templates** (like “Save Outlook attachments to OneDrive”).\n3. Sign in to the connected apps (Outlook, OneDrive, Teams, etc.).\n4. Click **Create Flow**—done.\n\nNo coding required.\n\n## 3. Editor: More Than Spellcheck\n\n**Microsoft Editor** helps refine writing beyond spelling and grammar.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. In **Word or Outlook**, go to the **Review tab**.\n2. Click **Editor** to see suggestions.\n3. Use filters to focus on *Clarity, Conciseness, or Formality*.\n\nTip: Install the **Microsoft Editor browser extension** for real-time writing feedback online.\n\n## 4. Dictation Across Apps\n\nDictation lets you speak instead of typing in Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Open a document or email.\n2. Go to the **Home tab**.\n3. Click **Dictate** (microphone icon).\n4. Start speaking—your words appear instantly.\n\nYou can even use commands like “new paragraph” or “delete that.”\n\n## 5. OneNote Tags & Search\n\nOneNote is more powerful when you use **tags** for tasks and ideas.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Highlight text in OneNote.\n2. Press **Ctrl + 1** (To-Do tag) or pick another tag from the **Home tab**.\n3. Later, go to **Find Tags** (top-right) to see all tagged items across notebooks.\n\nPerfect for meeting notes that turn into actionable tasks.\n\n## 6. Excel’s Data Types & Analyze Data\n\nExcel’s new **data types** and AI tools unlock richer insights.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Type text like “France” or “Apple” in a cell.\n2. Select the cells, then choose **Data &gt; Data Types** (e.g., *Geography, Stocks*).\n3. A small icon appears—click it for live data fields.\n4. For insights, go to **Home &gt; Analyze Data** and ask plain questions like “Top 5 products by revenue.”\n\n## 7. Loop Components\n\nLoop keeps content live and collaborative inside Outlook or Teams.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. In Teams chat or Outlook email, click the **Loop icon** (looks like a swirl).\n2. Choose a component (Table, Checklist, Paragraph, etc.).\n3. Insert it—everyone can edit the same content in real time.\n\nNo more “final\\_v2\\_revised” file chaos.\n\n## 8. Presenter Coach in PowerPoint\n\n**Presenter Coach** helps you rehearse with real feedback.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Open your slide deck in PowerPoint.\n2. Go to the **Slide Show tab**.\n3. Click **Rehearse with Coach**.\n4. Speak through your presentation—feedback shows up live and in a report after.\n\nGreat for catching filler words or pacing issues before going live.\n\n## 9. Bookings with Me\n\nSkip the back-and-forth when scheduling.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Go to Bookings with Me.\n2. Set up your meeting types (e.g., 30-min call, 1-hour consult).\n3. Share your personal booking link.\n4. People pick a time, and it syncs with your Outlook calendar.\n\n## 10. Whiteboard (Now Collaborative Everywhere)\n\nMicrosoft Whiteboard is now a full **collaborative canvas**.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. Open **Microsoft Whiteboard** app or go to whiteboard.office.com.\n2. Click **New Whiteboard**.\n3. Add sticky notes, text, images, or drawings.\n4. Share with your team for real-time collaboration.\n\nPerfect for brainstorming beyond a static slide.\n\nThe best part about Microsoft 365 is that these features are **already included** in most business subscriptions—you don’t need new tools or extra licenses. By leaning on them, you can replace tedious tasks with smarter, faster workflows.\n\nNext time you open your Microsoft 365 apps, explore beyond the basics—you might just find hours of your week waiting to be reclaimed.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/lesser-known-microsoft-365-features-that-save-hours-beyond-teams-and-outlook/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/lesser-known-microsoft-365-features-that-save-hours-beyond-teams-and-outlook/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/lesser-known-microsoft-365-features-that-save-hours-beyond-teams-and-outlook/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/lesser-known-microsoft-365-features-that-save-hours-beyond-teams-and-outlook/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/lesser-known-microsoft-365-features-that-save-hours-beyond-teams-and-outlook/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2469)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How Nonprofits Can Maximize Microsoft 365 Donations](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365nonprofit.webp?fit=749%2C747&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-nonprofits-can-maximize-microsoft-365-donations/)\n\n[![Microsoft 365 for Education Best Practices for Teachers](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365teachers.webp?fit=768%2C782&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-for-education-best-practices-for-teachers/)\n\n[![Creating Custom Microsoft Teams Apps and Tabs](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Creating-custom-Teams-apps-and-tabs.webp?fit=740%2C731&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/creating-custom-microsoft-teams-apps-and-tabs/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
