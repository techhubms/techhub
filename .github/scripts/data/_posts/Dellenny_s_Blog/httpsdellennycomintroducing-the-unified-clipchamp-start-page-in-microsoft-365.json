Built with modern storytelling in mind, it’s ideal for professionals who need high-quality videos without the complexity of traditional editing software.\n\n### Clipchamp Highlights:\n\n- Drag-and-drop editing with an intuitive timeline\n- Pre-built templates for business, education, and marketing\n- Screen and webcam recording\n- Text overlays, transitions, and branding tools\n- AI voiceovers and auto-captioning features\n- Seamless cloud saving via OneDrive or SharePoint\n\nUntil now, Clipchamp has existed slightly outside the traditional Microsoft 365 flow—but that’s changing.\n\n## What’s New: A Unified Start Page for Clipchamp\n\nMicrosoft has introduced a **unified Clipchamp start page** that lives directly within the Microsoft 365 interface—just like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.\n\nThis update brings Clipchamp into the heart of your daily productivity tools and makes video creation as accessible as opening a document.\n\n### ✨ Key Features:\n\n- **Familiar M365 Interface:** The Clipchamp home page mirrors the look and feel of other Microsoft 365 apps, making it easy for users to navigate.\n- **All-in-One Hub:** Access recent projects, starred files, and shared videos in one view.\n- **Launch from Anywhere:** Open Clipchamp directly from Office.com, the Microsoft 365 app launcher, or pinned apps in your sidebar.\n- **Cloud Integration:** Projects can be saved and shared via OneDrive and SharePoint, ensuring your videos are secure and easily accessible from any device.\n- **Collaborative Editing:** Share video projects with colleagues for feedback and iteration—no downloading required.\n- **Template Jumpstart:** Quickly start a project using curated templates for business, education, training, or marketing use cases.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nVideo is no longer just a marketing or creative team task—it’s becoming a **core communication tool** across departments. From internal messaging and product explainers to virtual events and training, teams everywhere are embracing video.\n\nBy embedding Clipchamp in Microsoft 365, Microsoft is making video creation:\n\n- **Easier** — You don’t need to learn complex software or jump between platforms\n- **Faster** — Start creating instantly from your M365 dashboard\n- **Smarter** — Use built-in templates, AI tools, and cloud storage to streamline your workflow\n- **Collaborative** — Share and co-create with your team like you do with Word and PowerPoint files\n\n## Who Gets Access?\n\nThe unified Clipchamp start page is rolling out to **Microsoft 365 commercial and education users**, provided Clipchamp is enabled by your IT admin. If you’re already using Microsoft 365, you may see Clipchamp appear in your app launcher or at Office.com.\n\nAdministrators can manage access and licensing just like any other M365 app, and users can start projects directly from the cloud without needing any local installation.\n\nThe modern workplace demands new tools—and Microsoft is responding by bringing creative power into its productivity suite. With Clipchamp’s unified start page in Microsoft 365, video content is no longer an extra step—it’s built into your everyday workflow.\n\nSo go ahead—**record that pitch, explain that process, introduce that new idea—on camera.** Clipchamp is now right where you need it.\n\n**Lights, camera, productivity.**\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/introducing-the-unified-clipchamp-start-page-in-microsoft-365/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/introducing-the-unified-clipchamp-start-page-in-microsoft-365/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/introducing-the-unified-clipchamp-start-page-in-microsoft-365/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/introducing-the-unified-clipchamp-start-page-in-microsoft-365/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/introducing-the-unified-clipchamp-start-page-in-microsoft-365/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2125)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![GPT‑5 Finally Arrives in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copiltoGPT.webp?fit=655%2C667&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/gpt%e2%80%915-finally-arrives-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n[![What Is Microsoft Copilot Studio?
