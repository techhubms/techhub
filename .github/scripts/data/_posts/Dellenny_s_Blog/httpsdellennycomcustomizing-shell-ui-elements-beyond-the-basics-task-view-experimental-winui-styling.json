But if you’re willing to dig a little deeper into the **built-in Settings app and system menus**, you can shape how the **shell UI** looks and feels beyond just the surface.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk through what you can do today with Windows 11’s built-in features to tweak **Task View** and explore the **WinUI-based styling** already integrated into the OS.\n\n## 1. Task View Customization\n\nTask View (accessible with **Win + Tab**) is your hub for multitasking and managing virtual desktops. While Microsoft doesn’t expose every possible tweak, there are still ways to refine its look and feel.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Transparency & Background Effects**\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors**.\n- Toggle on **Transparency Effects**.\n- This changes Task View’s background into a blurred, acrylic-like layer, giving it a cleaner and more modern aesthetic.\n2. **Accent Colors in Task View**\n- Still under **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors**:\n- Enable **Show accent color on Start and taskbar**.\n- Pick a bold custom color or let Windows **Automatically pick an accent color from your background**.\n- Your chosen accent carries into Task View highlights, buttons, and virtual desktop indicators.\n3. **Virtual Desktop Names & Wallpapers**\n- Open **Task View (Win + Tab)**.\n- Right-click a desktop and choose **Rename**.\n- You can also set a unique wallpaper for each desktop by right-clicking the desktop thumbnail &gt; **Choose background**.\n- This makes Task View more personal and visually distinct.\n\n## 2. WinUI Styling That’s Already Built In\n\nWinUI is Microsoft’s design system for modern Windows apps—and parts of it are baked right into Windows 11’s shell. You don’t need external tools to see or tweak them; you just need to enable and adjust what’s already available.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Mica Material & Transparency**\n- Enable **Transparency Effects** (same as above).\n- This doesn’t just affect Task View—it also powers WinUI surfaces like the Start menu, Quick Settings, and File Explorer command bar.\n2. **Rounded Corners Everywhere**\n- Rounded corners in app windows and menus are a default WinUI styling choice. To see them consistently:\n- Use built-in apps like Settings, File Explorer, and Photos (they’re all styled with WinUI).\n- Apply **Light or Dark mode** via **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors** for best contrast with the rounded edges.\n3. **Dark Mode for Cohesive WinUI Look**\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors**.\n- Under **Choose your mode**, pick **Dark**.\n- WinUI’s dark styling is deeply integrated across system menus, Task View, and modern app shells.\n\n## 3. Advanced Shell Personalization with Built-In Options\n\nBeyond the flashy styling, Windows includes subtle personalization controls that influence how shell UI looks and feels.\n\n- **Taskbar Behavior**\n- **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Taskbar** lets you choose alignment (center or left) and which system icons appear.\n- **Start Menu Layout**\n- Adjust pinned apps or switch to **More Pins** or **More Recommendations** under **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Start**.\n- **Themes**\n- In **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes**, you can save and switch between full theme packages (wallpapers, sounds, colors, and cursor styles).\n\nThese changes carry into WinUI surfaces automatically, keeping the shell cohesive.\n\nYou don’t need to dive into hidden flags or third-party apps to enjoy a more **personalized, modern shell UI**. By making smart use of **built-in Windows features**—from transparency effects and accent colors to virtual desktop wallpapers and WinUI dark mode—you can give your system a distinct look that feels polished and uniquely yours.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/customizing-shell-ui-elements-beyond-the-basics-task-view-experimental-winui-styling/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/customizing-shell-ui-elements-beyond-the-basics-task-view-experimental-winui-styling/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/customizing-shell-ui-elements-beyond-the-basics-task-view-experimental-winui-styling/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/customizing-shell-ui-elements-beyond-the-basics-task-view-experimental-winui-styling/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/customizing-shell-ui-elements-beyond-the-basics-task-view-experimental-winui-styling/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2556)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Windows 11: What’s New Compared to Windows 10](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11new.webp?fit=725%2C697&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-whats-new-compared-to-windows-10/)\n\n[![Intel HAXM vs. Hyper-V/WHPX Choosing the Right Setup for Android Emulator on Windows](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/intelhyperv.webp?fit=724%2C718&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/)\n\n[![How to Use Hyper-V with BitLocker Without Constant Recovery Prompts](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bitlockerhyperv.webp?fit=774%2C765&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-hyper-v-with-bitlocker-without-constant-recovery-prompts/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
