Whether you prefer clicking through a visual interface, typing commands into a terminal, or automating scripts, Azure has a tool that fits your style. The three most common ways to interact with Azure are:\n\n- **Azure Portal**\n- **Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)**\n- **Azure PowerShell**\n\nEach of these tools is powerful in its own right, but choosing the right one depends on how you work, your role, and the tasks you need to accomplish. In this guide, we’ll explore what each tool offers, its pros and cons, and how to decide which option makes the most sense for your scenario.\n\n## **What Is the Azure Portal?**\n\nThe **Azure Portal** is Microsoft’s web-based interface for building, configuring, and managing cloud services. If you’ve ever logged into `portal.azure.com` , you’ve used it.\n\n### **Best for:**\n\n- Beginners and those new to cloud computing\n- Users who prefer visual tools\n- Making quick configuration changes\n- Viewing dashboards, monitoring charts, logs, and resource health\n\n### **Why People Love the Azure Portal**\n\nThe portal is intuitive and user-friendly. It allows you to perform tasks with just a few clicks — creating virtual machines, deploying databases, configuring role-based access control (RBAC), and more. Visual wizards and UI elements make it easier to understand what you’re creating and how resources connect.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n- No setup required — everything runs in your browser\n- Great for learning and demonstrations\n- Easy to explore resource relationships visually\n- Useful dashboards, monitoring, and cost management views\n\n### **Cons**\n\n- Not ideal for repetitive tasks\n- Slower than command-line automation\n- Harder to maintain consistency at scale\n- Can be prone to user errors if multiple users are clicking around\n\n## **What Is Azure CLI?**\n\nThe **Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)** is a cross-platform command tool used to create and manage Azure resources. If you’re someone who loves using the terminal, Azure CLI will feel right at home.\n\nAzure CLI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and you can even use it directly from the Azure Cloud Shell in the browser — no installation required.\n\n### **Best for:**\n\n- DevOps engineers\n- Developers who prefer scripting\n- Repetitive tasks and automation\n- Resource deployment in CI/CD pipelines\n\n### **Why Azure CLI Is Powerful**\n\nAzure CLI commands are simple, consistent, and designed to be readable. For example, creating a resource group might look like this:\n\n``` az group create --name MyResourceGroup --location eastus\n\n```\n\nBecause commands are scriptable, you can version them, check them into Git, and reuse them as often as you want. That’s a big win for automation and reliability.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n- Works on all major platforms\n- Easy to script and automate\n- Great for CI/CD workflows\n- Cloud Shell support means no installation required\n\n### **Cons**\n\n- Not ideal for users uncomfortable with the terminal\n- Less deeply integrated with Windows-native tools\n- Can become complex with longer deployments\n\n## **What Is Azure PowerShell?**\n\nIf you’re on Windows or you already work heavily with PowerShell, Azure PowerShell may be the perfect tool for you. It uses PowerShell cmdlets to manage Azure resources programmatically.\n\nPowerShell is deeply integrated into the Windows ecosystem, and many IT administrators already rely on it daily. With Azure PowerShell, they can extend that same workflow into the cloud.\n\n### **Best for:**\n\n- System administrators\n- Windows-centric environments\n- Users who already automate with PowerShell scripts\n- Advanced automation scenarios\n\n### **Why Azure PowerShell Shines**\n\nPowerShell is incredibly powerful for structured automation. For example, creating a resource group looks like this:\n\n``` New-AzResourceGroup -Name MyResourceGroup -Location EastUS\n\n```\n\nIf you’re already familiar with PowerShell’s pipelining and object-handling capabilities, Azure PowerShell feels natural.\n\n### **Pros**\n\n- Rich automation capabilities\n- Great for Windows-focused organizations\n- Deep scripting power with reusable cmdlets\n- Works well with other Microsoft administration tools\n\n### **Cons**\n\n- Learning curve if you’re new to PowerShell\n- Less popular in Linux-heavy environments\n- Can be more verbose than CLI\n\n## **Azure Portal vs Azure CLI vs Azure PowerShell — Which Should You Choose?**\n\nChoosing the right tool depends on your workflow, team, and comfort level. Here’s a quick comparison to make the decision easier:\n\n### **Use Azure Portal if:**\n\n- You’re new to Azure\n- You want to visualize resources and dependencies\n- You need dashboards, cost analysis, or monitoring\n- You’re making quick or one-time changes\n\n### **Use Azure CLI if:**\n\n- You want cross-platform automation\n- You need to integrate deployments with pipelines\n- You prefer simple scripting\n- You want something straightforward and readable across systems\n\n### **Use Azure PowerShell if:**\n\n- You’re already a PowerShell user\n- Your environment is Windows-heavy\n- You manage systems and cloud together\n- You want deep automation capabilities\n\n## **Why Most Professionals Use All Three**\n\nInterestingly, choosing a single tool is not always necessary — many engineers use different tools for different situations.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A developer may test a resource in the Azure Portal, then automate deployment with Azure CLI.\n- A system admin may monitor resources in the portal but automate provisioning with PowerShell scripts.\n- A DevOps engineer may rely on CI/CD tools that execute CLI commands while using the portal to check logs or health metrics.\n\nAzure gives you the freedom to switch between tools as needed, and that flexibility is one of the platform’s greatest strengths.\n\nAzure offers three powerful management approaches, and the “best” one depends on your use case:\n\n- **Azure Portal** is perfect for beginners and visual thinkers.\n- **Azure CLI** is ideal for developers and automation-focused teams who want something simple and cross-platform.\n- **Azure PowerShell** is great for admins and teams who already rely on PowerShell for automation.\n\nInstead of choosing only one, consider mastering the one that matches your role and gradually learning the others. The more tools you know, the more efficiently you can manage Azure at scale.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/exploring-azure-portal-cli-and-powershell-which-one-should-you-use/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/exploring-azure-portal-cli-and-powershell-which-one-should-you-use/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/exploring-azure-portal-cli-and-powershell-which-one-should-you-use/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/exploring-azure-portal-cli-and-powershell-which-one-should-you-use/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/exploring-azure-portal-cli-and-powershell-which-one-should-you-use/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3595)\n\nTags:[Azure](https://dellenny.com/tag/azure-2/ \"Azure\")\n\n[previousOptimizing Costs in Azure Practical Tips for Beginners](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-costs-in-azure-practical-tips-for-beginners/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3595)\n\n%d"
