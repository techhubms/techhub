  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content In today’s world of hybrid work, online learning, and endless video content, accessibility and clarity are more important than ever. Windows 11 introduces a game-changing feature designed to make spoken content more inclusive and easier to follow — **Live Captions**.\n\n#### **What Are Live Captions?**\n\nLive Captions automatically generate captions for any audio playing on your PC — whether it’s a YouTube video, a Zoom call, a podcast, or even an in-person conversation through your microphone. This means you can read along with what’s being said in real time, without needing built-in captions from the app or website itself.\n\n#### **Why Live Captions Matter**\n\nLive Captions aren’t just for those who are deaf or hard of hearing — they’re useful for everyone. Imagine you’re in a noisy café, on a call without headphones, or watching a video in a quiet library — captions can make sure you never miss a word.\n\nKey benefits include:\n\n- **Accessibility**: Helps users with hearing impairments fully participate in conversations and media.\n- **Clarity**: Makes speech easier to follow, especially when audio quality isn’t ideal.\n- **Privacy**: Unlike third-party transcription services, Live Captions run **entirely on your device**, ensuring your audio data stays private.\n\n#### **How to Turn On Live Captions in Windows 11**\n\nActivating Live Captions is simple:\n\n1. Press **Windows Key + Ctrl + L**\nor Go to **Settings → Accessibility → Captions → Live Captions**.\n2. Toggle the **Live Captions** switch to “On.”\n3. Once enabled, a caption box appears at the top of your screen. You can drag it anywhere or dock it to your preferred position.\n4. You can even **customize the caption style**, font size, and colors for readability.\n\n#### **Customizing the Experience**\n\nWindows 11 lets you tailor how captions appear:\n\n- Change **caption position** (top, bottom, or floating).\n- Adjust **text color**, **background color**, and **opacity**.\n- Choose your **language** (currently English is supported, with more languages coming soon).\n\n#### **Live Captions in Calls**\n\nDuring online meetings or calls, Live Captions can transcribe what participants say in real time — no matter what platform you’re using. Whether it’s Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or Discord, you’ll see every word appear on screen, making virtual communication smoother and more inclusive.\n\nWindows 11’s Live Captions feature isn’t just a small accessibility tweak — it’s a leap toward making digital communication truly inclusive. By bringing real-time, on-device captioning to all audio sources, Microsoft is ensuring that everyone can understand and participate, no matter the situation.\n\nIf you haven’t tried it yet, give Live Captions a go — you might be surprised how much clearer your digital world becomes.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/live-captions-in-windows-11-real-time-subtitles-for-videos-and-calls/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/live-captions-in-windows-11-real-time-subtitles-for-videos-and-calls/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/live-captions-in-windows-11-real-time-subtitles-for-videos-and-calls/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/live-captions-in-windows-11-real-time-subtitles-for-videos-and-calls/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/live-captions-in-windows-11-real-time-subtitles-for-videos-and-calls/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
