These malicious programs lock or encrypt your files and demand a ransom for restoring access. Thankfully, Windows 11 comes with built-in ransomware protection through **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**. However, this feature isn’t always turned on by default, so enabling it manually is a smart step to keep your data safe.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through how to enable ransomware protection on Windows 11.\n\n## Step 1: Open Windows Security\n\n1. Click on the **Start Menu** and type **Windows Security**.\n2. Select the **Windows Security** app from the search results.\n\n## Step 2: Navigate to Virus & Threat Protection\n\n1. In the Windows Security window, click on **Virus & threat protection** from the left-hand panel.\n2. Scroll down until you see the **Ransomware protection** section.\n\n## Step 3: Enable Controlled Folder Access\n\n1. Under **Ransomware protection**, click on **Manage ransomware protection**.\n2. Toggle **Controlled folder access** to **On**.\n\nThis feature blocks unauthorized apps from making changes to important files and folders.\n\n## Step 4: Configure Protected Folders (Optional but Recommended)\n\n- By default, Windows protects common folders like **Documents**, **Pictures**, **Videos**, and **Desktop**.\n- You can add more folders by clicking **Protected folders** and selecting **Add a protected folder**.\n- This ensures that your personal or work-related files in custom locations are also safe.\n\n## Step 5: Allow Trusted Apps (If Necessary)\n\nSometimes, legitimate apps may be blocked by ransomware protection.\n\n- To fix this, click **Allow an app through Controlled folder access**.\n- Add the trusted program you want to allow.\n\n## Extra Security Tip: Enable OneDrive File Recovery\n\nMicrosoft also integrates **OneDrive file recovery** with ransomware protection. If files are compromised, you can restore them from a previous backup in OneDrive—adding another layer of defense.\n\nRansomware can cause devastating data loss, but Windows 11 gives you powerful tools to prevent it. By enabling **Ransomware Protection** and **Controlled Folder Access**, you ensure that only trusted applications can modify your files. Take a few minutes today to set it up and give yourself peace of mind.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-ransomware-protection-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-ransomware-protection-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-ransomware-protection-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-ransomware-protection-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-ransomware-protection-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2428)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Improving Security on Your Windows 11 PC](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11security.webp?fit=687%2C692&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/improving-security-on-your-windows-11-pc/)\n\n[![How to Optimize Battery Life on Windows 11 Laptops](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11Battery.webp?fit=686%2C687&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/)\n\n[![How to Boost Performance with Built-In Tools in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11performance.webp?fit=687%2C673&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
