Whether you‚Äôre managing employees, partners, or customers, juggling multiple identity systems can lead to inefficiencies, security risks, and a poor user experience.\n\nThat‚Äôs where the **Federated Identity pattern** comes into play‚Äîespecially powerful when implemented in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using standards like **OAuth** and **SAML**.\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôll break down the concept of federated identity in AWS, how it works with external identity providers, and why it matters in a modern enterprise architecture.\n\n## üîê What Is Federated Identity?\n\n**Federated Identity** allows users to access AWS resources using credentials from an **external identity provider (IdP)**‚Äîsuch as **Google**, **Okta**, **Azure AD**, or even **your own SAML/OAuth-based IdP**.\n\nThis means users don‚Äôt need to have AWS-specific credentials. Instead, they authenticate with their existing credentials, and AWS trusts the IdP to assert the user‚Äôs identity.\n\n## üß≠ How Federated Identity Works in AWS\n\nFederated identity in AWS typically relies on two main components:\n\n- **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**\n- **AWS Security Token Service (STS)**\n\nHere‚Äôs a high-level workflow:\n\n1. **User logs in to an external identity provider** (via SAML or OAuth).\n2. **The IdP issues a token/assertion** that proves the user‚Äôs identity.\n3. **The token is sent to AWS STS**, which validates it and issues **temporary AWS credentials** (access key, secret key, session token).\n4. **The user accesses AWS resources** using these temporary credentials.\n\n## üåê Supported Identity Providers and Protocols\n\nAWS supports the following identity federation protocols:\n\n| Protocol | Common Use Cases | | --- | --- | | **SAML 2.0** | Enterprise SSO (e.g., Okta, AD FS, Azure AD) | | **OIDC (OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect)** | Web/mobile apps, social IdPs (e.g., Google, Facebook) | | **Custom identity brokers** | When advanced token validation and mapping are required |\n\nYou can integrate external IdPs via:\n\n- **IAM Identity Providers**\n- **Amazon Cognito**\n- **AWS IAM Identity Center** (formerly AWS SSO)\n\n## ‚úÖ Real-World Scenarios\n\n### 1. **Enterprise SSO with SAML**\n\nYour employees log in to AWS Management Console using their **Azure AD or Okta** credentials. You configure a SAML IdP in IAM, define roles with trust policies, and map SAML attributes to AWS IAM roles.\n\n### 2. **Web App Sign-In with OAuth/OIDC**\n\nYou‚Äôre building a customer-facing app. Users sign in using **Google or Facebook** via **Amazon Cognito**, which handles the OAuth 2.0/OIDC flow and issues AWS credentials through a user pool + identity pool.\n\n### 3. **Temporary Access to AWS APIs**\n\nYou use an internal identity broker that validates users against LDAP or another system and then calls **STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity** or **AssumeRoleWithSAML** to grant access.\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Example: SAML Federation with Azure AD\n\nTo enable SAML-based federation between Azure AD and AWS:\n\n1. **Register AWS as an enterprise application** in Azure AD.\n2. **Download the SAML metadata** from Azure AD and configure it as a SAML provider in AWS IAM.\n3. **Create IAM roles** with trust policies that allow access from the SAML provider.\n4. **Map users/groups in Azure AD** to IAM roles via SAML assertions.\n\nWhen users access AWS through Azure AD, they‚Äôre automatically signed in with appropriate role-based permissions.\n\n## üîß Example: OAuth/OIDC Federation with Google via Cognito\n\nWith **Amazon Cognito**, you can allow end users to log in using Google:\n\n1. **Create a Cognito user pool** and enable Google as an identity provider using OAuth 2.0 credentials.\n2. **Set up an identity pool** to allow authenticated users to access AWS services.\n3. **Map user roles in Cognito** based on their authentication status (authenticated vs. unauthenticated).\n\nThis is a great pattern for **mobile and web apps** that require secure, federated logins.\n\n## üí° Benefits of Federated Identity in AWS\n\n### üîê Stronger Security\n\n- No long-term AWS credentials are issued.\n- Temporary credentials reduce the risk of credential leakage.\n- Integrates seamlessly with MFA and conditional access via IdPs.\n\n### üöÄ Simplified User Access\n\n- Users authenticate with systems they already know.\n- Reduces password fatigue and improves productivity.\n\n### üß© Seamless Integration\n\n- Works with existing IdPs like Azure AD, Okta, Google, and custom brokers.\n- Easily extendable for both workforce and customer identity scenarios.\n\n### ‚öôÔ∏è Fine-Grained Access Control\n\n- Use SAML/OIDC attributes to control access to specific AWS roles and resources.\n\n## üß≠ Best Practices\n\n- **Use short-lived credentials** with STS to minimize attack surface.\n- **Enable MFA** through the IdP for added security.\n- **Audit access** via CloudTrail and AWS IAM Access Analyzer.\n- **Apply least privilege** when mapping roles and policies.\n- **Use AWS IAM Identity Center** for simplified, centralized management of enterprise access.\n\nThe **Federated Identity pattern** is a foundational component for building secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication experiences in AWS. Whether you‚Äôre providing **enterprise access via SAML**, or enabling **customer sign-ins via OAuth**, AWS offers flexible tools like **IAM**, **STS**, and **Cognito** to make integration seamless.\n\nBy embracing federated identity, you reduce friction for users, centralize access control, and strengthen your security posture‚Äîall critical for success in the cloud.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/federated-identity-in-aws-streamlining-access-with-external-identity-providers/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/federated-identity-in-aws-streamlining-access-with-external-identity-providers/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/federated-identity-in-aws-streamlining-access-with-external-identity-providers/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/federated-identity-in-aws-streamlining-access-with-external-identity-providers/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/federated-identity-in-aws-streamlining-access-with-external-identity-providers/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2135)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Building Resilient Systems with Immutable Infrastructure on AWS](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/awspatterns.webp?fit=676%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/)\n\n[![Building Resilient Systems with Immutable Infrastructure on Azure](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/azurecloud.webp?fit=716%2C674&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/)\n\n[![Secret Store Pattern in AWS Using Secure Vaults for Credentials and Secrets](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/awspatterns.webp?fit=676%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d"
