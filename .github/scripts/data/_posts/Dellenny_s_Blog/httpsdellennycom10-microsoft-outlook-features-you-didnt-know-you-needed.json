But buried inside are tools that can save you time, keep you organized, and make your workday smoother. Here are 10 features you probably didn’t know you needed — and exactly how to use them.\n\n## 1. Delay or Schedule Email Delivery\n\nEver wanted to write an email now but send it later? Outlook lets you schedule messages.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Compose your email as usual.\n2. In the message window, click **Options** → **Delay Delivery**.\n3. Under *Delivery options*, check **Do not deliver before** and choose a date and time.\n4. Click **Close**, then send the email — it will stay in your Outbox until the scheduled time.\n\n## 2. Use Email Templates for Repeated Messages\n\nIf you send similar emails often, save them as templates to reuse.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Write the email.\n2. Go to **File** → **Save As**.\n3. Choose **Outlook Template (\\*.oft)** and save.\n4. To use it later: **Home** → **New Items** → **More Items** → **Choose Form** → pick your template.\n\n## 3. Color-Code Emails Automatically with Conditional Formatting\n\nMake important emails stand out without manually tagging them.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Go to **View** → **View Settings** → **Conditional Formatting**.\n2. Click **Add**, name your rule, and choose a color.\n3. Click **Condition**, set your criteria (e.g., emails from your manager), then save.\n\n## 4. Ignore Entire Email Conversations\n\nTired of reply-all chains? You can mute them.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Select the email in the conversation.\n2. Go to **Home** → **Ignore**.\n3. All future replies will skip your inbox and head to Deleted Items.\n\n## 5. Use Quick Steps for One-Click Actions\n\nQuick Steps let you combine multiple actions (e.g., move email + mark as read + forward) into a single click.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Go to **Home** → **Quick Steps** → **Create New**.\n2. Name it, add actions, and assign a shortcut key if you like.\n3. Select an email and run your Quick Step to save time.\n\n## 6. Search Folders for Instant Organization\n\nSearch Folders are like virtual folders that show all emails matching certain rules without moving them.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Go to **Folder** → **New Search Folder**.\n2. Choose from built-in options (e.g., “Mail from specific people”) or create a custom search.\n3. Access it from the navigation pane like a normal folder.\n\n## 7. Drag and Drop Emails to Create Calendar Events\n\nTurn any email into a meeting request instantly.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Click and hold the email.\n2. Drag it to the **Calendar** icon in the navigation bar.\n3. Outlook will create a new event with the email’s content in the body.\n\n## 8. Turn On Focused Inbox for a Cleaner View\n\nFocused Inbox separates important emails from less critical ones.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Go to **View** → **Show Focused Inbox**.\n2. Outlook will create two tabs: *Focused* and *Other*.\n3. Move emails between tabs to train it.\n\n## 9. Convert Emails to Tasks\n\nStop using your inbox as a to-do list — make real tasks instead.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Drag an email to the **Tasks** icon in the navigation bar.\n2. Set a due date, priority, and reminders.\n3. Save it — now it’s in your task list.\n\n## 10. Use Voting Buttons for Quick Polls\n\nNeed a team decision fast? Let people vote directly from your email.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Create a new email.\n2. Go to **Options** → **Use Voting Buttons**.\n3. Choose preset options or create your own (separated by semicolons).\n4. Recipients can click their choice, and Outlook will track responses.\n\nOutlook isn’t just a mailbox — it’s a full productivity toolkit. Try one or two of these features this week, and you might never go back to your old email habits.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-outlook-features-you-didnt-know-you-needed/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-outlook-features-you-didnt-know-you-needed/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-outlook-features-you-didnt-know-you-needed/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-outlook-features-you-didnt-know-you-needed/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-outlook-features-you-didnt-know-you-needed/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2254)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Transform Your Email Game with Outlook Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/outllooCopilot.webp?fit=712%2C719&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/transform-your-email-game-with-outlook-copilot/)\n\n[![Monitor the Health of Your Microsoft 365 Services What You Need to Know](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/M365Migration.png?fit=826%2C806&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/monitor-the-health-of-your-microsoft-365-services-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n[![Introducing the Unified Clipchamp Start Page in Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/videoediting.png?fit=711%2C708&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/introducing-the-unified-clipchamp-start-page-in-microsoft-365/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
