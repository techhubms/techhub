Whether itâ€™s a laggy start menu, Wi-Fi drops, or stubborn updates, you donâ€™t always need to call IT to get back on track. Hereâ€™s how to fix common Windows 11 issues yourself, safely and efficiently.\n\n## 1. Restart Before You Panic\n\nIt sounds simple, but rebooting often fixes temporary system glitches, clears memory, and resets background processes. **Try this first:**\n\n- Click **Start â†’ Power â†’ Restart**.\n- Wait for your PC to fully reboot before testing again.\n\nðŸ’¡ *Pro tip:* If your system is frozen, hold the power button for 10 seconds to force a shutdown, then turn it back on.\n\n## 2. Fix Wi-Fi and Internet Issues\n\nIf your Wi-Fi keeps dropping or wonâ€™t connect, try these quick steps:\n\n1. **Run the built-in troubleshooter:**\n- Go to **Settings â†’ System â†’ Troubleshoot â†’ Other troubleshooters**.\n- Click **Run** next to *Internet Connections*.\n2. **Reset your network adapter:**\n- Open **Settings â†’ Network & Internet â†’ Advanced network settings â†’ Network reset**.\n- Restart your PC after the reset.\n\nIf that doesnâ€™t help, unplug your router for 30 seconds and plug it back in.\n\n## 3. Speed Up a Slow PC\n\nA sluggish computer often needs a little cleanup. Try this:\n\n- **Close startup programs:**\n- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.\n- Go to **Startup apps** and disable anything you donâ€™t need.\n- **Free up space:**\n- Go to **Settings â†’ System â†’ Storage â†’ Cleanup recommendations**.\n- **Run Windows Update:**\n- Sometimes new updates contain performance fixes.\n\n## 4. Fix Frozen Apps or Programs\n\nIf an app refuses to close or respond:\n\n1. Press **Ctrl + Alt + Delete** and open **Task Manager**.\n2. Find the frozen app, select it, and click **End task**.\n3. Restart the app.\n\nStill crashing? Try reinstalling the app or checking for updates in the **Microsoft Store**.\n\n## 5. Solve Update Problems\n\nIf Windows updates fail or get stuck:\n\n1. Run the **Windows Update Troubleshooter:**\n- Go to **Settings â†’ System â†’ Troubleshoot â†’ Other troubleshooters â†’ Windows Update â†’ Run**.\n2. Clear the update cache manually (advanced users):\n- Open Command Prompt as administrator and type: `net stop wuauserv net stop bits del %systemroot%\\SoftwareDistribution\\DataStore\\*.* /s /q net start wuauserv net start bits`\n3. Restart your computer and check for updates again.\n\n## 6. Fix Sound Problems\n\nIf your speakers or headphones suddenly stop working:\n\n1. Right-click the **sound icon** â†’ **Troubleshoot sound problems**.\n2. Make sure the right output device is selected.\n3. Update your sound driver:\n- Right-click **Start â†’ Device Manager â†’ Sound, video, and game controllers** â†’ right-click your audio device â†’ **Update driver**.\n\n## 7. When All Else Fails â€” Use System Restore\n\nIf nothing works, roll your PC back to a time when it did:\n\n- Type **System Restore** in the Start menu search.\n- Select **Create a restore point â†’ System Restore â†’ Choose a restore point**.\n- Follow the prompts to restore.\n\nThis wonâ€™t affect your personal filesâ€”it just resets system settings and drivers.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-windows-11-problems-without-calling-it/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-windows-11-problems-without-calling-it/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-windows-11-problems-without-calling-it/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-windows-11-problems-without-calling-it/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-windows-11-problems-without-calling-it/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2872)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![24 Hidden Windows 11 Features Youâ€™ll Wish You Found Sooner](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/win11-s4hidden.webp?fit=767%2C769&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/24-hidden-windows-11-features-youll-wish-you-found-sooner/)\n\n[![From Start Menu to Widgets Customizing Windows 11 Like a Pro](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/win11-ustomizing-Windows-11-Like-a-Pro.webp?fit=835%2C774&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/from-start-menu-to-widgets-customizing-windows-11-like-a-pro/)\n\n[![The New Age of PC Copilots Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/pccopilot.webp?fit=772%2C763&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/the-new-age-of-pc-copilots-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2872)\n\n%d",
