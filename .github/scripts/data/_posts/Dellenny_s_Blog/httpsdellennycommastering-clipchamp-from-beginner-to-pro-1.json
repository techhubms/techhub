It’s Microsoft’s free, browser-based video editor designed for beginners and creators who want professional-looking videos without a steep learning curve.\n\nThis blog will walk you through the **basics of getting started** — from logging in to creating your very first project. Let’s dive in!\n\n## ✨ Why Choose Clipchamp?\n\nClipchamp is perfect if you:\n\n- Create content for **YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, or business presentations**\n- Want a tool that runs in your browser with **no downloads** required\n- Prefer a **drag-and-drop editor** that’s simple but powerful\n\nThink of it as your personal video studio in the cloud.\n\n## 🔑 Step 1: Sign Up & Log In\n\nTo begin, go to clipchamp.com.\n\n- Click **Sign up for free**\n- Choose to log in with:\n- Your **Microsoft account** (best option for Windows users)\n- Google\n- Or create a standalone Clipchamp account\n\nOnce you’re logged in, you’ll land on the **dashboard**, your creative hub.\n\n👉 **Pro Tip:** If you’re on Windows 11, Clipchamp is already built in — just search “Clipchamp” in your Start menu.\n\n## 🎬 Step 2: Create a New Project\n\nNow it’s time to start editing.\n\n1. Click the big purple **Create a video** button\n2. Choose your **aspect ratio**(this determines your video’s shape):\n- **16:9 (landscape)** → perfect for YouTube or presentations\n- **9:16 (vertical)** → ideal for TikTok, Instagram Reels, or Shorts\n- **1:1 (square)** → Instagram feed posts\n- **21:9 (cinematic)** → widescreen for dramatic videos\n\n👉 **Pro Tip:** If you’re not sure which to choose, go with **16:9** — it’s the most versatile format.\n\n## 🖥️ Step 3: Explore the Dashboard\n\nBefore jumping into editing, let’s get familiar with the workspace:\n\n- **Media Library** (left side): where you upload your video clips, images, and audio\n- **Timeline** (bottom): the heart of editing — drag and arrange clips here\n- **Toolbar** (top left): access text, transitions, filters, and stock media\n- **Preview Window** (center): play your video and see changes in real time\n\n👉 **Pro Tip:** Clipchamp autosaves your project as you work, but it’s still smart to give your project a clear name (e.g., *“Travel\\_Vlog\\_Intro”*).\n\nCongratulations! 🎉 You’ve taken your first steps into Clipchamp. You now know how to:\n\n- Sign up and log in\n- Start a new project with the right aspect ratio\n- Navigate the dashboard confidently\n\nIn the next blog, we’ll move on to **basic editing — trimming, cutting, and arranging clips to shape your story.**\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/mastering-clipchamp-from-beginner-to-pro-1/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/mastering-clipchamp-from-beginner-to-pro-1/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/mastering-clipchamp-from-beginner-to-pro-1/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/mastering-clipchamp-from-beginner-to-pro-1/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/mastering-clipchamp-from-beginner-to-pro-1/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2382)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Use Focus Sessions in Windows 11 to Stay Productive](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-2.png?fit=578%2C527&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-focus-sessions-in-windows-11-to-stay-productive/)\n\n[![How to Set Up Hyper-V Virtual Machines in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hyperv.webp?fit=745%2C741&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Syncing Your Android Phone with Windows 11 Using Phone Link](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11andorid.webp?fit=767%2C751&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/syncing-your-android-phone-with-windows-11-using-phone-link/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
