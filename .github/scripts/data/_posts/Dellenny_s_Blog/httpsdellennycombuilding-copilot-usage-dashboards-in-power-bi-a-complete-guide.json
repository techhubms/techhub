Microsoft Copilot—now integrated across Microsoft 365—promises improvements in productivity, decision-making, and collaboration. But like any tool, leaders need visibility into its usage: *Who’s using Copilot? How often? Which features? Is productivity actually improving?*\n\nThat’s where **Power BI** comes in. With its ability to connect to Microsoft 365 usage data and transform raw logs into actionable insights, Power BI is the perfect platform for building **Copilot usage dashboards**. Whether you’re an IT administrator, analyst, or a business stakeholder, creating these dashboards helps you track adoption, spot trends, and measure ROI.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk through everything you need to know—from data sources and modeling tips to the visuals that deliver the most value.\n\n## **Why Build a Copilot Usage Dashboard?**\n\nCopilot usage dashboards offer several benefits:\n\n### **1. Understand adoption**\n\nYou can see how many users are actively leveraging Copilot, which departments are using it the most, and whether adoption is growing over time.\n\n### **2. Measure productivity impact**\n\nUsage data helps you understand trends such as document generation, summarization, meeting note enhancements, and other intelligent actions Copilot provides.\n\n### **3. Optimize license investments**\n\nCopilot licenses are not cheap. Dashboards help highlight underutilized seats so organizations can make better licensing decisions.\n\n### **4. Enhance user experience**\n\nUnderstanding how people use Copilot helps shape training programs and identify opportunities to increase value.\n\n## **Step 1: Identifying Your Copilot Data Sources**\n\nBefore building your dashboard, you need reliable data. Microsoft offers several sources of Copilot usage data:\n\n### **Microsoft Graph Reports API**\n\nThis is the primary source for Copilot usage metrics. It includes data such as:\n\n- User-level Copilot activity\n- Frequency of Copilot usage\n- Applications where Copilot was used (Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook, etc.)\n- Interaction types (summaries, draft generation, Q&A, etc.)\n\nYou can extract this API data and store it in:\n\n- Azure SQL\n- Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse\n- SharePoint Lists\n- Dataverse\n- CSV/Excel files\n\n### **Microsoft 365 Usage Reports (Admin Center)**\n\nThese offer high-level insights but are less customizable. However, you can export usage data or connect directly using Power BI’s built-in connectors.\n\n### **Audit Logs (Purview Compliance Portal)**\n\nIf you need granular details, audit logs contain rich information on Copilot interactions. You may need to create scripts to clean and standardize the logs before using them in Power BI.\n\n## **Step 2: Loading Copilot Usage Data into Power BI**\n\nThere are two main ways to bring Copilot data into Power BI:\n\n### **1. Direct API Connection**\n\nUsing Power Query, you can call Microsoft Graph directly using:\n\n- OAuth authentication\n- A custom connector\n- A service principal\n\nOnce connected, you can schedule refreshes through the Power BI Service.\n\n### **2. Import from Storage**\n\nIf your organization pipelines data into:\n\n- Azure Data Lake\n- SQL Database\n- Fabric Lakehouse\n\n…then you can connect through native Power BI connectors and automate refreshes easily.\n\nWhichever method you choose, ensure your data ingestion process captures:\n\n- Timestamps\n- User information (with privacy compliance)\n- Action types\n- Application context\n\n## **Step 3: Data Modeling for Copilot Analytics**\n\nGood dashboards start with clean data models. In Power BI, aim for a **star schema**:\n\n### **Fact table: Copilot activity**\n\nIncludes columns like:\n\n- `UserID`\n- `ActivityDate`\n- `ActivityType`\n- `Application`\n- `CountOfActions`\n- `Duration`\n(if available)\n\n### **Dimension tables:**\n\n- **Users** (department, region, role)\n- **Applications** (Word, Excel, Outlook, Teams)\n- **Activity types** (drafting, summarization, meeting recap)\n- **Calendar** (date hierarchy)\n\nBe sure to:\n\n- Use surrogate keys\n- Create relationships with *single-direction filters*\n- Build a date table for trending analysis\n\nThis ensures visuals load fast and remain accurate.\n\n## **Step 4: Designing the Copilot Usage Dashboard in Power BI**\n\nOnce your data model is ready, you can design visuals. A strong Copilot dashboard typically includes:\n\n### **1. Adoption Overview**\n\nKey visuals:\n\n- Total active Copilot users\n- Daily/weekly/monthly active users (DAU/WAU/MAU)\n- Adoption trend line\n- License utilization rate\n\nWhy it matters: This section quickly tells leaders whether the investment is paying off.\n\n### **2. Usage by Application**\n\nBreak down Copilot usage across:\n\n- Word (drafts, summaries)\n- Excel (analysis, formula generation)\n- PowerPoint (slide creation)\n- Outlook (email drafting)\n- Teams (meeting recap, chat assistance)\n\nA stacked column chart or tree map works well here.\n\n### **3. Activity Type Insights**\n\nShow how people use Copilot:\n\n- Draft creation\n- Rewrite or summarize\n- Explain actions\n- Q&A interactions\n\nThis helps IT understand what users value most.\n\n### **4. Department or Role Insights**\n\nVisuals:\n\n- Heatmaps\n- Bar charts by department\n- Adoption by job title or business unit\n\nThis reveals where Copilot is most impactful—and where more training may be needed.\n\n### **5. Productivity Impact Indicators**\n\nWhile direct measurement is tricky, proxies help:\n\n- Time saved per action (based on Microsoft’s standard estimates)\n- Reduction in document creation time\n- Increase in meeting efficiency\n\nYou can use DAX measures to calculate estimated productivity impact.\n\n## **Step 5: Adding DAX Measures to Enrich Insights**\n\nUse DAX to create metrics such as:\n\n``` Active Users = CALCULATE( DISTINCTCOUNT('CopilotActivity'[UserID]), FILTER('CopilotActivity', 'CopilotActivity'[CountOfActions] > 0) )\n\n```\n\n``` Actions Per User = DIVIDE( SUM('CopilotActivity'[CountOfActions]), DISTINCTCOUNT('CopilotActivity'[UserID]) )\n\n```\n\n``` Copilot Usage Trend = CALCULATE( SUM('CopilotActivity'[CountOfActions]), DATESYTD('Date'[Date]) )\n\n```\n\nThese measures make your dashboard dynamic and shareable.\n\n## **Step 6: Publishing and Sharing the Dashboard**\n\nOnce finalized:\n\n1. Publish the report to Power BI Service\n2. Create a workspace for Copilot analytics\n3. Set scheduled refreshes\n4. Manage permissions (data often requires admin-level oversight)\n\nUse **Power BI Apps** to distribute dashboards cleanly across the organization.\n\n## **Best Practices for Copilot Dashboards**\n\n- **Ensure data privacy:** Mask identifiable user data unless permission is granted.\n- **Keep visuals simple:** Leaders need clarity, not clutter.\n- **Add tooltips and drill-through pages:** This gives depth without overwhelming the main dashboard.\n- **Refresh frequently:** Copilot data becomes stale quickly.\n- **Iterate with stakeholders:** Let teams request features that improve decision-making.\n\nBuilding Copilot usage dashboards in Power BI unlocks powerful insights that drive adoption, inform training strategies, and ensure your investment delivers real value. By combining quality data with strong modeling and compelling visuals, organizations can finally quantify how AI is changing the way employees work.\n\nWhether you’re rolling out Copilot across thousands of users or piloting it within a single department, a well-designed dashboard is your compass for navigating the AI-powered future.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/building-copilot-usage-dashboards-in-power-bi-a-complete-guide/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/building-copilot-usage-dashboards-in-power-bi-a-complete-guide/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/building-copilot-usage-dashboards-in-power-bi-a-complete-guide/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/building-copilot-usage-dashboards-in-power-bi-a-complete-guide/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/building-copilot-usage-dashboards-in-power-bi-a-complete-guide/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3501)\n\nTags:[Artificial Intelligence](https://dellenny.com/tag/artificial-intelligence-2/ \"Artificial Intelligence\")[M365 Copilot](https://dellenny.com/tag/m365-copilot/ \"M365 Copilot\")\n\n[previousThe 4+1 View Model of Architecture Explained: A Complete Guide](https://dellenny.com/the-41-view-model-of-architecture-explained-a-complete-guide/)\n\n[nextMonitoring Security and Compliance Metrics for Copilot: A Human-Centered Guide](https://dellenny.com/monitoring-security-and-compliance-metrics-for-copilot-a-complete-human-focused-guide/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3501)\n\n%d",
