Out of the box, the emulator can be painfully slow without hardware acceleration. That’s where **Intel HAXM** and **Hyper-V/WHPX** come in.\n\nIn this post, we’ll break down what these technologies are, how they interact with Android Studio, and when you should use one over the other.\n\n## Why Hardware Acceleration Matters for the Android Emulator\n\nThe Android Emulator simulates Android devices on your PC. Without acceleration, it relies only on software emulation, which is sluggish and almost unusable for serious development.\n\nHardware-assisted virtualization uses your CPU’s virtualization features (Intel VT-x, AMD-V) to boost performance. On Windows, this can be achieved using:\n\n- **Intel HAXM** (for Intel CPUs only)\n- **Hyper-V + Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHPX)**\n\n## Intel HAXM (Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager)\n\n**Intel HAXM** is Intel’s virtualization engine designed specifically for the Android Emulator.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Works **only with Intel CPUs**.\n- Requires **Intel VT-x** and **Execute Disable Bit (XD/NX)** to be enabled in BIOS.\n- **Cannot run alongside Hyper-V** (you must disable Hyper-V to use it).\n- Known for providing **fast emulator performance**.\n\n### How to Enable\n\n1. Enable virtualization in BIOS.\n2. Disable Hyper-V on Windows (`dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V`\n).\n3. In Android Studio → **SDK Manager** → install **Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer)**.\n4. Run the installer manually from the Android SDK folder.\n\n## Hyper-V & Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHPX)\n\n**Hyper-V** is Microsoft’s built-in hypervisor for running virtual machines. **Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHPX)** is an API layer that allows applications (like the Android Emulator) to use Hyper-V for acceleration.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- Works with both **Intel and AMD CPUs**.\n- Allows you to keep Hyper-V enabled for other workloads (e.g., Docker, WSL2, or VM testing).\n- No need to disable Hyper-V as with HAXM.\n- Performance is usually good, though in some setups it can be slightly slower than HAXM.\n\n### How to Enable\n\n1. In **Windows Features**, turn on:\n- **Hyper-V**\n- **Windows Hypervisor Platform**\n2. Restart your PC.\n3. In Android Studio, the emulator will automatically use WHPX for acceleration.\n\n## Choosing Between HAXM and Hyper-V/WHPX\n\n| Feature | Intel HAXM | Hyper-V/WHPX | | --- | --- | --- | | CPU Support | Intel only | Intel & AMD | | Hyper-V Dependency | Must be disabled | Must be enabled | | Performance | Often slightly faster | Good, but can vary | | Use Case | Best for dedicated Android dev environments | Best if you also use Docker, WSL2, or VMs |\n\n## Android Studio + Emulator Workflow\n\n- Install Android Studio.\n- Configure an **Android Virtual Device (AVD)**.\n- Choose the right acceleration option (HAXM or WHPX) based on your setup.\n- Run your emulator with hardware acceleration for smooth testing.\n\nIf you’re a Windows developer working with Android Studio, you’ll need to pick the right virtualization engine for your emulator:\n\n- Go with **Intel HAXM** if you have an Intel CPU and don’t rely on Hyper-V for anything else.\n- Stick with **Hyper-V/WHPX** if you use Docker, WSL2, or other VM workloads, or if you’re on an AMD CPU.\n\nEither way, enabling hardware acceleration will make the Android Emulator **far more usable** and speed up your development workflow.\n\n> [How to Use Hyper-V with BitLocker Without Constant Recovery Prompts](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-hyper-v-with-bitlocker-without-constant-recovery-prompts/)\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2528)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Use Hyper-V with BitLocker Without Constant Recovery Prompts](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bitlockerhyperv.webp?fit=774%2C765&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-hyper-v-with-bitlocker-without-constant-recovery-prompts/)\n\n[![Optimizing Windows 11 for Gaming Performance](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11gaming.webp?fit=770%2C771&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-windows-11-for-gaming-performance/)\n\n[![Xbox Game Pass Integration and Hidden Features](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xboxgamepass.webp?fit=741%2C739&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/xbox-game-pass-integration-and-hidden-features/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
