While the new design is clean and user-friendly, many users prefer customizing the taskbar to fit their workflow. Whether you want to move the taskbar to a different screen position or modify the appearance of your icons, Windows 11 gives you several ways to do it.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through how to **change the taskbar position**, **adjust icon alignment**, and **personalize your desktop experience**.\n\n### **1. Changing Taskbar Alignment (Center or Left)**\n\nBy default, Windows 11 centers your taskbar icons, but you can easily shift them to the left for a more classic Windows feel.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Right-click anywhere on the **taskbar**.\n2. Select **Taskbar settings**.\n3. Under **Taskbar behaviors**, look for **Taskbar alignment**.\n4. From the dropdown menu, choose **Left** or **Center**.\n5. Your icons will instantly shift to the new alignment.\n\nThis small tweak can make your desktop feel familiar if you’ve upgraded from Windows 10.\n\n### **2. Moving the Taskbar to the Top, Left, or Right**\n\nWindows 11 officially restricts the taskbar to the bottom of the screen. However, with registry tweaks, you can move it elsewhere.\n\n**⚠️ Important:** Registry changes should be done carefully — create a restore point before proceeding.\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Press **Win + R**, type `regedit`\n, and hit **Enter**.\n2. Navigate to:\n`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\StuckRects3`\n3. Double-click the **Settings** binary value.\n4. In the **Value data** panel, locate the **03**value in the second row and fifth column.\n- **00** = Top\n- **01** = Left\n- **02** = Right\n- **03** = Bottom (default)\n5. Change it to your desired position (e.g., **00** for Top).\n6. Click **OK**, close the Registry Editor, and restart **Windows Explorer** or reboot your PC.\n\nYour taskbar should now appear in the new position.\n\n### **3. Customizing Taskbar Icons**\n\nYou can personalize icons on your taskbar to make them more functional or visually appealing.\n\n#### **To Pin or Unpin Apps:**\n\n- **Pin:** Right-click an app in the Start Menu or desktop, then select **Pin to taskbar**.\n- **Unpin:** Right-click the icon on the taskbar and select **Unpin from taskbar**.\n\n#### **To Change Icon Size:**\n\n1. Open **Taskbar settings**.\n2. Under **Taskbar behaviors**, look for **Taskbar size**.\n3. Choose **Small**, **Medium**, or **Large** (if available).\n\n### **4. Additional Taskbar Customization Tips**\n\n- **Show or Hide System Icons:**\nIn **Taskbar settings**, go to **Other system tray icons** and toggle visibility for icons like Bluetooth, Network, or Volume.\n- **Auto-Hide Taskbar:**\nEnable **Automatically hide the taskbar** under **Taskbar behaviors** for a cleaner desktop.\n- **Transparency Effect:**\nTurn on **Transparency effects** in **Personalization > Colors** to make your taskbar blend smoothly with your wallpaper.\n\nCustomizing your Windows 11 taskbar is a simple way to make your workspace feel uniquely yours. Whether you prefer the classic left-aligned look, want the taskbar at the top of your screen, or enjoy a minimalist icon layout, Windows 11 offers the flexibility to suit your style.\n\nWith a few tweaks — and a touch of creativity — you can transform your taskbar from basic to brilliant.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-change-taskbar-position-and-icons-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-change-taskbar-position-and-icons-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-change-taskbar-position-and-icons-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-change-taskbar-position-and-icons-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-change-taskbar-position-and-icons-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
