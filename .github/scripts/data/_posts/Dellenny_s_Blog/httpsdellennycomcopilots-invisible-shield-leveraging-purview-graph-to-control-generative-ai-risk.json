Microsoft Copilot’s integration with **Microsoft Purview** and **Microsoft Graph** forms an *invisible shield* around your data — ensuring that every response respects your organization’s existing security and compliance boundaries.\n\nThis isn’t just about powerful features. It’s about **responsible access** — and making sure that AI never sees what users shouldn’t.\n\n## The Foundation: Microsoft Graph as the Intelligence Layer\n\nCopilot doesn’t scrape your organization’s data randomly. It works through **Microsoft Graph**, the secure data fabric that connects your Microsoft 365 environment — including Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, and more.\n\nGraph is permission-aware by design. This means:\n\n- Copilot can **only access** information that the user themselves can access in Microsoft 365.\n- If you don’t have permission to open a file, read an email, or view a SharePoint document, **Copilot can’t either**.\n- Graph continuously enforces identity, role, and context — ensuring Copilot’s insights are consistent with your access rights.\n\nIn short: Copilot inherits your permissions. It doesn’t override them.\n\n## Microsoft Purview: Governance that Extends to AI\n\nWhile Graph governs access, **Microsoft Purview** governs *what* Copilot can interact with.\n\nPurview provides **data classification**, **sensitivity labeling**, and **data loss prevention (DLP)** — controls that are automatically respected by Copilot.\n\nThis means:\n\n- Sensitive files labeled as *Confidential* or *Highly Confidential* are governed by the same policies, even when Copilot is generating responses.\n- If your organization has rules preventing external sharing or AI exposure of specific data types (like financials or PII), those same rules apply in every Copilot query.\n- Administrators can define compliance boundaries that restrict how Copilot retrieves or surfaces data, minimizing the risk of unintentional data leakage.\n\nPurview ensures governance isn’t left behind when AI steps in.\n\n## Data Leakage Prevention by Design\n\nThe most effective data protection strategy is one users never have to think about. Copilot’s integration with Purview and Graph creates a **zero-trust AI layer** that prevents overexposure at the source.\n\nHere’s how this manifests in practice:\n\n- **No Shadow Access:** Copilot doesn’t gain super-user privileges or index restricted data.\n- **Real-Time Enforcement:** Every Copilot query runs through Graph’s permission model at the moment of request — no cached or pre-expanded access.\n- **Policy-Aware Responses:** Purview’s DLP and sensitivity labels inform what Copilot can surface or summarize.\n\nIn essence, Copilot doesn’t just generate text — it generates *trustworthy* text.\n\n## Beyond Features\n\nGenerative AI isn’t just another productivity tool — it’s a new interface to your organization’s data. That’s why Microsoft has built Copilot with **security, compliance, and privacy at the core**, not as an afterthought.\n\nBy combining **Microsoft Graph’s granular permissions** with **Purview’s unified governance**, Copilot ensures that innovation and information protection move in lockstep.\n\nThe result? An intelligent assistant that works *within* your compliance perimeter — not around it.\n\n## Responsible AI Starts with Responsible Data\n\nEvery Copilot response is powered by your organization’s data. Ensuring that data stays protected is non-negotiable.\n\nMicrosoft’s approach — blending Graph’s access model with Purview’s governance framework — gives IT leaders confidence that Copilot will empower employees **without compromising compliance**.\n\nIt’s not just AI that’s smart — it’s the shield around it.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/copilots-invisible-shield-leveraging-purview-graph-to-control-generative-ai-risk/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/copilots-invisible-shield-leveraging-purview-graph-to-control-generative-ai-risk/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/copilots-invisible-shield-leveraging-purview-graph-to-control-generative-ai-risk/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/copilots-invisible-shield-leveraging-purview-graph-to-control-generative-ai-risk/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/copilots-invisible-shield-leveraging-purview-graph-to-control-generative-ai-risk/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Beyond Compliance Using Copilot to Automate GDPR and HIPAA Reporting from Teams and Outlook](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20770%20777%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://dellenny.com/beyond-compliance-using-copilot-to-automate-gdpr-and-hipaa-reporting-from-teams-and-outlook/)\n\n[![Prompt Injection Protection How Microsoft 365 Copilot Defends Against Jailbreak Attacks](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20772%20654%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://dellenny.com/prompt-injection-protection-how-microsoft-365-copilot-defends-against-jailbreak-attacks/)\n\n[![When Words Matter Noise-Free, Domain-Specific Voice Recognition with Azure Custom Speech](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20777%20743%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)](https://dellenny.com/when-words-matter-noise-free-domain-specific-voice-recognition-with-azure-custom-speech/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
