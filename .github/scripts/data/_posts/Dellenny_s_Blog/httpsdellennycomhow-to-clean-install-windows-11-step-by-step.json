Below is a complete, practical, up-to-date walkthrough that covers preparation, creating boot media, BIOS/UEFI settings, the actual clean install, and post-install tips.\n\n## Before You Start — Checklist\n\n1. **Back up everything you care about.**\nA clean install erases your drive completely. Save documents, photos, bookmarks, and licenses to an external drive or cloud storage.\n2. **Make a list of apps & licenses.**\nNote your Microsoft/Adobe/Office account details and product keys.\n3. **Confirm system compatibility.**\nYour PC must meet Windows 11’s system requirements — 64-bit processor, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB storage, UEFI with Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0.\n4. **Have a stable internet connection.**\nThis helps with activation, updates, and drivers.\n5. **Prepare a USB drive.**\nUse an 8 GB or larger USB flash drive for the installer.\n\n## Step 1 — Download the Installation Media\n\n### Official Media Creation Tool or ISO\n\n1. On another computer, download the **Windows 11 Media Creation Tool** or the **Windows 11 ISO file** from Microsoft’s website.\n2. Use the tool to create a bootable USB drive.\n\n## Step 2 — Prepare Your PC (BIOS/UEFI)\n\n1. **Enter BIOS/UEFI:** Restart your PC and press the setup key (usually F2, F10, Del, or Esc).\n2. **Enable Secure Boot** — Windows 11 requires this setting.\n3. **Enable TPM 2.0:** Look for “PTT” (Intel) or “fTPM” (AMD) in your firmware settings.\n4. **Set USB as the primary boot device** or use the Boot Menu to boot from USB.\n5. Save changes and exit.\n\n## Step 3 — Boot from the USB Installer\n\n1. Insert your bootable Windows 11 USB drive.\n2. Restart your computer and choose to boot from the USB device.\n3. When the Windows Setup screen appears, choose your **language**, **time**, and **keyboard layout**, then click **Next**.\n\n## Step 4 — Perform the Clean Install\n\n1. Click **Install Now**.\n2. When asked for a product key:\n- Enter your key if you have one, or\n- Click **I don’t have a product key** to activate later.\n3. Choose the Windows edition that matches your license.\n4. Select **Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)** — this is the clean install option.\n5. Delete existing partitions:\n- Select each partition on the drive and click **Delete** until only unallocated space remains.\n- Be absolutely sure you’ve backed up your data first.\n6. Select the unallocated space and click **Next** — Windows will create new partitions and begin installing.\n\n## Step 5 — Set Up Windows (OOBE)\n\n1. Choose your region and keyboard layout.\n2. Sign in with your Microsoft account (required for Home edition).\n- If you prefer a local account, disconnect from the internet before setup on Pro edition.\n3. Create a PIN and choose privacy settings.\n4. Wait for Windows to finish setting up and show your desktop.\n\n## Step 6 — After Installation\n\n1. **Install drivers:** Windows Update handles most drivers, but check your manufacturer’s website for chipset, graphics, and network drivers.\n2. **Run Windows Update:** Go to Settings → Windows Update → Check for updates.\n3. **Install your apps:** Reinstall browsers, Office, games, etc.\n4. **Restore your files** from backup.\n5. **Check activation:** Go to Settings → System → Activation.\n6. **Create a recovery drive** once everything is working smoothly.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\n- **USB won’t boot:** Try a different port or verify the drive was created properly.\n- **“This PC can’t run Windows 11” message:** Ensure TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot are enabled.\n- **Activation issues:** If your PC previously ran Windows 11, it should auto-activate online.\n- **Missing drivers:** Use Device Manager to identify missing hardware and download drivers from your manufacturer’s site.\n\n## Final Checklist\n\n✅ Back up data ✅ Confirm TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot ✅ Create bootable USB ✅ Boot and delete old partitions ✅ Install Windows 11 cleanly ✅ Run updates and restore your files\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11-step-by-step/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11-step-by-step/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11-step-by-step/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11-step-by-step/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-clean-install-windows-11-step-by-step/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
