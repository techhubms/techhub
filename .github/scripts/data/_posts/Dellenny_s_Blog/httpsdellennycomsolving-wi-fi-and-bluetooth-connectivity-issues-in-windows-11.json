Whether it’s streaming a movie over Wi-Fi, syncing wireless headphones through Bluetooth, or transferring files across devices, staying connected is essential. But sometimes, Windows 11 users face frustrating issues where Wi-Fi or Bluetooth simply refuses to cooperate.\n\nIf you’ve been struggling with these problems, don’t worry — here’s a comprehensive guide to fixing common Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity issues in Windows 11.\n\n## Common Causes of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Issues\n\nBefore diving into fixes, it’s good to understand what might be going wrong:\n\n- Outdated or corrupted network/Bluetooth drivers\n- Misconfigured system settings\n- Interference from third-party apps or security software\n- Hardware-related issues (faulty adapter, Bluetooth dongle, etc.)\n- Windows updates causing conflicts\n\n## Fixing Wi-Fi Issues in Windows 11\n\n### 1. Check Basic Connections\n\n- Make sure your router is turned on and functioning.\n- Restart your PC and router.\n- Try connecting another device to the same network to see if the issue is PC-specific.\n\n### 2. Toggle Airplane Mode\n\nSometimes, switching **Airplane Mode on and off** can reset network connections.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Network & Internet &gt; Airplane Mode** and toggle it.\n\n### 3. Forget and Reconnect to the Network\n\n- Open **Settings &gt; Network & Internet &gt; Wi-Fi**.\n- Select your network and click **Forget**.\n- Reconnect by entering your password.\n\n### 4. Update Network Drivers\n\n- Right-click the **Start menu** and select **Device Manager**.\n- Expand **Network adapters**.\n- Right-click your Wi-Fi adapter and select **Update driver**.\n- Choose **Search automatically for drivers**.\n\n### 5. Run the Network Troubleshooter\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; System &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Other troubleshooters**.\n- Run the **Internet Connections troubleshooter**.\n\n### 6. Reset Network Settings\n\nIf nothing works, a full reset might help.\n\n- Navigate to **Settings &gt; Network & Internet &gt; Advanced network settings &gt; Network reset**.\n- Click **Reset now** and restart your PC.\n\n## Fixing Bluetooth Issues in Windows 11\n\n### 1. Ensure Bluetooth is Enabled\n\n- Open **Settings &gt; Bluetooth & devices** and toggle Bluetooth on.\n- If it’s already on, try turning it off and on again.\n\n### 2. Re-pair Devices\n\n- Remove the problematic Bluetooth device by clicking **Remove device**.\n- Re-pair it by selecting **Add device &gt; Bluetooth**.\n\n### 3. Update Bluetooth Drivers\n\n- Go to **Device Manager**.\n- Expand **Bluetooth**.\n- Right-click your Bluetooth adapter and select **Update driver**.\n\n### 4. Restart Bluetooth Services\n\n- Press **Win + R**, type `services.msc`\n, and press Enter.\n- Find these services:\n- **Bluetooth Support Service**\n- **Bluetooth Handsfree Service**\n- **Bluetooth Audio Gateway Service**\n- Right-click each and select **Restart**.\n\n### 5. Check for Windows Updates\n\nSometimes, Microsoft patches connectivity issues with updates.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Windows Update** and install pending updates.\n\n## Advanced Fixes (For Both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth)\n\n- **Uninstall and reinstall drivers** if updates don’t help.\n- **Disable power-saving mode**for adapters:\n- In Device Manager, right-click the adapter → **Properties → Power Management** → uncheck *Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power*.\n- **Check BIOS settings** to ensure Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules are enabled.\n\n## When to Seek Hardware Support\n\nIf none of the above solutions work, the issue may be hardware-related. Faulty Wi-Fi cards, antennas, or Bluetooth dongles can cause persistent problems. In that case, contacting your device manufacturer’s support team or considering a replacement adapter may be necessary.\n\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth are essential for smooth workflows and entertainment, but Windows 11 users occasionally face hiccups. By following the steps above, most connectivity issues can be resolved without professional help. Regular driver updates and system maintenance go a long way in preventing future disruptions.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/solving-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-connectivity-issues-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/solving-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-connectivity-issues-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/solving-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-connectivity-issues-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/solving-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-connectivity-issues-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/solving-wi-fi-and-bluetooth-connectivity-issues-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2497)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Optimizing Windows 11 for Gaming Performance](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11gaming.webp?fit=770%2C771&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-windows-11-for-gaming-performance/)\n\n[![Xbox Game Pass Integration and Hidden Features](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xboxgamepass.webp?fit=741%2C739&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/xbox-game-pass-integration-and-hidden-features/)\n\n[![How to Play Xbox Games on Windows 11 Like a Pro](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11xbox.webp?fit=764%2C764&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-play-xbox-games-on-windows-11-like-a-pro/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
