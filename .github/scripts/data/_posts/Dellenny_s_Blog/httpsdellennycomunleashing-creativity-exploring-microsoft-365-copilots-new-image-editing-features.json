Microsoft 365 Copilot is stepping beyond text assistance to empower users with **intelligent image editing and generation tools** built right into familiar Microsoft apps.\n\nWith Copilot’s new image features, you can remove unwanted objects, enhance visuals, restyle photos, or even generate brand-new images — all through natural language commands. Let’s dive into what’s possible today, where the tools live, and how you can make the most of them.\n\n## Where You’ll Find These Features\n\nThe image editing capabilities in Microsoft 365 Copilot are integrated through **Microsoft Designer**, Microsoft’s AI-powered visual design platform.
