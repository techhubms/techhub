You select all, hit delete, and feel relieved… until you try to open your mailbox again and get hit with a dreaded message: **“We’ve temporarily limited your account.”**\n\nWelcome to the world of **Outlook throttling** — Microsoft’s way of protecting its servers (and your account) from overload or suspicious activity. But don’t worry, it’s usually temporary and easy to fix.\n\n### What Is Outlook Throttling?\n\nOutlook and Hotmail use **activity throttling** to prevent abuse or performance issues. When you perform a massive number of actions — like deleting thousands of emails, emptying your “Deleted Items,” or moving large folders — the system sees it as potentially automated activity. To protect the servers, Microsoft slows down or limits further actions from your account for a set period.\n\nThis throttle can prevent you from:\n\n- Opening emails\n- Deleting or moving more items\n- Syncing across devices\n- Accessing your mailbox temporarily\n\n### How Long Does Outlook Throttling Last?\n\nIn most cases, throttling lasts **a few hours to 24 hours**. Rarely, it may extend up to 48 hours if you continue performing heavy actions or sign in repeatedly during the cooldown period.\n\n### What You Can Do to Fix It\n\n1. **Take a Break (Seriously).**\nThe throttle is automatic and time-based. Waiting 12–24 hours is often all it takes to restore full access.\n2. **Avoid Rapid Actions.**\nDon’t repeatedly sign in, refresh, or delete more emails — that can extend the throttle.\n3. **Empty Folders Gradually.**\nIf you still have large folders to clean, delete in batches (500–1000 emails at a time) rather than “Select All.”\n4. **Use a Different Interface.**\nTry accessing Outlook through a different browser, or use the Outlook desktop app. Sometimes throttling is specific to one access point.\n5. **Check for Security Flags.**\nVisit [account.live.com/activity](https://account.live.com/activity) to confirm no suspicious logins are triggering security-based throttles.\n6. **Contact Microsoft Support if It Persists.**\nIf throttling lasts more than 24 hours, head to [Microsoft Outlook Support](https://support.microsoft.com/outlook) and report the issue. Mention that it began after bulk email deletions — support agents can sometimes expedite recovery.\n\n### How to Prevent Throttling in the Future\n\n- **Clean gradually:** Schedule smaller inbox cleanups weekly or monthly.\n- **Use Outlook rules:** Automatically archive or delete older emails.\n- **Avoid mass operations:** Especially from mobile apps or third-party email clients.\n- **Keep Deleted Items tidy:** Empty it regularly instead of all at once.\n\nIf your Outlook or Hotmail account is throttled after mass deletions, don’t panic. It’s Microsoft’s built-in way of maintaining performance and protecting accounts — and it’s **temporary**. Give it time, avoid over-clicking, and your inbox will be back to normal soon.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/why-outlook-locks-you-out-after-deleting-thousands-of-emails-and-how-to-fix-it-fast/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/why-outlook-locks-you-out-after-deleting-thousands-of-emails-and-how-to-fix-it-fast/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/why-outlook-locks-you-out-after-deleting-thousands-of-emails-and-how-to-fix-it-fast/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/why-outlook-locks-you-out-after-deleting-thousands-of-emails-and-how-to-fix-it-fast/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/why-outlook-locks-you-out-after-deleting-thousands-of-emails-and-how-to-fix-it-fast/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
