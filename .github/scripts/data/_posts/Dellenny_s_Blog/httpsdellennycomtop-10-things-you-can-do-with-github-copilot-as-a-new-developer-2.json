It doesn’t just autocomplete code—it helps you learn, experiment, and ship projects faster. Here are the **top 10 things you can do with GitHub Copilot as a new developer**:\n\n## 1. **Get Instant Code Suggestions**\n\nCopilot can complete your lines of code as you type. Whether it’s a function in Python, a React component, or a CSS rule, you’ll get smart, context-aware suggestions that save you time and help you learn coding patterns.\n\n## 2. **Learn by Example**\n\nInstead of memorizing syntax, you can see how Copilot structures code. For example, if you type a comment like *“function to check if a number is prime”*, Copilot will generate a working solution. This makes it a great learning companion.\n\n## 3. **Write Boilerplate Code Quickly**\n\nAs a beginner, setting up a project can be overwhelming. Copilot can generate boilerplate code like server setups, HTML templates, or API routes, so you can focus on the fun parts of coding.\n\n## 4. **Explore New Programming Languages**\n\nWant to try Go, Rust, or TypeScript without starting from scratch? Copilot can generate examples and syntax in unfamiliar languages, giving you a head start when exploring outside your comfort zone.\n\n## 5. **Generate Unit Tests**\n\nTesting is an essential skill, but writing tests can feel repetitive. Copilot can suggest test cases for your functions, helping you understand how to verify your code works as intended.\n\n## 6. **Get Help with Documentation**\n\nStruggling to explain your code? Copilot can draft docstrings, inline comments, or even README sections. It helps you practice writing clear documentation—a critical skill for collaboration.\n\n## 7. **Experiment with Algorithms**\n\nWant to see different ways to solve a problem? Copilot often generates multiple suggestions for the same task, letting you compare approaches and learn best practices.\n\n## 8. **Speed Up Debugging**\n\nWhile Copilot isn’t a debugger, it can suggest fixes when you describe an error in a comment. For example: *“fix function to handle null values”* often results in safer, corrected code.\n\n## 9. **Improve Your Coding Style**\n\nBy analyzing patterns from millions of open-source projects, Copilot often suggests clean, idiomatic code. Following its hints can help you adopt industry-standard practices early in your career.\n\n## 10. **Build Projects Faster**\n\nFrom small scripts to full-stack apps, Copilot helps you move past roadblocks. This means you can build more projects, gain confidence, and focus on learning the “why” behind the code rather than being stuck on the “how.”\n\nGitHub Copilot isn’t a replacement for learning, but it’s a powerful accelerator. As a new developer, you can use it to **practice, explore, and build confidence** while still making the effort to understand the code it generates. Think of it as a pair-programming partner that’s available 24/7.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/top-10-things-you-can-do-with-github-copilot-as-a-new-developer-2/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/top-10-things-you-can-do-with-github-copilot-as-a-new-developer-2/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/top-10-things-you-can-do-with-github-copilot-as-a-new-developer-2/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/top-10-things-you-can-do-with-github-copilot-as-a-new-developer-2/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/top-10-things-you-can-do-with-github-copilot-as-a-new-developer-2/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2512)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How Retail Businesses Are Automating Customer Service with Copilot Studio](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/copilotstudio3.webp?fit=767%2C775&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-retail-businesses-are-automating-customer-service-with-copilot-studio/)\n\n[![How Amazon Q Helps Solution Architects in Their Day-to-Day Tasks](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/amazonq.webp?fit=764%2C767&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-amazon-q-helps-solution-architects-in-their-day-to-day-tasks/)\n\n[![Combining Generative AI and Business Logic with Copilot Studio](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/copilot1.webp?fit=762%2C769&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/combining-generative-ai-and-business-logic-with-copilot-studio/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
