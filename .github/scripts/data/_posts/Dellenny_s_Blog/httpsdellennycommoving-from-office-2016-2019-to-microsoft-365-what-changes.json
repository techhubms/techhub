Below are the key differences you’ll notice, the benefits, and also possible trade-offs to consider.\n\n## What Microsoft 2016/2019 (Perpetual) Provides\n\nBefore looking at what you get *when you move*, let’s recap what you have with Office 2016/2019:\n\n- **One-time purchase**: You pay once for the license; you own that version. No subscription fees.\n- **Fixed feature set**: After release, no new major features are added. You will get security updates and bug fixes, but newer tools and features are reserved for Microsoft 365.\n- **Limited cloud integration**: Some cloud features are available (OneDrive, etc.), but not to the extent Microsoft 365 offers.\n- **Support lifecycle**: Office 2016 and 2019 have defined support periods. After those end, you’ll have no more updates, especially for features or non-security fixes.\n\n## What Microsoft 365 Adds / Changes\n\nWhen you move to Microsoft 365, here’s what differs:\n\n### Licensing & Flexibility\n\n- **Subscription-based**: Instead of a one-off purchase, you pay (usually per user) regularly. This gives you access as long as the subscription is active.\n- **Multiple installations / devices**: Microsoft 365 often permits installing the apps on several devices (PC, Mac, tablets, phones) under the same user account.\n\n### Features & Updates\n\n- **New features regularly**: Microsoft 365 gets ongoing feature updates—new tools, enhancements, and improvements. Office 2019 and 2016 more or less stay where they are after release.\n- **Cloud & collaboration**: Real-time collaboration (co-authoring), version history, sharing via OneDrive, working from different devices, integration with Teams, and more.\n- **More cloud storage**: Microsoft 365 typically includes 1 TB of OneDrive storage per user, making file access from anywhere much easier.\n\n### Support & Security\n\n- **More frequent security & performance updates** plus bug fixes.\n- **Technical & subscription support** from Microsoft as part of the subscription.\n\n### Other Useful Additions\n\n- **New apps & services**: Some apps are only in Microsoft 365 (Teams, AI tools, advanced Excel functions, Editor, etc.).\n- **Cross-device work**: Because of cloud syncing, mobile apps, and browser-based versions, it’s easier to work on the go, share documents, and collaborate.\n\n## What Changes You’ll Need to Manage / Trade-Offs\n\nIt’s not all free lunch. Moving to Microsoft 365 means:\n\n- **Continuing cost**: Subscriptions mean ongoing payments; over time these costs may exceed what you paid once for the perpetual license.\n- **Dependence on internet / cloud services**: Many features are cloud-based, so reliable connectivity helps.\n- **Change management / user training**: Regular updates mean users may need to adapt to UI changes or new workflows.\n- **Data management / security / compliance**: With cloud storage and collaboration comes more responsibility for permissions, backups, and compliance.\n- **Compatibility / feature differences**: Some perpetual Office features may behave differently or need updating for Microsoft 365.\n\n## Timing & Strategic Reasons to Move\n\nYou might consider moving when:\n\n- Your current version is approaching end of support.\n- You need better collaboration, remote, or hybrid work support.\n- You want access to newer features (especially those powered by AI and cloud).\n- Your team uses multiple devices or works outside the office often.\n\n## Case Examples / What You’ll Actually Notice\n\nHere are concrete differences users often experience after switching:\n\n| Before (Office 2016/2019) | After (Microsoft 365) | | --- | --- | | Saving files locally or in shared drives; version control via manual file sharing | Auto-save, version history in OneDrive/SharePoint; edit everywhere | | Waiting for major releases (every few years) for new features | Features arrive continuously (e.g. new Excel functions, refreshed UIs, AI tools) | | Limited collaboration (co-editing slow or awkward) | Real-time co-authoring, better commenting, easier sharing | | Mobile/web versions are limited or separate | Seamless experience across devices, better features in mobile/web apps | | One install per machine; may need separate license or purchase for new version | License per user, install on multiple devices, across PC, Mac, and mobile |\n\n## What to Plan in the Transition\n\nIf you decide to move, here are things to plan for:\n\n1. **License & Cost Analysis**: Review how many users and which subscription plan you need.\n2. **Inventory Existing Tools/Add-ons**: Check compatibility of macros, templates, and integrations.\n3. **Data Migration / File Location**: Move files to OneDrive/SharePoint, set up structure and permissions.\n4. **Training & Communication**: Prepare users for new features and workflows.\n5. **Security & Compliance Setup**: Configure permissions, MFA, and data protection.\n6. **Device/Network Readiness**: Ensure devices and internet connections can handle cloud features.\n\nMoving from Office 2016/2019 to Microsoft 365 isn’t just a software update — it’s a paradigm shift. You trade a fixed license for a subscription, pay continuously, but in return get flexibility, new features, better collaboration, stronger cloud integration, and more modern security. For many organizations and individuals, the benefits outweigh the costs — especially as Office 2016/2019 reach end of support.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2584)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Top 10 Windows 11 Tips Every Beginner Should Know](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11starttoptips.webp?fit=708%2C726&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/)\n\n[![How to Reconfigure the Hidden Context Menu and Unlock Power Tweaks in Windows](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11contextmenu.webp?fit=709%2C703&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/)\n\n[![Unlocking Hidden Superpowers in Windows 11 Speech, Eye, and Voice Access Tools You Didn’t Know You Had](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-4.png?fit=713%2C614&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/unlocking-hidden-superpowers-in-windows-11-speech-eye-and-voice-access-tools-you-didnt-know-you-had/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
