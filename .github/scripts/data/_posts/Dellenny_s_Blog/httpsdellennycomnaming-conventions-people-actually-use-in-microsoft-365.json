Naming conventions that look good in policy documents but fall apart in day-to-day use.\n\nThe good news: you can design conventions that are **practical, simple, and easy for people to actually follow**. Here are some steps to make it work.\n\n## 1. Start With the People, Not the Policy\n\nBefore creating a 10-page document about acronyms and abbreviations, talk to the people who will use these names daily. Ask:\n\n- How do you search for files or Teams today?\n- What makes it easy (or frustrating) to find things?\n- What’s “natural” in their department’s language?\n\nA naming convention that ignores how people already think and search won’t last.\n\n## 2. Define Scope: Where Do Naming Conventions Apply?\n\nMicrosoft 365 includes a lot of services where names matter:\n\n- **Teams & Microsoft 365 Groups**\n- **SharePoint sites & libraries**\n- **OneDrive folders (shared)**\n- **Planner boards**\n- **Power BI workspaces**\n- **Files**\n\nDon’t try to control everything at once. Start with Teams and SharePoint site names—they impact navigation and search the most.\n\n## 3. Keep It Short and Predictable\n\nLengthy, complex names get ignored. Instead, focus on a **short structure that helps people immediately know what they’re looking at**.\n\nExample structure for Teams: `[Department] – [Purpose/Project]`\n\n- HR – Policies\n- Finance – Budget FY25\n- IT – Project Phoenix\n\nFor SharePoint libraries or folders: `[Category]_[Year]_[Short Descriptor]`\n\n- Reports\\_2025\\_Q1\n- Contracts\\_2024\\_Vendors\n\n## 4. Use Prefixes and Suffixes Wisely\n\nPrefixes or suffixes help organize names consistently in search and alphabetical lists.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Add **“ARCHIVE”** to old projects: `ARCHIVE – Marketing – 2023 Campaigns`\n- Add **“EXT”** for external collaboration: `Sales – Partners EXT`\n\nThis makes it obvious at a glance and avoids hidden mistakes.\n\n## 5. Agree on Abbreviations (But Don’t Overdo It)\n\nNothing kills usability like everyone inventing their own acronyms. Decide on a short **approved abbreviation list** for departments, years, and project phases.\n\nExamples:\n\n- HR, FIN, IT, MKT\n- FY25 (not “FiscalYear2025” or “2025Budget”)\n- PH1, PH2, PH3 for project phases\n\nThe trick: keep the list short enough to remember without needing a manual.\n\n## 6. Balance Governance With Flexibility\n\nToo much governance = people bypass it. Too little governance = chaos.\n\nPractical tips:\n\n- Use **naming policies** in Microsoft 365 (via Azure AD) to automatically add prefixes/suffixes like department tags.\n- Provide **templates** or starter Teams/sites with naming pre-filled.\n- Offer **guidance in plain language** instead of a rigid 20-rule document.\n\n## 7. Communicate and Reinforce, Don’t Just Publish\n\nThe best naming convention is useless if it’s buried in SharePoint. Instead:\n\n- Show examples during onboarding.\n- Remind users when new Teams are created.\n- Celebrate good practices—call out when a well-named site makes life easier.\n\nNaming should feel like a productivity tool, not a compliance exercise.\n\n## 8. Review and Adjust Over Time\n\nWhat works today may not work a year from now. Schedule a **lightweight review** every 6–12 months:\n\n- Are people still following the convention?\n- Are new needs (like external collaboration) creating gaps?\n- Can anything be simplified?\n\nYour convention should evolve just like your organization.\n\nThe goal of a naming convention isn’t perfection—it’s **consistency that saves time**. When people can find the right Team, site, or file without frustration, the convention is working.\n\nKeep it short. Keep it human. Keep it flexible. That’s how you design naming conventions in Microsoft 365 that people actually follow.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/naming-conventions-people-actually-use-in-microsoft-365/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/naming-conventions-people-actually-use-in-microsoft-365/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/naming-conventions-people-actually-use-in-microsoft-365/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/naming-conventions-people-actually-use-in-microsoft-365/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/naming-conventions-people-actually-use-in-microsoft-365/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2536)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Overcoming “Microsoft Teams Fatigue” and Keeping Communication Effective](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/teamsfatigue.webp?fit=719%2C732&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/overcoming-microsoft-teams-fatigue-and-keeping-communication-effective/)\n\n[![Using Microsoft 365 Effectively in Education Without Overloading Teachers](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365teachers1.webp?fit=724%2C726&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/using-microsoft-365-effectively-in-education-without-overloading-teachers/)\n\n[![Unlock Marketing Superpowers with Copilot in Microsoft 365 A Step-by-Step Guide](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/marketing1.webp?fit=719%2C707&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/unlock-marketing-superpowers-with-copilot-in-microsoft-365-a-step-by-step-guide/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
