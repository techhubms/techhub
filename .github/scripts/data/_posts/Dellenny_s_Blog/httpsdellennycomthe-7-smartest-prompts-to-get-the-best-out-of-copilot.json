But just like any tool, the quality of what you get depends on how you use it — or, in this case, what you *ask* for.\n\nThe secret to unlocking Copilot’s full potential lies in your *prompts.* Think of prompts as instructions for your digital teammate. The clearer and smarter they are, the better Copilot can anticipate your needs and deliver meaningful results.\n\nLet’s explore **7 of the smartest prompts** you can use to supercharge your workflow.\n\n## **1. “Write a function that [specific task], with [specific constraints].”**\n\nInstead of saying:\n\n> >\n> *“Write a function for sorting numbers.”*\n> >\n\nTry:\n\n> >\n> *“Write a Python function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order without using built-in sort(), and include time complexity in comments.”*\n> >\n\n💡 **Why it works:** Specific constraints and context help Copilot focus. You’ll get a more optimized, explainable, and context-aware snippet.\n\n## **2. “Explain this code step by step like I’m a junior developer.”**\n\nIf you’re working with unfamiliar code, prompt Copilot to *teach* you:\n\n> >\n> *“Explain this JavaScript code line by line as if I’m new to React.”*\n> >\n\n💡 **Pro Tip:** This is perfect for onboarding or when you’re diving into legacy code. Copilot turns into an interactive tutor that simplifies complex logic.\n\n## **3. “Suggest better variable names and refactor this code for readability.”**\n\nReadable code is maintainable code. Ask Copilot to clean up:\n\n> >\n> *“Refactor this Python function to use clearer variable names and follow PEP 8 style.”*\n> >\n\n💡 **Why it works:** Copilot isn’t just a code generator — it’s a style consultant. You’ll end up with cleaner, more professional code that your teammates will thank you for.\n\n## **4. “Generate test cases for this function using [framework].”**\n\nTesting is critical but often tedious. You can automate much of it:\n\n> >\n> *“Generate unit tests for this TypeScript function using Jest.”*\n> >\n\n💡 **Pro Tip:** Ask Copilot to include edge cases or error handling — it often catches scenarios you might overlook.\n\n## **5. “Write a docstring or documentation for this code block.”**\n\nDocumentation is a developer’s best friend — and Copilot writes it beautifully when asked:\n\n> >\n> *“Write a concise docstring for this function in NumPy style.”*\n> >\n\n💡 **Why it works:** You instantly get clean, standardized documentation. Bonus: it’s great for teams that want consistency across codebases.\n\n## **6. “Optimize this code for performance and explain your changes.”**\n\nSometimes you need more than working code — you need *faster* code:\n\n> >\n> *“Optimize this SQL query for large datasets and explain each optimization.”*\n> >\n\n💡 **Why it works:** Copilot can identify redundant operations, inefficient loops, or unindexed queries — and teach you why the new version is better.\n\n## **7. “Brainstorm ideas for how to implement [feature or system].”**\n\nCopilot isn’t limited to coding — it’s a great brainstorming partner:\n\n> >\n> *“Brainstorm three approaches to implementing a role-based access control system in Django.”*\n> >\n\n💡 **Pro Tip:** Use this early in your design phase to explore different architectures or trade-offs before you start building.\n\nCopilot isn’t here to replace developers — it’s here to *amplify* them. The best results come when you treat it like a skilled pair programmer: give it context, direction, and clear intent.\n\nNext time you open your editor, remember: 🧠 *Smart prompts = Smart code.*\n\nStart experimenting with these 7 prompts today and watch your productivity — and your code quality — soar.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/the-7-smartest-prompts-to-get-the-best-out-of-copilot/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/the-7-smartest-prompts-to-get-the-best-out-of-copilot/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/the-7-smartest-prompts-to-get-the-best-out-of-copilot/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/the-7-smartest-prompts-to-get-the-best-out-of-copilot/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/the-7-smartest-prompts-to-get-the-best-out-of-copilot/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2910)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Unleashing Creativity Exploring Microsoft 365 Copilot’s New Image Editing Features](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Unleashing-Creativity-Exploring-Microsoft-365-Copi.webp?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/unleashing-creativity-exploring-microsoft-365-copilots-new-image-editing-features/)\n\n[![The Future of SharePoint AI, Agents, and Smarter Collaboration (2025 Update)](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SharePointAI.webp?fit=775%2C763&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/the-future-of-sharepoint-ai-agents-and-smarter-collaboration-2025-update/)\n\n[![Microsoft 365 Copilot vs Other AI Tools The Game-Changer for Modern Businesses](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m365copilotvsAI.webp?fit=771%2C753&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-copilot-vs-other-ai-tools-the-game-changer-for-modern-businesses/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2910)\n\n%d",
