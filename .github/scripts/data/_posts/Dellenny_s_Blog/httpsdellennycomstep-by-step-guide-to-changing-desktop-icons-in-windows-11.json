One of the simplest ways to make your PC feel more like *you* is to **change your desktop icons**.\n\nWhether you want a minimalist setup, a colorful aesthetic, or a professional-looking desktop, Windows 11 makes it easy to customize system icons, folder icons, and shortcut icons.\n\nIn this detailed **step-by-step guide**, you’ll learn exactly how to change desktop icons in Windows 11, use custom icon packs, and even fix common icon-related issues. Let’s get started!\n\n## **Why Change Desktop Icons in Windows 11?**\n\nBefore we dive into the steps, let’s talk about why this is worth doing.\n\nPersonalizing your desktop icons can:\n\n- **Improve productivity** by making it easier to identify apps and folders.\n- **Add a unique style** that matches your wallpaper or theme.\n- **Create an aesthetic desktop setup** that’s clean and visually appealing.\n- **Organize better**, especially if you use custom icons for work, gaming, or personal projects.\n\nWindows 11’s sleek design is great, but a little customization can make it even better.\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Changing Desktop Icons in Windows 11\n\n### **Step 1: Open the Desktop Icon Settings**\n\nWindows 11 hides the desktop icon settings a bit deeper than previous versions, but it’s easy to access once you know how.\n\n1. Right-click anywhere on your desktop and select **Personalize**.\n2. In the left sidebar, click on **Themes**.\n3. Scroll down and find **Related Settings**.\n4. Click **Desktop icon settings**.\n\nYou’ll see a window pop up titled *Desktop Icon Settings*. This is where you can manage icons like:\n\n- This PC\n- Recycle Bin\n- Network\n- Control Panel\n- User’s Files\n\n### **Step 2: Choose Which Icon to Change**\n\nInside the **Desktop Icon Settings** window:\n\n1. Select the system icon you want to change — for example, **This PC** or **Recycle Bin**.\n2. Click on the **Change Icon…** button below the list.\n\nThis opens a new window showing a collection of default Windows icons stored in the `shell32.dll` file. You can select one of these or browse for your own custom icons.\n\n### **Step 3: Browse and Use Custom Icons**\n\nIf you’d like something unique, you can download or design custom icons. To use a custom icon:\n\n1. Click **Browse…** in the *Change Icon* window.\n2. Navigate to the location of your custom **.ico** file.\n3. Select the file and click **Open**.\n4. You’ll now see your custom icon previewed in the list.\n\n>\n> 💡 **Tip:** Make sure your icon file is in **.ico format**, as Windows does not support PNG or JPG directly for desktop icons.\n> If you only have PNG images, you can convert them to .ico using free online tools like **ConvertICO** or **ICOConvert**.\n>\n\n### **Step 4: Apply and Save the Changes**\n\nOnce you’ve selected your new icon:\n\n1. Click **OK** to confirm.\n2. Click **Apply**, then **OK** again to close the settings window.\n\nYour desktop icon will now instantly change to the new design!\n\nIf the icon doesn’t appear right away, try right-clicking on the desktop and choosing **Refresh**.\n\n## **How to Change Folder Icons in Windows 11**\n\nChanging individual folder icons helps you organize your files visually — perfect for grouping work folders, personal projects, or games.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\n1. Right-click on the folder you want to customize.\n2. Select **Properties**.\n3. Click the **Customize** tab.\n4. Under the *Folder Icons* section, click **Change Icon…**.\n5. Browse for your custom **.ico** file or pick one from the list.\n6. Click **OK**, then **Apply**, and **OK** again.\n\nNow your folder will display your chosen icon both on the desktop and in File Explorer.\n\n## **Using Icon Packs and Themes in Windows 11**\n\nIf you want a consistent look across all your icons, consider using **Windows 11 icon packs**. These packs include sets of matching icons for system folders, shortcuts, and apps.\n\n**How to install icon packs:**\n\n1. Download a reputable pack from sites like **DeviantArt**, **IconArchive**, or **Flaticon**.\n2. Extract the files — they usually contain multiple `.ico`\nfiles.\n3. Replace your icons manually using the steps above, or use software like **IconPackager** or **7TSP** for automatic installation.\n\n>\n> ⚠️ **Note:** Only download icon packs from trusted sources to avoid malware or corrupted system files.\n>\n\n## **How to Create Your Own Custom Icons**\n\nIf you want a truly personal touch, why not design your own icons?\n\nHere’s how:\n\n1. **Design your icon** in tools like **Canva**, **Figma**, or **Adobe Illustrator**. Keep it simple and square-shaped (512×512 px works best).\n2. **Export the design** as a transparent PNG.\n3. **Convert the PNG** to an ICO file using an online converter.\n4. **Apply your new icon** following the steps above.\n\nNow you’ve got a one-of-a-kind desktop setup that perfectly matches your aesthetic or workflow.\n\n## **How to Restore Default Windows 11 Icons**\n\nIf you want to go back to the original Windows icons:\n\n1. Open **Desktop Icon Settings** again (via *Personalize → Themes → Desktop Icon Settings*).\n2. Select the icon you changed.\n3. Click **Restore Default**.\n4. Click **Apply** → **OK**.\n\nAll your icons will revert to their original look instantly.\n\n## **Troubleshooting Common Icon Issues in Windows 11**\n\n**1. Icon Not Updating?** Try refreshing your desktop or restarting File Explorer:\n\n- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.\n- Find **Windows Explorer**, right-click, and select **Restart**.\n\n**2. Blurry or Low-Resolution Icons?** Use high-quality icons (256×256 px or larger). Smaller icons can appear pixelated on high-resolution monitors.\n\n**3. Icons Reverting After Restart?** Make sure you have administrative privileges and your icons are stored in a permanent directory (not a removable drive).\n\nChanging desktop icons in Windows 11 is one of the easiest ways to personalize your PC. Whether you prefer sleek monochrome icons or colorful ones that pop, Windows gives you full control over your desktop’s appearance.\n\nYou can modify **system icons**, **folder icons**, or even **shortcut icons** to create a consistent and visually appealing setup that boosts both aesthetics and productivity.\n\nWith just a few clicks — and maybe a cool icon pack — your Windows 11 desktop can look like a reflection of *you*.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-guide-to-changing-desktop-icons-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-guide-to-changing-desktop-icons-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-guide-to-changing-desktop-icons-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-guide-to-changing-desktop-icons-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/step-by-step-guide-to-changing-desktop-icons-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[Windows 11](https://dellenny.com/tag/windows-11/ \"Windows 11\")\n\n[previousHow to Disable or Customize Transparency Effects in Windows 11 – Full Guide](https://dellenny.com/how-to-disable-or-customize-transparency-effects-in-windows-11-full-guide/)\n\n%d",
