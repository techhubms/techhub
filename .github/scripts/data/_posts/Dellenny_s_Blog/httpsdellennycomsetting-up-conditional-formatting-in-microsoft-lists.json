But beyond just storing data, Lists also lets you **visually highlight important details** using **conditional formatting** ‚Äî a feature that can make your lists more intuitive and actionable at a glance.\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôll walk through what conditional formatting is, why it‚Äôs useful, and how you can set it up step by step.\n\n### What Is Conditional Formatting?\n\nConditional formatting allows you to automatically change how list items look ‚Äî such as their color, font, or background ‚Äî based on the values in specific columns.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Highlight overdue tasks in **red**\n- Mark completed items in **green**\n- Shade high-priority items in **yellow**\n- Add icons or status bars to visually represent progress\n\nThis kind of visual cue helps users quickly understand what‚Äôs important without reading every entry.\n\n### Why Use Conditional Formatting?\n\nConditional formatting helps:\n\n- **Improve readability** ‚Äì instantly see what needs attention\n- **Enhance productivity** ‚Äì prioritize tasks without manual filtering\n- **Support decision-making** ‚Äì visualize status, performance, or deadlines\n\n### How to Set Up Conditional Formatting in Microsoft Lists\n\n#### Step 1: Open Your List\n\nGo to your **Microsoft List** within SharePoint or the Lists app in Microsoft 365. Choose the list you want to format.\n\n#### Step 2: Switch to Format Mode\n\n1. Click the **column header** you want to format.\n2. Select **Column settings ‚Üí Format this column**.\n\nThis opens the formatting pane on the right-hand side.\n\n#### Step 3: Choose ‚ÄúConditional Formatting‚Äù\n\nIn the formatting pane:\n\n- Select **Conditional formatting**.\n- Click **+ Add rule** to create your first condition.\n\n#### Step 4: Define Your Condition\n\nYou can set rules based on:\n\n- Text values (e.g., ‚Äúequals‚Äù, ‚Äúcontains‚Äù, ‚Äúbegins with‚Äù)\n- Number ranges (e.g., ‚Äúgreater than‚Äù, ‚Äúless than‚Äù)\n- Dates (e.g., ‚Äúbefore‚Äù, ‚Äúafter‚Äù, ‚Äúis today‚Äù)\n\nExample:\n\n> >\n> If **Status** equals **Completed**, then set the background color to **green**.\n> >\n\nYou can create multiple rules for a single column.\n\n#### Step 5: Apply Formatting\n\nChoose the **color**, **font style**, or **icon** to apply when the condition is met. Options include:\n\n- Text color\n- Background color\n- Bold/italic font\n- Data bar\n- Icons (for visual indicators)\n\n#### Step 6: Save and View\n\nOnce done, click **Save**. Your list items will now visually reflect the rules you‚Äôve created!\n\n### Pro Tip: Use JSON for Advanced Formatting\n\nIf you want even more control (for example, to format entire rows or use complex logic), you can switch to **‚ÄúAdvanced mode‚Äù** and apply **custom JSON formatting**.\n\nMicrosoft provides templates you can copy and modify directly from the official [JSON formatting documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/declarative-customization/column-formatting).\n\n### ü™Ñ Example Use Cases\n\n| Scenario | Rule | Visual Result | | --- | --- | --- | | Task Management | Status = ‚ÄúOverdue‚Äù | Red background | | Issue Tracking | Priority = ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù | Orange highlight | | Sales Pipeline | Deal Value &gt; $50,000 | Bold text with üí∞ icon | | Event Planning | Date = Today | Blue border |\n\nConditional formatting transforms your Microsoft Lists from plain data into a **dynamic, visual dashboard**. Whether you‚Äôre tracking projects, managing tasks, or organizing events, it ensures that important details *pop out immediately* ‚Äî helping teams stay informed and responsive.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-conditional-formatting-in-microsoft-lists/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-conditional-formatting-in-microsoft-lists/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-conditional-formatting-in-microsoft-lists/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-conditional-formatting-in-microsoft-lists/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-conditional-formatting-in-microsoft-lists/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2915)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Maintaining Productivity During Hybrid or Phased Rollouts in Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m365rollout2.webp?fit=768%2C769&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/maintaining-productivity-during-hybrid-or-phased-rollouts-in-microsoft-365/)\n\n[![Elevating Employee Experience with Microsoft Viva Insights](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/viva1.webp?fit=766%2C752&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/elevating-employee-experience-with-microsoft-viva-insights/)\n\n[![Microsoft 365 Companion Apps for Windows 11 A New Way to Stay Productive](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m365comoanionapp.webp?fit=767%2C749&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-companion-apps-for-windows-11-a-new-way-to-stay-productive/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2915)\n\n%d",
