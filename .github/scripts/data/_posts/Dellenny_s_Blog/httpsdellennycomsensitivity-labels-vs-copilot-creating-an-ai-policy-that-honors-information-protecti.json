  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content As organizations embrace Microsoft Copilot to accelerate productivity and creativity, a new challenge emerges: how do we ensure that AI-generated summaries, emails, and documents continue to respect corporate information protection policies?\n\nMicrosoft Information Protection (MIP) provides the foundation for classifying and securing data with **sensitivity labels**—but when Copilot starts creating content, that foundation needs reinforcement. The key question is: *how do we make sure Copilot understands and applies those same labels correctly?*\n\nLet’s unpack how MIP and Copilot interact, where the risks lie, and how to build an AI policy that keeps sensitive data protected without slowing down innovation.\n\n## **Understanding the Players: MIP and Copilot**\n\n### **Microsoft Information Protection (MIP)**\n\nMIP is Microsoft’s framework for discovering, classifying, labeling, and protecting sensitive data. It helps organizations apply consistent policies across Microsoft 365 using **sensitivity labels**—for example, *Public*, *Confidential*, *Highly Confidential – Finance*, etc.\n\nSensitivity labels can:\n\n- Encrypt and restrict access to content\n- Apply watermarks or headers\n- Enforce data loss prevention (DLP) rules\n- Integrate with compliance tools for tracking and reporting\n\nThese labels persist with the document or email, even when shared externally, making them central to a zero-trust information strategy.\n\n### **Microsoft Copilot**\n\nCopilot is Microsoft’s generative AI assistant embedded across 365 apps—Word, Excel, Outlook, Teams, and more. It reads and generates content using the data you have access to.\n\nCopilot doesn’t inherently “know” sensitivity—it relies on the permissions and protections already defined by MIP and your data governance configuration. That’s why **AI governance and MIP governance must work hand in hand.**\n\n## **The Risk: When AI Creates New Content**\n\nCopilot can summarize an internal report, draft a customer email, or generate a PowerPoint deck. Each of those actions produces *new* content, and new content must carry the *right* sensitivity label.\n\nWithout guardrails, Copilot could:\n\n- Generate unclassified documents from sensitive source material\n- Suggest summaries that inadvertently expose confidential details\n- Save drafts without the correct encryption or access restrictions\n\nTo prevent data leakage, organizations need to make sure that sensitivity labels **travel with the context** Copilot is using.\n\n## **Best Practices: Ensuring Copilot Honors MIP Labels**\n\n### **1. Enable Label Inheritance and Default Labeling**\n\nConfigure your MIP policies so that newly created files inherit sensitivity labels from the source content.\n\nFor example:\n\n- When Copilot summarizes a “Confidential – HR” document in Word, the resulting draft should automatically carry the same label.\n- When Copilot creates a new email based on sensitive Teams chat content, the email inherits the label.\n\nDefault labeling ensures that even if a user forgets—or Copilot doesn’t explicitly apply one—the baseline sensitivity is enforced.\n\n### **2. Use Auto-Labeling with AI-Generated Content**\n\nMicrosoft Purview supports **auto-labeling** based on content inspection and context. Extend this to Copilot scenarios by:\n\n- Turning on auto-labeling for Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive\n- Using trainable classifiers to detect sensitive data types (e.g., PII, contracts, M&A data)\n- Defining rules that label new or modified files created through Copilot\n\nThis ensures Copilot-generated text is automatically classified even when the AI creates it from mixed sources.\n\n### **3. Educate Users: Copilot Reflects Their Access**\n\nCopilot respects user permissions—if an employee doesn’t have access to a file, Copilot won’t either. However, users need to understand that *AI mirrors their data privileges.*\n\nTraining should include:\n\n- How sensitivity labels control what Copilot can use\n- Why applying labels promptly affects Copilot’s outputs\n- When and how to manually verify or correct labels after generation\n\nAn informed user is the best safeguard against unintentional data exposure.\n\n### **4. Create an AI + Information Protection Governance Policy**\n\nYour Copilot rollout should include a formal AI governance policy that aligns with your MIP framework.\n\nThis policy should define:\n\n- How Copilot-generated content is labeled and stored\n- Responsibilities for reviewing AI-generated drafts before sharing\n- Exceptions and escalation paths for label conflicts\n- Monitoring and auditing processes in Purview\n\nBy integrating Copilot into your existing compliance architecture, you ensure both productivity and protection.\n\n### **5. Audit and Monitor AI Data Flows**\n\nLeverage **Microsoft Purview audit logs** and **Defender for Cloud Apps** to monitor how AI-generated content moves through your environment.\n\nLook for:\n\n- Documents generated by Copilot without labels\n- Downgrading of labels during edits\n- Unusual sharing or access patterns\n\nAI policies should include periodic reviews to confirm that sensitivity labels remain consistent across Copilot workflows.\n\n## **Looking Ahead: Building a Trustworthy AI Ecosystem**\n\nThe integration between Copilot and Microsoft Information Protection is evolving rapidly. Microsoft continues to enhance native label support in Copilot interactions—eventually enabling direct sensitivity awareness in AI outputs.\n\nUntil then, the best defense is proactive governance: align your MIP setup, labeling automation, and user training with how Copilot generates and saves content.\n\nWhen done right, you can empower your workforce with AI **without compromising compliance or confidentiality**.\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n\n- MIP sensitivity labels remain the cornerstone of information protection.\n- Copilot relies on existing MIP configurations—so governance alignment is essential.\n- Use inheritance, auto-labeling, and user education to ensure consistent protection.\n- Integrate AI activity into your MIP monitoring and auditing processes.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/sensitivity-labels-vs-copilot-creating-an-ai-policy-that-honors-information-protection-mip/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/sensitivity-labels-vs-copilot-creating-an-ai-policy-that-honors-information-protection-mip/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/sensitivity-labels-vs-copilot-creating-an-ai-policy-that-honors-information-protection-mip/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/sensitivity-labels-vs-copilot-creating-an-ai-policy-that-honors-information-protection-mip/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/sensitivity-labels-vs-copilot-creating-an-ai-policy-that-honors-information-protection-mip/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3092)\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3092)\n\n%d",
