  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content Getting a new PC or upgrading to **Windows 11** is exciting — Microsoft’s latest operating system offers a sleek design, improved performance, and lots of customization options. But before you dive in, there are a few important steps to take to make sure your system runs smoothly, securely, and just the way you like it.\n\nHere are the **15 essential things to do when setting up Windows 11 for the first time**.\n\n## 1. Complete Initial Setup Carefully\n\nDuring the first boot, Windows 11 walks you through setting up your region, keyboard layout, and account. **Tip:** Use a Microsoft Account to sync settings, OneDrive, and Microsoft Store apps across devices. If you prefer privacy, choose an offline local account.\n\n## 2. Check for Windows Updates\n\nGo to **Settings → Windows Update** and click **Check for updates**. Microsoft frequently releases patches that fix bugs, improve performance, and enhance security — it’s best to start fully updated.\n\n## 3. Install Device Drivers\n\nWindows 11 automatically installs most drivers, but for better performance, visit your PC manufacturer’s website (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.) to download the latest graphics, Wi-Fi, and chipset drivers.\n\n## 4. Adjust Privacy Settings\n\nWindows 11 collects some data for diagnostics and personalization. Go to **Settings → Privacy & Security** to manage what data is shared, disable advertising ID tracking, and limit background app permissions.\n\n## 5. Uninstall Unwanted Apps (Bloatware)\n\nWindows 11 may come with preinstalled apps you don’t need. Open **Settings → Apps → Installed apps**, and remove things like trialware or redundant utilities to free up space and declutter your Start menu.\n\n## 6. Customize the Start Menu and Taskbar\n\nRight-click the **Taskbar → Taskbar settings** to personalize it. You can move the icons to the left (classic layout), hide widgets, and pin or unpin apps from the Start menu to create a cleaner workspace.\n\n## 7. Enable Dark Mode (or Light Mode)\n\nGo to **Settings → Personalization → Colors** and choose between light, dark, or custom modes. Dark mode reduces eye strain and can even improve battery life on OLED displays.\n\n## 8. Set Up OneDrive or Cloud Storage\n\nWindows 11 integrates seamlessly with OneDrive. Turn it on to automatically back up your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders. You can also install alternatives like Google Drive or Dropbox.\n\n## 9. Install Essential Apps\n\nInstall the must-haves:\n\n- **Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, or Brave\n- **Media player:** VLC\n- **Productivity:** Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, or Google Workspace\n- **Security:** Password manager or antivirus (if not relying on Windows Defender)\n\n## 10. Configure Windows Defender and Firewall\n\nWindows 11’s built-in security is strong, but you should ensure it’s active. Open **Windows Security → Virus & threat protection** and verify real-time protection and the firewall are turned on.\n\n## 11. Set Up File History or Backup\n\nProtect your files by setting up **File History** (Settings → System → Storage → Advanced storage settings). You can use an external drive or cloud service to automatically back up important data.\n\n## 12. Sync Clipboard and Settings Across Devices\n\nSign in with your Microsoft account and enable **Clipboard history** and **Sync across devices** under **System → Clipboard**. This helps you copy and paste text between your PC and phone.\n\n## 13. Optimize Power & Performance Settings\n\nUnder **Settings → System → Power & battery**, you can select a balanced, best performance, or battery saver mode. Desktop users often prefer *Best performance*, while laptops benefit from *Balanced* mode for battery life.\n\n## 14. Explore Widgets and Snap Layouts\n\nWindows 11 introduces **Snap layouts** (hover over the maximize button) for easy window organization, and **Widgets** for quick access to weather, news, and calendar updates. Try them — they make multitasking smoother.\n\n## 15. Create a Restore Point\n\nBefore installing lots of software, create a **System Restore Point**. Go to **Control Panel → System → System protection → Create**. This ensures you can roll back your system if something goes wrong later.\n\nSetting up Windows 11 properly takes a bit of time, but these steps ensure you start with a clean, secure, and optimized environment. Once done, you’ll enjoy a faster, safer, and more personalized computing experience.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-windows-11-for-the-first-time-15-things-you-should-do/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-windows-11-for-the-first-time-15-things-you-should-do/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-windows-11-for-the-first-time-15-things-you-should-do/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-windows-11-for-the-first-time-15-things-you-should-do/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-windows-11-for-the-first-time-15-things-you-should-do/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
