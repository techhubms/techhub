Whether your system feels slow, apps take too long to load, or you just want to optimize your workflow, leveraging these native tools can give you a significant performance boost.\n\nHereâ€™s a guide to the most effective built-in tools in Windows 11 to maximize speed and efficiency.\n\n## 1. Task Manager: Monitor and Control Performance\n\nThe **Task Manager** is your first stop for diagnosing performance issues.\n\n- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open it.\n- Go to the **Performance tab** to see CPU, memory, disk, and GPU usage in real time.\n- In the **Processes tab**, end apps that are consuming too many resources.\n\nðŸ’¡ Pro tip: Right-click on the **Startup tab** to disable unnecessary programs from launching automatically.\n\n## 2. Storage Sense: Free Up Disk Space Automatically\n\nWindows 11 includes **Storage Sense**, which automatically cleans temporary files and manages space.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage**.\n- Enable **Storage Sense** to run automatically or trigger it manually.\n- Use the **Cleanup recommendations** option to remove large and unused files.\n\nA decluttered disk often translates into smoother performance.\n\n## 3. Windows Security & Device Performance Health\n\nWindows 11 comes with **Windows Security**, which not only protects from viruses but also monitors system health.\n\n- Open **Windows Security &gt; Device performance & health**.\n- Check for storage issues, battery efficiency, or Windows updates that may impact performance.\n\nKeeping your system up-to-date prevents slowdowns from outdated drivers or security gaps.\n\n## 4. Power & Battery Settings: Optimize for Speed\n\nWindows 11 lets you balance performance with energy use.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; System &gt; Power & battery**.\n- Under **Power mode**, switch to **Best performance** (when plugged in).\n\nThis gives your system more resources for demanding tasks like gaming, video editing, or multitasking.\n\n## 5. Performance Troubleshooter\n\nInstead of manually digging for problems, Windows has a **built-in troubleshooter**.\n\n- Open **Settings &gt; System &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Other troubleshooters**.\n- Run troubleshooters for performance-related issues like power, updates, or hardware.\n\nThese automated checks often fix slowdowns you might overlook.\n\n## 6. Disk Defragment & Optimize Drives\n\nOver time, data on your hard drive can become fragmented. Windows includes a tool to fix this.\n\n- Search **Defragment and Optimize Drives** in the Start menu.\n- Select your drive and click **Optimize**.\n\nðŸ’¡ Note: If youâ€™re on an SSD, Windows uses TRIM instead of defragmentation, which helps maintain speed.\n\n## 7. Focus Assist: Reduce Distractions for Better Productivity\n\nPerformance isnâ€™t just about your PCâ€”itâ€™s about your focus.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; System &gt; Focus assist**.\n- Choose **Priority only** or **Alarms only** to silence notifications during work sessions.\n\nPair it with the **Clock appâ€™s Focus sessions** to build distraction-free deep work routines.\n\n## 8. Command Prompt & PowerShell for Advanced Users\n\nIf you want to dig deeper:\n\n- Use **sfc /scannow** in Command Prompt to scan and repair corrupted system files.\n- Use **DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth** to restore system health.\n- In PowerShell, you can manage startup apps, monitor processes, and automate maintenance tasks.\n\nWindows 11 is designed with performance optimization in mindâ€”you just need to take advantage of the tools built right in. By combining **Task Manager monitoring**, **Storage Sense cleanup**, **Power mode tuning**, and **Focus assist**, youâ€™ll notice a significant improvement in both speed and productivity.\n\nBefore downloading third-party cleaners or optimizers, try these native featuresâ€”theyâ€™re safe, effective, and already part of your system.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2416)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Optimize Battery Life on Windows 11 Laptops](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11Battery.webp?fit=686%2C687&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/)\n\n[![Troubleshooting Common Windows 11 Issues](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/windows11.webp?fit=692%2C686&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/troubleshooting-common-windows-11-issues/)\n\n[![Best Windows 11 Widgets (and How to Add Them)](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/powerpages.png?fit=706%2C692&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/best-windows-11-widgets-and-how-to-add-them/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
