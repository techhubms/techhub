Rebranding & Evolution\n\n- As of November 15, 2023, **Power Virtual Agents** officially became part of the newly introduced **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, marking a pivotal shift in Microsoft’s conversational AI strategy.\n- This isn’t merely a renaming—it’s a transformation into a broader, more powerful platform that incorporates generative AI, multi-channel deployment, and deep integration across Microsoft 365 and Azure ecosystems.\n\n### 2. Expanded Capabilities & AI Advancements\n\n- **Generative AI & Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** While PVA primarily relied on predefined triggers and templates, Copilot Studio introduces AI-generated responses using GPT-based models. You can create or modify conversational topics simply by describing your needs in natural language.\n- **Plugin & Data Integration:** Copilot Studio enables seamless connections to your data via pre-built or custom plugins—whether through Azure, APIs, Microsoft 365, or third-party sources—allowing for richer, actionable chatbot experiences.\n- **Workflow & Agent Orchestration:** The platform supports orchestrated, multi-step agent workflows managed centrally—far exceeding PVA’s simpler, topic-based bots.\n\n### 3. Broader Deployment & Reach\n\n- Agents built in Copilot Studio can now be deployed across a wide variety of channels—including websites, mobile apps, Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, and beyond—extending far beyond PVA’s typical scope.\n\n### 4. Licensing & User Impact\n\n- Existing PVA customers enjoy **no disruptions**: all their bots and work continue to function, now under the Copilot Studio interface.\n- The **PVA license** has been replaced by the **Copilot Studio license**, offering the same functionality plus new generative AI capabilities.\n- Flexible pricing is offered via capacity-based messaging packs ($200/month per 25,000 messages) or pay-as-you-go billing—both inclusive of full product capability.\n\n### 5. Cutting-Edge Automation via “Computer Use”\n\n- In April 2025, Microsoft launched a game-changing **“computer use”** feature in Copilot Studio: AI agents can now interact directly with websites and desktop apps—clicking buttons, typing into fields, and adapting dynamically if UI elements change—even when no API is available.\n\n### 6. Customer Stories & Use Cases\n\n- Organizations like the **Miami Dolphins**, **Kobe City (Japan)**, and **Rabobank** previously built effective solutions using PVA.\n- With Copilot Studio, broader adoption is visible: **Pets at Home**, **Holland America Line**, **Virgin Money**, **Nsure.com**, and **ABN AMRO** have praised its ability to accelerate complex, AI-driven agent creation across channels.\n\n## Summary Table: PVA vs. Copilot Studio\n\n| Feature / Capability | Power Virtual Agents (PVA) | Copilot Studio | | --- | --- | --- | | **Branding & Platform** | Standalone chatbot tool on Power Platform | Fully integrated conversational AI studio | | **Conversational Logic** | Trigger phrases, topics, templates | Generative AI + NLU-enabled topic generation | | **Integration** | Basic connectors via Power Automate, etc. | Deep plugin support and data integration | | **Deployment Channels** | Limited (e.g., Teams, web) | Web, mobile apps, Teams, MS 365, custom apps | | **Licensing** | PVA-specific license | Copilot Studio license with pay-as-you-go options | | **Enhanced Automation** | No direct UI automation | “Computer use” feature for UI-level automation | | **Continuity for Users** | N/A | Smooth transition—existing bots active in Studio |\n\n## What This Means for Businesses & Users\n\n- **PVA users:** You’re in good shape—your bots are still working, now under Copilot Studio, with expanded AI functionality and better cross-channel reach.\n- **New users:** Copilot Studio offers low-code ease, rich integration, workflow orchestration, generative intelligence, and powerful automation features—making it far more versatile than the legacy PVA.\n- **Best of both worlds:** You retain the simplicity and accessibility of PVA but gain modern, scalable AI enhancements.\n\nIn essence, **Copilot Studio is the next-generation evolution of Power Virtual Agents**—a leap forward in conversational AI. It preserves PVA’s low-code appeal while unlocking advanced generative capabilities, broader integrations, richer deployment options, and innovative automation tools. Whether for internal tools, customer service, or complex workflows, Copilot Studio is where AI-driven virtual assistants now thrive.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/copilot-studio-vs-power-virtual-agents-whats-changed/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/copilot-studio-vs-power-virtual-agents-whats-changed/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/copilot-studio-vs-power-virtual-agents-whats-changed/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/copilot-studio-vs-power-virtual-agents-whats-changed/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/copilot-studio-vs-power-virtual-agents-whats-changed/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2281)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![No-Code AI How Non-Developers Can Build Smart Chatbots with Copilot Studio](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copilotstudio1.webp?fit=763%2C734&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/no-code-ai-how-non-developers-can-build-smart-chatbots-with-copilot-studio/)\n\n[![Top 5 Use Cases for Copilot Studio in Your Business](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copilotstudio2.webp?fit=712%2C696&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/top-5-use-cases-for-copilot-studio-in-your-business/)\n\n[![How Enterprises Are Using Microsoft Copilot to Boost Productivity, Drive Innovation, and Gain a Competitive Edge](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/m365Copilot.webp?fit=695%2C438&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-enterprises-are-using-microsoft-copilot-to-boost-productivity-drive-innovation-and-gain-a-competitive-edge/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
