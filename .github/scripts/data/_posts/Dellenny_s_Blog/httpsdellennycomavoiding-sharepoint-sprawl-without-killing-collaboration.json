Its flexibility is a blessing—teams can create sites, share documents, and manage projects with ease. But without governance, that same flexibility can quickly turn into **SharePoint sprawl**: a maze of redundant sites, duplicated files, and forgotten content that frustrates users and undermines productivity.\n\nThe challenge is clear: how do you prevent sprawl *without* choking the collaboration SharePoint was designed to enable?\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\n## What is SharePoint Sprawl?\n\nSprawl happens when SharePoint environments grow unchecked. Signs include:\n\n- Dozens of nearly identical team sites\n- Confusing folder structures with multiple “Final” versions of the same document\n- Orphaned sites no longer actively used but still consuming space\n- Lack of clarity about where the “single source of truth” lives\n\nIn other words, SharePoint stops being a helpful tool and becomes digital clutter.\n\n## Why Simply Locking It Down Doesn’t Work\n\nSome organizations try to fight sprawl with strict controls: limiting site creation, requiring IT approval for every new library, or imposing rigid structures. While this prevents chaos, it often **kills the very collaboration** SharePoint enables. Employees start working around the system—using email attachments, local drives, or shadow IT solutions—making things even worse.\n\nThe key isn’t control; it’s **guided freedom**.\n\n## Strategies to Avoid Sprawl (Without Killing Collaboration)\n\n### 1. Establish Clear Governance—But Keep It Light\n\nGovernance doesn’t mean bureaucracy. Create simple guidelines that answer:\n\n- When should a new site be created?\n- Who owns the site and its content?\n- What’s the lifecycle (review, archive, delete)?\n\nBy setting these expectations early, you give teams freedom within a structure.\n\n### 2. Empower Site Owners\n\nInstead of funneling every request through IT, train and empower site owners. Give them checklists or templates for creating and maintaining sites, so they can keep collaboration smooth *and* consistent.\n\n### 3. Use Templates and Naming Conventions\n\nConsistent site templates reduce clutter. Standard naming conventions (e.g., “HR-Recruiting” vs. just “Recruiting”) make it easier to navigate and avoid duplicate sites.\n\n### 4. Automate Where Possible\n\nLeverage tools like Microsoft 365 groups, retention policies, and automated lifecycle management. For example, sites that haven’t been accessed in 12 months can be flagged for review. Automation prevents buildup without requiring manual policing.\n\n### 5. Encourage Search Over Storage\n\nInstead of relying on endless folders, encourage metadata tagging and search. This helps users find what they need quickly and reduces the temptation to create duplicate sites.\n\n### 6. Make Archiving Part of the Culture\n\nJust like spring cleaning, content should be reviewed regularly. Build archiving and deletion into the rhythm of your organization—quarterly reviews, annual audits, or project-closeout checklists.\n\nAvoiding SharePoint sprawl doesn’t mean locking down collaboration. It’s about striking the balance between **freedom and structure**. By putting light but clear governance in place, empowering site owners, and using automation wisely, organizations can keep SharePoint clean, organized, and—most importantly—collaborative.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/avoiding-sharepoint-sprawl-without-killing-collaboration/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/avoiding-sharepoint-sprawl-without-killing-collaboration/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/avoiding-sharepoint-sprawl-without-killing-collaboration/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/avoiding-sharepoint-sprawl-without-killing-collaboration/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/avoiding-sharepoint-sprawl-without-killing-collaboration/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2482)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Common Mistakes When Upgrading from Older Office Versions to Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/office365migration.webp?fit=784%2C779&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/common-mistakes-when-upgrading-from-older-office-versions-to-microsoft-365/)\n\n[![What to Do When SharePoint Search Doesn’t Return the Right Results](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sharepointsearch.webp?fit=773%2C770&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/what-to-do-when-sharepoint-search-doesnt-return-the-right-results/)\n\n[![Accessibility Features in Microsoft 365 That Most Admins Forget to Enable](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/integration.png?fit=710%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/accessibility-features-in-microsoft-365-that-most-admins-forget-to-enable/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
