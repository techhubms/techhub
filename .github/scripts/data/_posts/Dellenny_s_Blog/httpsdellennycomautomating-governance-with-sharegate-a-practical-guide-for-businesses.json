However, as organizations grow and adopt tools like Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive, governance often becomes a challenge. Without a clear governance strategy, businesses risk sprawl, compliance issues, and inefficiencies.\n\nThis is where **ShareGate** comes in. Beyond migration, ShareGate provides powerful automation for **Microsoft 365 governance**—helping organizations manage, monitor, and secure their environments at scale.\n\nIn this post, we’ll break down:\n\n- Why governance matters\n- How ShareGate automates governance\n- Step-by-step guide to setting it up\n- Business benefits of adopting automated governance\n\n## Why Governance Matters in Microsoft 365\n\nAs usage grows, organizations face challenges like:\n\n- **Team sprawl:** Too many inactive or duplicate Teams and SharePoint sites.\n- **Data compliance risks:** Sensitive data shared without oversight.\n- **Ownership gaps:** Teams or sites without clear owners.\n- **User frustration:** Difficulties finding the right resources due to poor structure.\n\nGovernance ensures that your environment remains secure, compliant, and user-friendly—without slowing down productivity.\n\n## How ShareGate Automates Governance\n\nShareGate’s governance features focus on **monitoring, automating, and delegating**. Instead of IT manually tracking every Team or site, ShareGate allows policies to be set up and enforced automatically. Key capabilities include:\n\n- **Lifecycle management:** Archive, delete, or review inactive Teams and sites.\n- **Ownership management:** Identify orphaned Teams/sites and assign new owners.\n- **External sharing monitoring:** Detect and manage external users or guest access.\n- **Reporting & alerts:** Regular insights into usage, security, and compliance.\n- **Automation rules:** Trigger actions (like owner review) based on policies.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide to Automating Governance with ShareGate\n\n### Step 1: **Set Up ShareGate**\n\n- Install ShareGate Desktop or connect via ShareGate Apricot (cloud governance solution).\n- Authenticate with global admin credentials to integrate with your Microsoft 365 tenant.\n\n### Step 2: **Discover Your Environment**\n\n- Run an **inventory scan** to identify existing Teams, SharePoint sites, owners, and usage patterns.\n- Use built-in reports (inactive teams, orphaned groups, external sharing) to get a governance baseline.\n\n### Step 3: **Define Governance Policies**\n\n- Work with stakeholders to define policies such as:\n- When should inactive Teams be archived?\n- How often should ownership reviews happen?\n- Should external sharing be restricted or monitored?\n- Configure these policies directly in ShareGate.\n\n### Step 4: **Automate Lifecycle Management**\n\n- Enable rules to automatically detect **inactive Teams/sites** and send notifications to owners.\n- Allow owners to **decide whether to keep, archive, or delete** their resources.\n- Ensure archived Teams are stored securely for compliance.\n\n### Step 5: **Automate Ownership Management**\n\n- Use automation to flag **orphaned Teams**.\n- Set up rules to automatically assign secondary owners or request new ones from team members.\n\n### Step 6: **Monitor External Sharing**\n\n- Enable regular reports to track guest access and external sharing.\n- Automate alerts to notify owners when external users are added.\n- Apply restrictions where necessary to ensure compliance.\n\n### Step 7: **Ongoing Monitoring & Optimization**\n\n- Review ShareGate’s dashboard regularly for trends and risks.\n- Adjust governance policies as your business evolves.\n- Provide owners with self-service governance so IT isn’t a bottleneck.\n\n## Business Benefits of Automated Governance with ShareGate\n\n1. **Reduced IT Workload**\n- No more manual cleanup of inactive Teams/sites.\n- Automated alerts and workflows save hours of administrative effort.\n2. **Improved Security & Compliance**\n- Proactive monitoring prevents unauthorized access and data leaks.\n- Compliance-friendly archiving ensures data is managed responsibly.\n3. **Better User Experience**\n- Employees find the right Teams/sites faster with less clutter.\n- Owners take responsibility for governance, empowering collaboration.\n4. **Cost Optimization**\n- Eliminates storage bloat by cleaning up unused resources.\n- Keeps licensing and infrastructure costs under control.\n5. **Future-Proof Collaboration**\n- Governance policies scale as your organization grows.\n- IT can focus on strategic projects instead of firefighting sprawl.\n\nGovernance doesn’t have to be a burden. With ShareGate, businesses can **automate policies, delegate responsibilities, and maintain a secure, organized Microsoft 365 environment**—all without slowing down collaboration.\n\nIf your organization struggles with Teams sprawl, ownership gaps, or compliance risks, automating governance with ShareGate is a smart move.
