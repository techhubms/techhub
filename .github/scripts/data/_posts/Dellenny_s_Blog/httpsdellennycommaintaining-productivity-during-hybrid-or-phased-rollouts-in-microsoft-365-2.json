Whether you‚Äôre migrating from on-prem systems, introducing new collaboration tools, or enabling hybrid work capabilities, phased or hybrid rollouts are the norm.\n\nHowever, these staggered deployments come with a common challenge: **how do you maintain productivity and minimize disruption when not everyone is on the same page ‚Äî or platform ‚Äî yet?**\n\nBelow are practical strategies and best practices to help your teams stay productive, connected, and confident throughout your M365 rollout.\n\n### **1. Start With Clear Communication**\n\nA phased rollout can cause confusion if users aren‚Äôt sure *what‚Äôs changing* and *when*. Before each deployment wave, communicate early and clearly:\n\n- **What‚Äôs happening:** Outline which tools or features are being introduced (e.g., Teams, SharePoint Online, OneDrive).\n- **Who‚Äôs affected:** Specify which departments or user groups are part of the phase.\n- **When it‚Äôs happening:** Share key dates and milestones.\n- **What support is available:** Include links to FAQs, training materials, and contact points for help.\n\nüí° *Tip:* Use Microsoft Viva Engage or Teams Announcements to broadcast updates and maintain a steady information flow.\n\n### **2. Empower Early Adopters**\n\nEarly adopters can make or break a phased rollout. Identify champions within each department who can:\n\n- Test new tools before full release.\n- Provide feedback to IT and change management teams.\n- Support their peers with real-world tips and enthusiasm.\n\nThese champions act as *in-house advocates*, helping accelerate adoption and reduce reliance on IT support.\n\n### **3. Leverage Hybrid Connectivity**\n\nDuring hybrid rollouts, users might be split between on-prem and cloud environments. Ensure interoperability so collaboration isn‚Äôt disrupted:\n\n- Enable **hybrid Exchange and SharePoint configurations** for smooth coexistence.\n- Configure **Teams to support guest access and cross-tenant collaboration**.\n- Use **OneDrive Known Folder Move** to bridge the gap between local file storage and the cloud.\n\nMaintaining hybrid connectivity ensures users can share, chat, and collaborate ‚Äî regardless of where their data currently lives.\n\n### **4. Prioritize Training and Self-Service Learning**\n\nTraining shouldn‚Äôt just be a one-time event. In phased rollouts, learning needs to evolve with each stage:\n\n- Offer **bite-sized, role-based training** via Microsoft Learning Pathways or Viva Learning.\n- Record **short ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù videos** for common tasks (e.g., saving files in OneDrive, scheduling Teams meetings).\n- Encourage a **self-service culture** using resources like Microsoft 365 support articles and community forums.\n\nWhen users feel equipped and empowered, productivity naturally follows.\n\n### **5. Monitor Adoption and Feedback in Real Time**\n\nVisibility is key during a phased rollout. Leverage M365 analytics tools to measure usage, engagement, and satisfaction:\n\n- **Microsoft 365 Adoption Score** for tracking collaboration and communication trends.\n- **Power BI dashboards** for custom reporting across departments.\n- **Forms or Viva Pulse surveys** to collect direct user feedback.\n\nThis data allows you to adjust rollout timelines, prioritize feature training, and identify roadblocks early.\n\n### **6. Balance Innovation with Stability**\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to enable every new feature at once, but a measured approach sustains productivity. Balance innovation with operational stability:\n\n- Pilot advanced features (like Copilot, Loop, or Viva modules) in controlled groups.\n- Maintain version control and governance to avoid ‚Äútool sprawl.‚Äù\n- Regularly review policies for Teams lifecycle management, data retention, and access control.\n\nKeeping a structured governance model ensures your M365 environment grows sustainably ‚Äî without chaos.\n\n### **7. Celebrate Milestones**\n\nDon‚Äôt underestimate the morale boost of recognition. Celebrate successful rollouts, departmental adoptions, and team milestones. Simple shoutouts in Teams or internal newsletters can:\n\n- Reinforce positive behavior.\n- Encourage other groups to engage.\n- Build a sense of progress and shared ownership.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/maintaining-productivity-during-hybrid-or-phased-rollouts-in-microsoft-365-2/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/maintaining-productivity-during-hybrid-or-phased-rollouts-in-microsoft-365-2/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/maintaining-productivity-during-hybrid-or-phased-rollouts-in-microsoft-365-2/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/maintaining-productivity-during-hybrid-or-phased-rollouts-in-microsoft-365-2/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/maintaining-productivity-during-hybrid-or-phased-rollouts-in-microsoft-365-2/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email‚Ä¶\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Microsoft 365 Tips for Non-Profits with Limited Budgets](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m365nonprofit1.webp?fit=772%2C395&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-tips-for-non-profits-with-limited-budgets/)\n\n[![Setting Up Conditional Formatting in Microsoft Lists](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MicrosoftListsConditionalFormating.webp?fit=763%2C766&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-conditional-formatting-in-microsoft-lists/)\n\n[![Maintaining Productivity During Hybrid or Phased Rollouts in Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m365rollout2.webp?fit=768%2C769&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/maintaining-productivity-during-hybrid-or-phased-rollouts-in-microsoft-365/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
