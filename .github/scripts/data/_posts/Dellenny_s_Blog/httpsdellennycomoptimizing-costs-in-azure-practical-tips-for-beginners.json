But after a month of usage, that excitement sometimes turns into shock when the bill arrives. Azure is powerful, but it can get expensive if you’re not paying attention.\n\nThe good news? Controlling your cloud costs isn’t difficult once you understand what drives your bill and how Azure helps you monitor and optimize usage. This guide is written for beginners who may not have much experience with cloud pricing models. We’ll walk through practical, real-world tips that help you keep spending in line without sacrificing performance.\n\n## **Start With the Azure Cost Management Tools**\n\nAzure has built-in cost management features that many beginners don’t realize exist. Before you optimize anything, you need visibility.\n\nInside the **Azure Portal**, open **Cost Management + Billing**, and you’ll find dashboards showing exactly where your money is going. From there, you can:\n\n- View current and forecasted spending\n- Break down usage by resource, tags, project, or department\n- Track spending trends over time\n- Set alerts and budgets\n\nEven if you do nothing else, checking this dashboard weekly teaches you how your consumption patterns are evolving. Most cost issues come from services that were left running without anyone realizing. Alerts and automated budgets can warn you before spending gets out of hand.\n\n## **Use Budgets and Cost Alerts Early**\n\nAzure lets you set a monthly or quarterly budget, then trigger alerts when spending reaches milestones like 50%, 75%, or 100% of the amount.\n\nFor beginners, this is incredibly helpful. It creates spending guardrails, especially when experimenting with virtual machines or storage services.\n\nFor example:\n\n- You’re testing a new VM for a sandbox environment.\n- You accidentally choose a larger VM size than needed.\n- After a week, your spending hits 70% of the monthly budget.\n- Azure sends you an alert before the bill snowballs.\n\nThis safety net is simple, helpful, and underused by new Azure users.\n\n## **Right-Size Your Virtual Machines**\n\nVirtual machines are one of the biggest contributors to cost. It’s easy to spin up a powerful machine “just in case,” only to realize you’re barely using 10% of the resources.\n\nTo optimize VM spending:\n\n- Review CPU, memory, and disk utilization regularly.\n- If usage is consistently low, consider a smaller VM size.\n- Use Azure Advisor to get recommendations based on real performance.\n\nMany companies save 20–40% just by resizing unused or oversized VMs.\n\n## **Shut Down Non-Production Resources Automatically**\n\nA classic beginner mistake is leaving test or dev environments running at night or over the weekend.\n\nIf no one is using those resources 24/7, why pay for them 24/7?\n\nAzure lets you set:\n\n- Auto-shutdown schedules for virtual machines\n- Start/stop automation using Azure Automation\n- Policies that enforce power schedules across teams\n\nEven turning off VMs 12 hours a day can cut their monthly cost in half. It’s one of the easiest ways to save money without changing performance or setup.\n\n## **Use Azure Reservations for Long-Term Savings**\n\nIf you know you’ll be using a VM or service consistently, Azure Reservations can reduce costs dramatically—sometimes by more than 70%.\n\nYou pre-commit to one or three years of usage and get a big discount compared to pay-as-you-go pricing.\n\nThis is ideal for:\n\n- Long-term workloads\n- Always-on applications\n- Predictable usage patterns\n\nIt’s not always the right choice during experimentation, but once a workload is stable, reservations can provide serious savings.\n\n## **Don’t Forget About Storage Costs**\n\nStorage looks cheap at first glance, but it adds up when left unmanaged. Consider the following tips:\n\n### **1. Delete Old or Unused Blobs**\n\nOver time, logs, backups, and test data pile up. Review them monthly and delete what isn’t needed.\n\n### **2. Move Inactive Data to Cheaper Storage Tiers**\n\nAzure offers several tiers:\n\n- Hot (most expensive, frequent access)\n- Cool (cheaper, infrequent access)\n- Archive (very cheap, rarely accessed)\n\nIf you only download logs once every few months, archive storage can save a surprising amount.\n\n### **3. Review Redundancy Requirements**\n\nGeo-redundant storage sounds great, but not every dataset needs global availability. If local redundancy is enough, costs drop right away.\n\n## **Use Serverless and PaaS Services When Possible**\n\nRunning entire VMs for small applications isn’t always efficient. Serverless and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) options can dramatically reduce costs because you only pay for actual usage—not idle time.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- Azure Functions\n- Azure App Service\n- Cosmos DB serverless\n- Logic Apps\n\nMany small applications and automation tasks fit perfectly into these services, especially early in development.\n\n## **Clean Up “Zombie Resources”**\n\nOne of the hidden sources of wasted money in Azure is leftover services that no one remembers.\n\nA typical example:\n\n- A VM is deleted\n- But the NIC, public IP, disk, or backup snapshot remains\n- These still cost money\n\nAzure Resource Graph or simple resource list reviews help identify unused components. Make it a habit to delete them when shutting down workloads.\n\n## **Use Tagging for Cost Accountability**\n\nTags help associate resources with:\n\n- Projects\n- Teams\n- Departments\n- Cost centers\n\nWhen you filter spending reports by tags, it becomes immediately obvious which areas are responsible for cost increases.\n\nFor larger organizations, tagging enables better accountability and budgeting. For smaller teams, it makes cost management faster and clearer.\n\n## **Review Your Bill Regularly**\n\nCloud bills can grow slowly and silently. A 10-minute check once a week can save hundreds or thousands down the road. Look for:\n\n- Spikes in spending\n- Unusual usage trends\n- Services costing more than expected\n- Resources that no longer need to be running\n\nEven simple oversight goes a long way.\n\nAzure is an impressive cloud platform, but the freedom it provides can lead to uncontrolled costs if you’re not paying attention. Luckily, most cost issues are easy to fix once you know where to look.\n\nAs a beginner, focus on:\n\n- Using the cost management tools\n- Reviewing usage regularly\n- Eliminating waste\n- Right-sizing resources\n- Taking advantage of automation\n\nWith just a few adjustments and a bit of ongoing attention, you can enjoy the full power of Azure without getting billing surprises.\n\nIf you keep monitoring and improving gradually, cost optimization becomes a natural part of working in the cloud—and not something you scramble to fix later.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-costs-in-azure-practical-tips-for-beginners/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-costs-in-azure-practical-tips-for-beginners/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-costs-in-azure-practical-tips-for-beginners/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-costs-in-azure-practical-tips-for-beginners/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/optimizing-costs-in-azure-practical-tips-for-beginners/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3592)\n\nTags:[Azure](https://dellenny.com/tag/azure-2/ \"Azure\")\n\n[previousAzure Support Plans Compared Choosing the Right One for Your Organization](https://dellenny.com/azure-support-plans-compared-choosing-the-right-one-for-your-organization/)\n\n[nextExploring Azure Portal, CLI, and PowerShell — Which One Should You Use?](https://dellenny.com/exploring-azure-portal-cli-and-powershell-which-one-should-you-use/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3592)\n\n%d"
