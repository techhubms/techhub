You *know* the insights are in there somewhere… the trend that matters, the weird outlier, the formula that will finally make the numbers make sense. But digging them out can feel like you need a data science degree—and two quiet hours with no interruptions. I’ve been there too. I’ve spent more mornings than I’d like to admit wrestling with complex VLOOKUPs or manually sorting through hundreds of comments. Exhausting, right?\n\nThe good news? We’re living in the future now. Microsoft Copilot for Excel can swoop in and save the day. Instead of building formulas and charts by hand, you can just ask for what you want in plain English and get useful results instantly. Think of it like having a super-smart data analyst sitting next to you who never gets tired and is totally fine doing the boring parts.\n\nBut here’s the thing—just like talking to a real analyst, how you ask your question matters. If you want great answers, you need clear, specific prompts. A little finesse goes a long way.\n\nReady to stop melting your brain with formulas and start getting more from your data? Let’s dig into how to write great prompts that unlock everything Copilot can do.\n\n🛠️ Step 1: Format Your Data as a Table Before you even open the Copilot chat window, do one essential thing: Format your data as a table.\n\nSeriously—don’t skip it. Copilot works best when your data is clean and structured. If you just have a messy sheet full of random cells, the AI won’t know where the data begins, what the headers are, or how columns relate to each other.\n\nQuick refresher:\n\n1. Select your data\n2. Go to **Home**\n3. Click **Format as Table**\n4. Make sure **“My table has headers”** is selected\n\nClear headers are Copilot’s roadmap. Once your table is ready, click the Copilot button on the Home ribbon and you’re in business.\n\n🗣️ Step 2: Learn the Art of a Great Prompt Typing a question into Copilot isn’t just… typing a question. You need context and direction if you want a high-quality response. In Excel, you can communicate with Copilot in two ways:\n\n- The chat pane (for analysis, summaries, and visualizations)\n- The `=COPILOT()`\nfunction (for formulas and cell-level results)\n\nLet’s focus on the chat pane.\n\n### 1. Be Specific\n\nA vague prompt will get a vague answer.\n\n❌ Too vague: “Tell me about my sales data.”\n\n✔ Much better: “Show me the top 5 product categories by total revenue in Q3 of last year, and suggest a formula to calculate gross margin for the Electronics category.”\n\nA strong prompt includes:\n\n- Action: *Show me, calculate, create*\n- Data references: *product category, total revenue*\n- Filters: *Q3, Electronics*\n- Expected result: *Top 5, formula*\n\n### 2. Ask “Why” and “What If”\n\nThis is where Copilot shines. Instead of just summarizing:\n\n- Identify trends:\n“What is the average customer spend for users who signed up in the last six months, and which regions are underperforming?”\n- Explain changes:\n“Why did subscription renewals drop between March and April? Highlight the data points that contributed most to the decline.”\n- Model scenarios:\n“If shipping costs increased by 15%, how would that affect Net Profit? Add a column showing the new numbers.”\n\n### 3. Ask for the Output Format You Want\n\nIf you want a chart, PivotTable, or formatted result—say so.\n\nExamples:\n\n- “Create a PivotTable grouping employees by department and showing total expenses.”\n- “Give me a line chart of monthly sales for the past year to show seasonal trends.”\n\nLet Copilot analyze the data *and* build the output in one go.\n\n💡 Real-World Prompt Ideas (Feel Free to Copy)\n\n### Scenario A: Sales & Finance\n\n- **Calculate Profit Margin**\n“Suggest a formula for a new ‘Gross Margin’ column that calculates the percentage difference between Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold.”\n- **Find Top Performers**\n“Which sales rep consistently exceeded their targets last quarter, and what was their average deal size?”\n- **Forecasting**\n“Based on Units Sold over the last 18 months, forecast the next three quarters and create a chart comparing actuals to projections.”\n\n### Scenario B: Surveys & Text Data\n\n- **Categorize Feedback**\n“Review the Customer Comments column and categorize each entry as Product, Shipping, or Support. Add a new column with the category.”\n- **Summarize Text**\n“Summarize the feedback from cells A2 through A50 into one concise paragraph.”\n\n### Scenario C: Data Cleaning\n\n- **Find Duplicates**\n“Highlight any rows where Customer ID appears more than once.”\n- **Fix Date Formats**\n“Reformat all dates in the Order Date column into DD-MM-YYYY.”\n\n🔮 Where All This Is Heading Honestly, it feels like we’re on the edge of a big shift. Soon, we’ll spend less time building spreadsheets and more time *talking* to them. Instead of focusing on formulas, we’ll focus on insights—and Copilot is already making advanced analysis available to everyone, not just Excel power users.\n\nStart with small questions, keep your data structured, and don’t be afraid to experiment. You’ve got this—and your spreadsheets are about to get a whole lot smarter.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/stop-guessing-your-guide-to-asking-copilot-questions-about-your-spreadsheets/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/stop-guessing-your-guide-to-asking-copilot-questions-about-your-spreadsheets/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/stop-guessing-your-guide-to-asking-copilot-questions-about-your-spreadsheets/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/stop-guessing-your-guide-to-asking-copilot-questions-about-your-spreadsheets/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/stop-guessing-your-guide-to-asking-copilot-questions-about-your-spreadsheets/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3586)\n\nTags:[Artificial Intelligence](https://dellenny.com/tag/artificial-intelligence-2/ \"Artificial Intelligence\")[M365 Copilot](https://dellenny.com/tag/m365-copilot/ \"M365 Copilot\")\n\n[previousAI Terms Explained for Microsoft 365 Users](https://dellenny.com/ai-terms-explained-for-microsoft-365-users/)\n\n[nextAzure Support Plans Compared Choosing the Right One for Your Organization](https://dellenny.com/azure-support-plans-compared-choosing-the-right-one-for-your-organization/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3586)\n\n%d"
