  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content When Microsoft announced **Windows 11**, one of the biggest talking points wasn’t its sleek design or new features—it was the system requirements. Many users were left wondering: *Will my PC run it?* Let’s break down what you really need in plain English.\n\n## 1. Processor (CPU)\n\nYour computer’s brain needs to be:\n\n- **1 GHz or faster**, with **2 or more cores**\n- On a **64-bit processor** or **System on a Chip (SoC)**\n- And **on Microsoft’s approved list** (this includes most Intel 8th Gen, AMD Ryzen 2000+, and newer chips)\n\n🧠 *In simple terms:* If your PC was built after 2018, you’re probably fine. Older machines might not make the cut.\n\n## 2. RAM\n\n- Minimum: **4 GB**\n\n💡 *What this means:* You need at least 4 GB of memory for Windows 11 to run smoothly. If you use lots of tabs or multitask, aim for **8 GB or more**.\n\n## 3. Storage\n\n- Minimum: **64 GB of free space**\n\n💾 *Translation:* Windows 11 itself takes up around 20–30 GB, but updates and apps need room to breathe. Ideally, have at least **100 GB free**.\n\n## 4. System Firmware\n\n- Must support **UEFI** and **Secure Boot**\n\n🔒 *Why it matters:* This improves security and helps prevent malware from starting before your system boots. Most PCs made in the last few years already support this—just make sure it’s turned on in the BIOS.\n\n## 5. TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module)\n\nThis tiny chip adds an extra layer of security, storing sensitive data like encryption keys.\n\n🧩 *If you’re unsure:* Check your PC’s BIOS for “TPM 2.0” or “fTPM.” Many newer systems have it built in, but it may just need enabling.\n\n## 6. Graphics Card (GPU)\n\n- Must be compatible with **DirectX 12** or later, with a **WDDM 2.0 driver**\n\n🎮 *In everyday terms:* Any modern integrated or dedicated graphics card from the last 5–6 years should work fine.\n\n## 7. Display\n\n- At least **9-inch screen**, **720p resolution**, and **8 bits per color channel**\n\n🖥️ *Basically:* Almost any monitor or laptop screen will qualify—nothing special needed here.\n\n## 8. Internet Connection & Microsoft Account\n\n- Required for **setup** and **updates** on Home edition\n\n🌐 *So yes:* You’ll need an internet connection to complete installation and sign in with (or create) a Microsoft account.\n\nWindows 11 is designed for **modern, secure, and efficient** hardware. While its requirements may seem strict, they help ensure better performance and stronger protection against threats.\n\n✅ **Quick checklist to see if you’re ready:**\n\n- PC built after 2018\n- 8th Gen Intel / Ryzen 2000+ CPU\n- TPM 2.0 enabled\n- Secure Boot on\n- At least 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-system-requirements-explained-simply/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-system-requirements-explained-simply/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-system-requirements-explained-simply/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-system-requirements-explained-simply/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-system-requirements-explained-simply/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
