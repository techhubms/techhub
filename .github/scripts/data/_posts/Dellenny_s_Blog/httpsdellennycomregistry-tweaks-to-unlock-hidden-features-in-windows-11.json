Many of these can be unlocked or fine-tuned using the **Windows Registry** — a powerful database that controls system behavior.\n\n⚠️ **Warning:** Editing the Windows Registry incorrectly can cause system instability. Always back up your registry (via *File &gt; Export* in Registry Editor) or create a System Restore point before making changes.\n\n## 1. Bring Back the Classic Right-Click Context Menu\n\nWindows 11 replaced the traditional right-click menu with a simplified version, hiding many options under “Show more options.” If you prefer the classic menu:\n\n- Open **Registry Editor** (`regedit`\n).\n- Navigate to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID`\n- Right-click **CLSID**, choose **New &gt; Key**, and rename it: `{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}`\n- Inside that, create another key called **InprocServer32**.\n- Double-click the **(Default)** value inside it, leave the field blank, and press **OK**.\n- Restart your PC.\n\nNow, right-click menus will default to the old style.\n\n## 2. Disable Lock Screen Background Blur\n\nIf you dislike the frosted glass effect on the lock screen:\n\n- Go to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System`\n- Create a new **DWORD (32-bit)** value named: `DisableAcrylicBackgroundOnLogon`\n- Set its value to **1**.\n\nThis removes the blur effect, giving you a crisp lock screen.\n\n## 3. Add “Take Ownership” to Right-Click Menu\n\nTaking ownership of files and folders can be tedious. You can add a quick option:\n\n- Navigate to: `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\*\\shell`\n- Create a new key named **runas**.\n- Set its **(Default)** value to: `Take Ownership`\n- Create a new string value named **HasLUAShield**.\n- Inside **runas**, create a new key **command** and set its **(Default)** value to: `cmd.exe /c takeown /f \"%1\" && icacls \"%1\" /grant administrators:F`\n\nNow you can right-click any file and instantly take ownership.\n\n## 4. Customize Taskbar Size\n\nWindows 11 doesn’t offer built-in taskbar resizing, but you can tweak it:\n\n- Go to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced`\n- Create a **DWORD (32-bit)** value named: `TaskbarSi`\n- Assign:\n- **0** = Small\n- **1** = Medium (default)\n- **2** = Large\n\nRestart **Windows Explorer** or reboot your system to see the change.\n\n## 5. Speed Up Context Menus\n\nIf right-click menus feel sluggish:\n\n- Navigate to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop`\n- Find the entry **MenuShowDelay**.\n- Change its value (default is 400 ms). Setting it to **200** makes menus feel snappier.\n\n## 6. Enable Detailed Startup and Shutdown Messages\n\nFor power users who want to see what’s happening during boot/shutdown:\n\n- Go to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System`\n- Create or modify a **DWORD (32-bit)** value named: `verbosestatus`\n- Set it to **1**.\n\nYour PC will now show detailed system messages during startup and shutdown.\n\nThese registry tweaks allow you to unlock hidden features and reclaim some control over your Windows 11 experience. Just remember to proceed carefully and document the changes you make. With the right tweaks, you can tailor Windows 11 to feel more responsive, functional, and personal.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/registry-tweaks-to-unlock-hidden-features-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/registry-tweaks-to-unlock-hidden-features-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/registry-tweaks-to-unlock-hidden-features-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/registry-tweaks-to-unlock-hidden-features-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/registry-tweaks-to-unlock-hidden-features-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2437)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Advanced File Explorer Tips for Faster Navigation in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11navigation.webp?fit=750%2C742&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/advanced-file-explorer-tips-for-faster-navigation-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Advanced Task Manager Tips for Power Users in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11Taskmanager.webp?fit=757%2C762&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/advanced-task-manager-tips-for-power-users-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Setting Up Windows Hello for Faster Logins in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wind11hello.webp?fit=690%2C701&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-windows-hello-for-faster-logins-in-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
