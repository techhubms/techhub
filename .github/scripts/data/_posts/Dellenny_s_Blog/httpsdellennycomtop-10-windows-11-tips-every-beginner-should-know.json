Whether you recently upgraded from Windows 10 or bought a new device with Windows 11 pre-installed, learning a few tips can help you get the most out of your PC.\n\nHere are **10 Windows 11 tips every beginner should know**:\n\n### 1. **Get Comfortable with the New Start Menu**\n\nThe Start Menu now sits in the center by default, with pinned apps at the top and recommended files below. If you prefer the classic left-aligned look, go to: **Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Taskbar &gt; Taskbar behaviors** and switch alignment to **Left**.\n\n### 2. **Master Virtual Desktops**\n\nWindows 11 makes it easier to create and manage multiple desktops. Hover over the **Task View icon** (two overlapping squares) on the taskbar to add a new desktop—for work, gaming, or personal tasks. You can customize each desktop with different wallpapers for better organization.\n\n### 3. **Use Snap Layouts for Better Multitasking**\n\nHover over the maximize button of any window to see Snap Layouts, which let you neatly organize apps side by side. Perfect for working on documents while keeping an eye on a chat or browser window.\n\n### 4. **Customize Widgets for Quick Glance Info**\n\nClick the **Widgets icon** on the taskbar to view news, weather, calendar events, and more. You can personalize what shows up so you only see the info that matters most.\n\n### 5. **Boost Productivity with Focus Sessions**\n\nThe new **Focus Sessions** feature in the Clock app helps you stay on task. It integrates with Spotify and Microsoft To Do, allowing you to set a timer, block distractions, and track productivity.\n\n### 6. **Use the New Clipboard History**\n\nPress **Windows + V** to open your clipboard history. Instead of just pasting the last thing you copied, you can pick from a history of copied text, images, and links.\n\n### 7. **Quickly Take Screenshots**\n\nWindows 11 makes screenshots easy. Press **Windows + Shift + S** to open the Snipping Tool, which lets you capture a full screen, window, or custom selection\n\n### 8. **Make the Most of Microsoft Store**\n\nThe redesigned Microsoft Store now includes more apps, including third-party ones like Zoom, Canva, and even Android apps (on supported PCs). Browse around—you may find tools that simplify your workflow.\n\n### 9. **Personalize Your PC’s Look**\n\nHead to **Settings &gt; Personalization** to change themes, wallpapers, colors, and dark/light modes. Windows 11’s design thrives on personalization, so tweak it to fit your style.\n\n### 10. **Try Voice Typing**\n\nPress **Windows + H** in any text field to start voice typing. It’s surprisingly accurate and even adds punctuation automatically, making it a handy tool for quick notes or hands-free typing.\n\nWindows 11 is packed with useful features designed to make your computing experience smoother and more enjoyable. By mastering these tips, you’ll save time, stay productive, and customize your PC to fit your needs.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2591)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Moving from Office 2016/2019 to Microsoft 365: What Changes?](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moving2019.webp?fit=724%2C701&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/)\n\n[![How to Reconfigure the Hidden Context Menu and Unlock Power Tweaks in Windows](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11contextmenu.webp?fit=709%2C703&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/)\n\n[![Unlocking Hidden Superpowers in Windows 11 Speech, Eye, and Voice Access Tools You Didn’t Know You Had](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-4.png?fit=713%2C614&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/unlocking-hidden-superpowers-in-windows-11-speech-eye-and-voice-access-tools-you-didnt-know-you-had/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
