While many people ignore it, widgets can actually serve as your **personal productivity dashboard**. Instead of opening multiple apps, you can check your tasks, schedule, and even the weather in one place. Here’s how to set it up.\n\n## Step 1: Open the Widgets Panel\n\n- On your taskbar, click the **Widgets button** (the icon that looks like a square divided into sections).\n- Or press **Win + W** on your keyboard for a quick shortcut.\n\nThis opens the Widgets panel on the left side of your screen.\n\n## Step 2: Add or Remove Widgets\n\n- At the top-right of the panel, click the **“+” (Add widgets)** button.\n- You’ll see a list of available widgets such as Calendar, To Do, Outlook Mail, Weather, Sports, and more.\n- Click **“+”** next to any widget you want to add.\n- To remove one, hover over it, click the **three dots (…)**, then choose **Remove widget**.\n\nTip: Focus only on widgets that help your productivity—leave out the ones that are distracting (like news or entertainment).\n\n## Step 3: Resize and Rearrange Widgets\n\n- Hover over a widget and click the **three dots (…)** menu.\n- Choose **Small, Medium, or Large** depending on how much detail you want.\n- Drag and drop widgets to rearrange them into an order that makes sense for your workflow.\n\n**Suggested Layout:**\n\n- **Top row:** Calendar + To Do (for daily priorities).\n- **Middle row:** Outlook Mail or Teams for quick communication.\n- **Bottom row:** Weather + Stocks (if relevant).\n\n## Step 4: Use Microsoft To Do for Task Management\n\nOne of the most powerful widgets for productivity is **Microsoft To Do**.\n\n- Add it as a widget to keep your priority tasks visible.\n- Create lists like “Work,” “Personal,” and “Today.”\n- The widget will always show your next steps without needing to open the full app.\n\n## Step 5: Integrate Outlook Calendar & Mail\n\nIf you use **Outlook**, add the **Calendar** and **Outlook Mail** widgets.\n\n- The Calendar widget shows your upcoming meetings and reminders.\n- The Mail widget previews important emails so you can stay on top without constant inbox-checking.\n\n## Step 6: Customize with Interests (Optional)\n\nIf you want your dashboard to also include useful updates:\n\n- Click your profile picture in the top-right corner of the Widgets panel.\n- Select **Manage your news and interests**.\n- From there, you can personalize what shows up—finance, technology, or health instead of random trending topics.\n\n## Step 7: Pin the Dashboard for Quick Access\n\nThe Widgets panel isn’t permanently visible, but you can:\n\n- **Pin it to the taskbar** so it’s always one click away.\n- Or get into the habit of using **Win + W** to pull it up quickly.\n\n## Pro Tips for a Smarter Dashboard\n\n- **Declutter:** Too many widgets = chaos. Stick to 4–6 essentials.\n- **Think Work + Life:** Mix professional widgets (To Do, Calendar, Mail) with personal ones (Weather, Fitness, Traffic).\n- **Experiment Weekly:** Try different layouts until it feels natural.\n\nWith a little customization, the Windows 11 Widgets panel can become much more than a news feed—it can be your **personal productivity dashboard**. By surfacing tasks, calendars, emails, and essentials in one glance, you’ll spend less time switching apps and more time getting things done.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/turning-widgets-into-a-personal-productivity-dashboard-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/turning-widgets-into-a-personal-productivity-dashboard-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/turning-widgets-into-a-personal-productivity-dashboard-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/turning-widgets-into-a-personal-productivity-dashboard-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/turning-widgets-into-a-personal-productivity-dashboard-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2298)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Mastering Windows 11 Keyboard Shortcuts You Didn’t Know Existed](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-2.png?fit=578%2C527&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/mastering-windows-11-keyboard-shortcuts-you-didnt-know-existed/)\n\n[![Windows 11 Setting Up Virtual Desktops for Better Multitasking](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-1.png?fit=703%2C553&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-setting-up-virtual-desktops-for-better-multitasking/)\n\n[![Mastering Snap Layouts and Snap Groups in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-4.png?fit=713%2C614&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/mastering-snap-layouts-and-snap-groups-in-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
