Microsoftâ€™s **Windows Hello** offers a faster, safer, and more personal way to sign in to your Windows device â€” using **facial recognition**, **fingerprint scanning**, or **PIN authentication**.\n\nWhether youâ€™re using a laptop with a built-in camera, a desktop with a fingerprint reader, or a Surface device, setting up Windows Hello is easy.

Under **Ways to sign in**, select **Face recognition (Windows Hello)**.\n3. Click **Set up**, then choose **Get started**.\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to look directly into your camera.\n5. When prompted, create a **PIN** as a backup login method.\n\n**Pro Tip:** You can improve accuracy by clicking **Improve recognition** to scan your face again in different lighting conditions.\n\n## How to Set Up Windows Hello Fingerprint\n\nIf your device has a built-in or external fingerprint reader:\n\n1. Go to **Settings â†’ Accounts â†’ Sign-in options**.\n2. Select **Fingerprint recognition (Windows Hello)**.\n3. Click **Set up**, then select **Get started**.\n4. Scan your finger on the sensor several times until the setup completes.\n5. Add a **PIN** for backup if you havenâ€™t already.\n\nYou can also add multiple fingerprints (for example, both index fingers) for convenience.\n\n## Managing or Removing Windows Hello\n\nIf you ever want to remove or change your biometric data:\n\n1. Go to **Settings â†’ Accounts â†’ Sign-in options**.\n2. Select the sign-in option you want to manage.\n3. Choose **Remove** or **Improve recognition**.\n\n## Why Use Windows Hello?\n\nHereâ€™s why Windows Hello is worth enabling:\n\n- ðŸ”’ **Better Security:** Biometric data stays on your device â€” itâ€™s never sent to the cloud.\n- âš¡ **Speed:** Instant sign-ins without typing long passwords.\n- ðŸ§  **Smarter Login:** Works seamlessly across supported apps and browsers.\n\n## Troubleshooting Tips\n\nIf setup fails or isnâ€™t available:\n\n- Ensure Windows is updated.\n- Check that your device drivers (camera or fingerprint reader) are up to date.\n- Try restarting your PC and repeating the setup.\n\nWindows Hello is one of the simplest ways to enhance both your security and convenience.
