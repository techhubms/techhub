Most people only scratch the surface of what it can do, but with the right tricks, you can automate repetitive tasks, speed up communication, and reclaim hours every week.\n\nHere are **10 Microsoft 365 hacks** that can help you save *at least* an hour a day.\n\n## 1. Use Quick Steps in Outlook\n\nIf you find yourself performing the same email actions repeatedly (move to folder, reply, forward, etc.), Quick Steps can do it in one click. For example, you can set up a Quick Step that automatically forwards an email to your manager, marks it as read, and files it away.\n\n**Where to find it:** Outlook ‚Üí Home ‚Üí Quick Steps.\n\n## 2. Schedule Emails in Outlook\n\nInstead of clogging up someone‚Äôs inbox late at night, schedule your emails to send at the perfect time. This is especially useful for working across time zones.\n\n**How:** In Outlook, compose your email ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Delay Delivery ‚Üí Set time.\n\n## 3. Use @Mentions in Emails & Teams\n\nTired of long threads where nobody knows who should act? Just type `@Name` in Outlook or Teams, and it‚Äôll tag that person, highlight their name, and even add them to the ‚ÄúTo‚Äù field automatically.\n\n## 4. Speed Up Documents with Templates in Word & PowerPoint\n\nStop reinventing the wheel. Save frequently used proposals, reports, or presentations as templates so you can start with a polished base every time.\n\n**How:** File ‚Üí Save As ‚Üí Word Template or PowerPoint Template.\n\n## 5. Master OneNote for Meeting Notes\n\nOneNote integrates with Outlook and Teams so you can capture meeting notes that link directly to calendar invites. You can even tag action items and assign them instantly.\n\n## 6. Automate Repetitive Tasks with Power Automate\n\nThink of Power Automate as your personal assistant. You can create workflows like:\n\n- Saving email attachments directly to OneDrive.\n- Notifying Teams when a new SharePoint file is uploaded.\n- Sending reminders before deadlines.\n\n## 7. Use Dictation Instead of Typing\n\nWhether you‚Äôre in Word, Outlook, or PowerPoint, you can dictate your thoughts instead of typing them out. It‚Äôs surprisingly accurate and much faster for drafting emails or notes.\n\n**Where:** Home ‚Üí Dictate.\n\n## 8. Turn Excel Data into Insights Instantly\n\nInstead of spending hours on formulas, let Excel do the heavy lifting. Use the ‚ÄúAnalyze Data‚Äù button (formerly ‚ÄúIdeas‚Äù) to generate pivot tables, charts, and summaries instantly.\n\n## 9. Use Teams Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nNavigating Teams with your mouse is slow. Use shortcuts like:\n\n- `Ctrl + E`\n‚Üí Jump to the search bar.\n- `Ctrl + Shift + M`\n‚Üí Mute/unmute.\n- `Ctrl + 1`\n‚Üí Switch to Activity tab.\n\nThese little shortcuts add up to big time savings.\n\n## 10. Collaborate in Real-Time with Share Links\n\nInstead of emailing attachments back and forth, share your Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files via OneDrive or SharePoint. Everyone edits the same document, and you never waste time merging versions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 is designed to make work easier, but only if you know how to unlock its features. By using these 10 hacks, you can streamline your workflow, reduce busywork, and free up at least an hour a day to focus on what really matters.\n\nüëâ Start by picking just *two hacks* from this list and making them part of your daily routine. You‚Äôll feel the difference instantly.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-365-hacks-that-will-instantly-save-you-an-hour-a-day/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-365-hacks-that-will-instantly-save-you-an-hour-a-day/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-365-hacks-that-will-instantly-save-you-an-hour-a-day/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-365-hacks-that-will-instantly-save-you-an-hour-a-day/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/10-microsoft-365-hacks-that-will-instantly-save-you-an-hour-a-day/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2690)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Microsoft Teams vs Slack in 2025 Which Wins for Remote Work?](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/teamsvsSlack.webp?fit=723%2C710&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-teams-vs-slack-in-2025-which-wins-for-remote-work/)\n\n[![The Small Business Guide to Managing Customers with Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365smallbusiness.webp?fit=711%2C721&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/the-small-business-guide-to-managing-customers-with-microsoft-365/)\n\n[![Deep Dive into Microsoft Lists Advanced Formatting and Automation](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lists.webp?fit=710%2C717&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/deep-dive-into-microsoft-lists-advanced-formatting-and-automation/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d"
