Luckily, Windows 11 comes with powerful built-in toolsâ€”**Storage Sense** and **Disk Cleanup**â€”to help you reclaim space and keep your system running smoothly.\n\n## What is Storage Sense in Windows 11?\n\nStorage Sense is an **automated storage manager** that clears temporary files, empties your Recycle Bin, and removes old system files without you lifting a finger. Once enabled, it runs in the background and keeps your PC clutter-free.\n\n### How to Turn On and Configure Storage Sense:\n\n1. **Open Settings** â†’ Go to **System** â†’ **Storage**.\n2. Find **Storage Sense** and toggle it **On**.\n3. Click on **Storage Sense settings**to customize:\n- **Run Storage Sense automatically**: Choose frequency (Every day, Week, Month, or When disk space is low).\n- **Temporary files**: Automatically delete app temp files.\n- **Recycle Bin cleanup**: Set files to auto-delete after 1, 14, 30, or 60 days.\n- **Downloads folder cleanup**: Decide if Windows should clear unused files here.\n\nðŸ’¡ **Pro tip:** If you use **OneDrive**, Storage Sense can make files available online-only when you havenâ€™t opened them for a while, saving local disk space.\n\n## Using Disk Cleanup in Windows 11\n\nWhile Storage Sense is the modern solution, Windows 11 still includes the **classic Disk Cleanup tool** for manual cleanups. Itâ€™s great for removing large system files like Windows Update leftovers.\n\n### Steps to Run Disk Cleanup:\n\n1. Press **Windows key + S**, type **Disk Cleanup**, and open the app.\n2. Select the drive you want to clean (usually **C:**).\n3. Check the boxes for items you want to remove, such as:\n- Temporary Internet Files\n- System error memory dump files\n- Windows Update Cleanup\n- Recycle Bin contents\n4. Click **OK** â†’ **Delete Files**.\n\nFor deeper cleaning:\n\n- Click **Clean up system files** in Disk Cleanup.\n- This option lets you remove old Windows installation files and update caches that can take up several gigabytes.\n\n## Extra Windows 11 Storage Tips\n\n- **Check storage usage:** In **Settings â†’ Storage**, view which categories (apps, photos, temporary files) take up the most space.\n- **Uninstall unused apps:** Go to **Settings â†’ Apps â†’ Installed Apps** and remove programs you no longer use.\n- **Enable OneDrive Files On-Demand:** Keep files online-only until you need them.\n- **Move files to external storage:** Large videos, photos, and archives are best stored on an external drive or cloud storage.\n- **Empty Recycle Bin regularly:** Remember, files only free up space once the bin is emptied.\n\nWindows 11 makes storage management simple. **Storage Sense** keeps your system clean automatically, while **Disk Cleanup** offers a deeper manual cleanup when you need it. By combining both, plus a few good storage habits, you can enjoy a faster, clutter-free PC with plenty of space for what really matters.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/storage-sense-and-disk-cleanup-tips-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/storage-sense-and-disk-cleanup-tips-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/storage-sense-and-disk-cleanup-tips-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/storage-sense-and-disk-cleanup-tips-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/storage-sense-and-disk-cleanup-tips-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2559)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Customizing Shell UI Elements Beyond the Basics Task View &amp; Experimental WinUI Styling](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11UI.webp?fit=772%2C766&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/customizing-shell-ui-elements-beyond-the-basics-task-view-experimental-winui-styling/)\n\n[![Windows 11: Whatâ€™s New Compared to Windows 10](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11new.webp?fit=725%2C697&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-whats-new-compared-to-windows-10/)\n\n[![Intel HAXM vs. Hyper-V/WHPX Choosing the Right Setup for Android Emulator on Windows](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/intelhyperv.webp?fit=724%2C718&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/intel-haxm-vs-hyper-v-whpx-choosing-the-right-setup-for-android-emulator-on-windows/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
