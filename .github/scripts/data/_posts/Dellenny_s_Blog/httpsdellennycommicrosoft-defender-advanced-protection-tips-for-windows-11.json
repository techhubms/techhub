While it works well out of the box, enabling a few advanced settings can significantly strengthen your defenses against ransomware, phishing, and sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nHere are some **practical tips** to get the most out of Microsoft Defender on Windows 11:\n\n## 1. Keep Microsoft Defender Updated\n\n- Defender receives **regular security intelligence updates** from Microsoft.\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Windows Update &gt; Advanced options** and make sure **Receive updates for other Microsoft products** is turned on.\n- Run a **Quick Scan** after major updates to ensure nothing slipped through.\n\n## 2. Turn On Controlled Folder Access\n\nRansomware attacks often encrypt files and demand payment. Controlled Folder Access blocks unauthorized apps from modifying your files.\n\n- Navigate to **Windows Security &gt; Virus & threat protection &gt; Ransomware protection**.\n- Enable **Controlled folder access**.\n- Add your important folders (Documents, Pictures, OneDrive) to the protected list.\n\n## 3. Use Tamper Protection\n\nHackers may try to disable your antivirus before attacking. **Tamper Protection** prevents malicious apps from altering Defender’s settings.\n\n- Go to **Windows Security &gt; Virus & threat protection settings**.\n- Switch on **Tamper Protection**.\n\n## 4. Enable Exploit Protection\n\nThis feature reduces the risk of malware exploiting vulnerabilities in apps.\n\n- Open **Windows Security &gt; App & browser control &gt; Exploit protection settings**.\n- Leave system-wide settings on defaults for best balance, but consider turning on **Force randomization (ASLR)** and **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)** for extra safety.\n\n## 5. Use SmartScreen for Safer Browsing\n\nWindows Defender SmartScreen helps block phishing sites and unsafe downloads.\n\n- Go to **Windows Security &gt; App & browser control**.\n- Enable **Check apps and files** and **SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge**.\n- Turn on **Potentially unwanted app blocking** to stop bloatware and adware.\n\n## 6. Enable Network Protection\n\nNetwork Protection blocks connections to dangerous websites even outside your browser.\n\n- Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: `Set-MpPreference -EnableNetworkProtection Enabled`\n- This helps block phishing domains across all apps, not just browsers.\n\n## 7. Run Microsoft Defender Offline Scan\n\nSome malware hides deep in the system and can’t be removed while Windows is running.\n\n- Go to **Windows Security &gt; Virus & threat protection &gt; Scan options**.\n- Select **Microsoft Defender Offline scan**.\n- Your PC will restart and scan before Windows boots.\n\n## 8. Use Windows Security Notifications Wisely\n\nDefender can notify you about potential threats or settings that need attention.\n\n- Go to **Windows Security &gt; Manage notifications**.\n- Keep **Virus & threat protection notifications** enabled.\n- Disable unnecessary ones if you want fewer interruptions, but keep security-critical alerts on.\n\n## 9. Complement with BitLocker & Backup\n\nMicrosoft Defender is strong, but pairing it with **BitLocker drive encryption** and a reliable **backup strategy (File History, OneDrive, or external drives)** ensures that even if malware strikes, your data remains safe.\n\n## 10. Regularly Review Security Health\n\n- Open **Windows Security &gt; Device performance & health**.\n- Check for recommendations on storage, battery, and device integrity.\n- Resolve issues early to avoid performance or vulnerability problems.\n\nMicrosoft Defender in Windows 11 is more powerful than ever—when properly configured. By turning on these advanced features, you can transform your PC into a **hardened security environment** without needing third-party tools.\n\nCyber threats evolve daily, but with a proactive setup and safe online habits, Defender can keep you well-protected.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-defender-advanced-protection-tips-for-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-defender-advanced-protection-tips-for-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-defender-advanced-protection-tips-for-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-defender-advanced-protection-tips-for-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-defender-advanced-protection-tips-for-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2349)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Set Up Hyper-V Virtual Machines in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/hyperv.webp?fit=745%2C741&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Syncing Your Android Phone with Windows 11 Using Phone Link](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11andorid.webp?fit=767%2C751&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/syncing-your-android-phone-with-windows-11-using-phone-link/)\n\n[![How to Join and Use the Windows Insider Program](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wininsider.webp?fit=746%2C777&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-join-and-use-the-windows-insider-program/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
