This built-in agent is designed to support Scrum teams by automating and enhancing common workflows — freeing up time to focus on what matters: delivering value.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll walk you through:\n\n- ✅ What the Scrum Assistant agent is\n- ⚙️ How to activate it\n- 🛠️ How to use it effectively\n- 💡 Tips to maximize your Agile productivity\n\n## 🤖 What Is the Scrum Assistant Agent?\n\nThe **Scrum Assistant agent** is a purpose-built AI inside GitHub Copilot that helps Scrum teams stay on track. Think of it as a virtual Scrum Master: it assists with task updates, tracking blockers, sprint retrospectives, and can even help summarize team progress for reporting.\n\nIt can help you:\n\n- Draft user stories and acceptance criteria\n- Track and summarize standups\n- Flag blockers or impediments\n- Assist with backlog grooming\n- Prepare retro summaries\n- Recommend sprint goals\n\nAll inside GitHub Copilot Chat or Copilot Workspace (depending on your setup).\n\n## ⚙️ How to Activate the Scrum Assistant Agent\n\nAs of now, GitHub Copilot supports AI agents (like the Scrum Assistant) in Copilot Chat or Copilot Workspace. Here’s how you can activate it:\n\n### 🧪 Step 1: Join the Copilot Workspace Beta (if required)\n\nSome features, like agents, are rolling out progressively. If you don’t see the Scrum Assistant option:\n\n- Go to [https://github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)\n- Request access to **Copilot Workspace** or enable the **Preview features** in your GitHub account settings.\n\n### 🧠 Step 2: Enable Agents in Copilot Chat\n\n1. Open **Copilot Chat** in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, or via GitHub.com.\n2. Click on the **agents menu** or prompt bar.\n3. Select **Scrum Assistant** from the available agents list.\n4. Optionally, provide context like your project, sprint cadence, or backlog details.\n\nYou’re now ready to interact with the Scrum Assistant.\n\n## 🛠️ How to Use the Scrum Assistant\n\nHere are some example prompts and how the Scrum Assistant can help:\n\n### 🕘 1. **Daily Standup Updates**\n\n``` bashCopyEdit@ScrumAssistant update my standup: I worked on the login feature yesterday, today I'm fixing OAuth bugs, and I'm blocked by missing test credentials.\n\n```\n\n✅ Result: Copilot logs your update and summarizes blockers for the team.\n\n### 📋 2. **Drafting User Stories**\n\n``` bashCopyEdit@ScrumAssistant write a user story for adding password reset to the mobile app.\n\n```\n\n✅ Result: You’ll get a formatted user story with acceptance criteria.\n\n### 🔍 3. **Backlog Grooming**\n\n``` bashCopyEdit@ScrumAssistant review these tasks and suggest priorities.\n\n```\n\n✅ Result: It will analyze task descriptions, dependencies, and suggest grooming actions.\n\n### 📊 4. **Sprint Retros**\n\n``` bashCopyEdit@ScrumAssistant summarize team feedback from the last sprint and highlight areas to improve.\n\n```\n\n✅ Result: A clean, actionable summary for your next retro.\n\n## 💡 Pro Tips\n\n- **Give it context**: Mention your team’s name, sprint goal, or Jira board for better results.\n- **Use markdown**: Copilot handles structured data well; use `- [ ]`\ntask lists, `##` headers, etc.\n- **Integrate with chat tools**: Some integrations allow Scrum Assistant to post updates to Slack or Teams.\n- **Follow up**: Ask things like *“Expand this user story”* or *“Generate follow-up tasks”*.\n\nThe Scrum Assistant agent in Copilot isn’t just a novelty — it’s a serious productivity booster for Agile teams. By embedding an AI-powered Scrum Master in your daily workflow, you reduce the friction of meetings, improve clarity, and accelerate planning.\n\nWhether you’re a solo developer wearing many hats or part of a larger dev team, this agent helps you work smarter — not harder.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-activate-and-use-the-scrum-assistant-agent-in-github-copilot/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-activate-and-use-the-scrum-assistant-agent-in-github-copilot/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-activate-and-use-the-scrum-assistant-agent-in-github-copilot/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-activate-and-use-the-scrum-assistant-agent-in-github-copilot/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-activate-and-use-the-scrum-assistant-agent-in-github-copilot/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2127)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![GPT‑5 Finally Arrives in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copiltoGPT.webp?fit=655%2C667&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/gpt%e2%80%915-finally-arrives-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n[![What Is Microsoft Copilot Studio?
