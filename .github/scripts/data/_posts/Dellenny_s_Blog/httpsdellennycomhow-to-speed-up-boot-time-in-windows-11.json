Windows 11 is generally faster than its predecessors, but unnecessary startup apps, outdated drivers, or misconfigured settings can slow things down. Luckily, there are several ways to make your system start up more quickly. Here’s a step-by-step guide to speeding up boot time in Windows 11.\n\n## 1. Enable Fast Startup\n\nWindows includes a built-in feature called **Fast Startup**, which combines elements of hibernation and shutdown to launch your PC faster.\n\n- Press **Windows + S**, type *Control Panel*, and open it.\n- Go to **Hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options &gt; Choose what the power buttons do**.\n- Click **Change settings that are currently unavailable**.\n- Under *Shutdown settings*, check **Turn on fast startup (recommended)**.\n- Save changes.\n\n⚡ Note: If you use dual boot or certain encryption tools, you may prefer to leave this off.\n\n## 2. Disable Unnecessary Startup Apps\n\nToo many programs launching at startup can drag down boot time.\n\n- Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open **Task Manager**.\n- Go to the **Startup apps** tab.\n- Right-click on apps you don’t need at boot and choose **Disable**.\n\nFocus on apps like game launchers, messengers, or update managers you rarely use.\n\n## 3. Keep Windows and Drivers Updated\n\nOutdated system files and drivers can slow performance.\n\n- Open **Settings &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates**.\n- For drivers, go to **Device Manager**, right-click on hardware, and select **Update driver**.\n- Alternatively, download drivers from your manufacturer’s website.\n\n## 4. Optimize Background Services\n\nSome services run automatically and consume resources.\n\n- Press **Windows + R**, type `msconfig`\n, and hit Enter.\n- Go to the **Services** tab, check **Hide all Microsoft services**, then review the remaining list.\n- Disable services you don’t need (e.g., third-party update services).\n\n⚠️ Be cautious—disabling critical services can cause problems.\n\n## 5. Defragment or Optimize Your Drive\n\nIf you use a traditional HDD, fragmented files slow down booting. SSDs don’t need defragmentation but benefit from optimization.\n\n- Open **Start**, type *Defragment and Optimize Drives*.\n- Select your drive and click **Optimize**.\n\n## 6. Switch to an SSD\n\nIf you’re still on an HDD, upgrading to a **Solid State Drive (SSD)** can dramatically improve boot time. Windows 11 is optimized for SSDs, and the difference is night and day.\n\n## 7. Adjust BIOS/UEFI Settings\n\nSometimes the boot sequence in your BIOS/UEFI causes delays.\n\n- Restart your PC and enter BIOS/UEFI (commonly by pressing **F2**, **Del**, or **Esc** during startup).\n- Look for **Fast Boot** or similar options and enable them.\n- Ensure your primary drive is set as the first boot device.\n\n## 8. Reduce Visual Effects (Optional)\n\nWindows 11 has sleek animations, but they can slightly slow performance.\n\n- Open **Settings &gt; System &gt; Advanced system settings**.\n- Under *Performance*, click **Settings**.\n- Select **Adjust for best performance**, or manually uncheck animations you don’t need.\n\nBy enabling fast startup, trimming startup apps, keeping drivers up-to-date, and optimizing your hardware, you can shave valuable seconds off your Windows 11 boot time. For the biggest speed boost, nothing beats upgrading to an SSD.\n\nWith these tweaks, you’ll spend less time staring at the loading screen—and more time getting things done.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-speed-up-boot-time-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-speed-up-boot-time-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-speed-up-boot-time-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-speed-up-boot-time-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-speed-up-boot-time-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2310)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Mastering Windows 11 Keyboard Shortcuts You Didn’t Know Existed](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-2.png?fit=578%2C527&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/mastering-windows-11-keyboard-shortcuts-you-didnt-know-existed/)\n\n[![Turning Widgets into a Personal Productivity Dashboard in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-3.png?fit=722%2C706&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/turning-widgets-into-a-personal-productivity-dashboard-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Windows 11 Setting Up Virtual Desktops for Better Multitasking](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-1.png?fit=703%2C553&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-setting-up-virtual-desktops-for-better-multitasking/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
