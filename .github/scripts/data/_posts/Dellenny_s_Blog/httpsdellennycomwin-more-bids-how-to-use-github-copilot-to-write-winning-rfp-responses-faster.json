You’re juggling technical writing, project planning, team bios, timelines, and budget estimates—all while racing to hit a submission deadline.\n\nBut what if your team had an **AI assistant that could write drafts, suggest improvements, and help you format the entire response**—in minutes?\n\nThat’s where **GitHub Copilot** comes in.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to use Copilot to supercharge your RFP responses and increase your chances of winning project bids—step by step.\n\n## 🧠 Step 1: Understand the RFP Requirements\n\nBefore opening your editor, read the RFP carefully and extract key points:\n\n- Deliverables\n- Tech requirements\n- Evaluation criteria\n- Submission deadlines\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try in Copilot Chat:**\n\n``` Summarize this RFP into key objectives, deliverables, and constraints. ```\n\n💡 Paste the RFP text into a markdown or code comment block, and Copilot can help you condense it.\n\n## 🧱 Step 2: Create a Proposal Template\n\nStart with a standard response structure in a `.md` file.\n\n```\n# Proposal for [Project Name]## 1. Executive Summary## 2. Company Background## 3. Understanding of Requirements## 4. Technical Approach## 5. Project Plan & Timeline## 6. Team & Roles## 7. Budget Estimate## 8. Assumptions & Dependencies## 9. Contact Information\n```\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` Generate a professional RFP response template in markdown format. ```\n\nCopilot will generate or expand your template as you type.\n\n## ✍️ Step 3: Write a Strong Executive Summary\n\nKick off your proposal with a concise, persuasive summary.\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` Write an executive summary for a web application development proposal using React, Node.js, and AWS. ```\n\nCopilot might suggest:\n\n“Our team proposes the development of a scalable, secure, and user-friendly web application leveraging modern technologies including React, Node.js, and AWS Cloud infrastructure…”\n\n## 🔧 Step 4: Describe Your Technical Approach\n\nThis is where you demonstrate your understanding of the project and how you’ll deliver it.\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` Describe a technical approach for building a cloud-native microservices app with Kubernetes and MongoDB. ```\n\nCopilot could write about architecture, scalability, and deployment practices.\n\nYou can also prompt it inline:\n\n```\n## Technical ApproachWe recommend...\n```\n\nAnd Copilot will auto-complete with best practices based on your stack.\n\n## 📆 Step 5: Build a Project Timeline\n\nUse Copilot to create a phase-by-phase plan.\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` Create a 12-week project timeline for a software development lifecycle using Agile. ```\n\nExample Copilot output:\n\n``` | Phase | Duration | Activities ||------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|| Discovery | 2 weeks | Stakeholder interviews, requirements || Design & Prototyping | 2 weeks | Wireframes, UI/UX design || Development Sprint 1 | 2 weeks | Core features || Development Sprint 2 | 2 weeks | Remaining features, backend integration || QA & Testing | 2 weeks | Manual and automated tests || Deployment & Handoff | 2 weeks | Final release, training, documentation | ```\n\n## 👥 Step 6: Introduce Your Team\n\nList your team and their relevant experience. Copilot can auto-fill bios.\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` Write a short team member bio for a full-stack developer with 10 years of experience in .NET and Azure. ```\n\nExample:\n\n“John Smith is a Senior Full-Stack Developer with a decade of experience delivering enterprise-grade solutions using .NET Core, C#, and Azure cloud services…”\n\n## 💰 Step 7: Create Budget Estimates\n\nCopilot can help format professional-looking budget tables quickly.\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` Create a sample software project budget with roles, hours, rates, and total cost. ```\n\n``` | Role | Hours | Rate | Total ||-------------------|-------|--------|----------|| Project Manager | 40 | $100/h | $4,000 || Developer (2) | 400 | $120/h | $48,000 || QA Engineer | 80 | $90/h | $7,200 || Total | | | $59,200 | ```\n\n## 🧾 Step 8: Add Assumptions and Dependencies\n\nThis often-overlooked section shows foresight.\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` List key assumptions and external dependencies for a SaaS product development project. ```\n\nExample Copilot response:\n\n```\n- Client will provide access to existing systems and APIs- Third-party authentication provider will be selected and integrated- Project timelines assume full-time availability of the client’s product owner\n```\n\n## ✅ Step 9: Review, Polish, and Customize\n\nCopilot gets you 80% there—but the final 20% is yours:\n\n- Add client-specific language\n- Customize tone to match your brand\n- Run a grammar/style checker (like Grammarly)\n\n🔹 **Prompt to try:**\n\n``` Improve the clarity and tone of this section for a formal client proposal. ```\n\nPaste any paragraph, and Copilot will rewrite it to sound more polished.\n\n## 🧠 Bonus: Ask Copilot Questions with Chat\n\nIf you have **GitHub Copilot Chat**, you can ask contextual questions like:\n\n- “How do I explain the benefits of CI/CD pipelines to a non-technical client?”\n- “Suggest risk mitigation strategies for cloud migration projects.”\n- “What KPIs should I include in a proposal for an analytics dashboard?”\n\nCopilot will provide well-structured answers you can drop straight into your proposal.\n\nMore about Copilot\n\n> [How to Use Microsoft Copilot to Supercharge Your Internet Business](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-microsoft-copilot-to-supercharge-your-internet-business/)\n\n> [How to Use Microsoft Copilot to Analyze Investments](https://dellenny.com/how-to-use-microsoft-copilot-to-analyze-investments/)\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/win-more-bids-how-to-use-github-copilot-to-write-winning-rfp-responses-faster/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/win-more-bids-how-to-use-github-copilot-to-write-winning-rfp-responses-faster/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/win-more-bids-how-to-use-github-copilot-to-write-winning-rfp-responses-faster/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/win-more-bids-how-to-use-github-copilot-to-write-winning-rfp-responses-faster/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/win-more-bids-how-to-use-github-copilot-to-write-winning-rfp-responses-faster/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2107)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![GPT‑5 Finally Arrives in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copiltoGPT.webp?fit=655%2C667&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/gpt%e2%80%915-finally-arrives-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n[![What Is Microsoft Copilot Studio?
