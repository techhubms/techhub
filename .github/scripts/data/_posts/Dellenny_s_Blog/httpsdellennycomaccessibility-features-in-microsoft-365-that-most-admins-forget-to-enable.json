However, many of these features remain overlooked or underutilized by IT administrators. Ensuring accessibility isn’t just about compliance—it’s about empowering every user to contribute fully. Here are some accessibility features in Microsoft 365 that admins often forget to enable (or configure correctly), along with steps on how to turn them on.\n\n## 1. Accessibility Checker in Office Apps\n\nMost admins don’t realize they can enforce the **Accessibility Checker** in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. By default, it’s available, but enabling policies to prompt users to run checks before sharing documents can help catch inaccessible formatting, missing alt text, and color contrast issues.\n\n**How to Enable:**\n\n1. In any Office app (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), go to **Review &gt; Check Accessibility**.\n2. To encourage organization-wide usage, configure **Microsoft Purview compliance policies** so documents are automatically checked before sharing.\n\n## 2. Immersive Reader Across Apps\n\nImmersive Reader isn’t just for students. It’s available across Outlook, Teams, Word, and OneNote, helping users with dyslexia, ADHD, or visual stress. It can read text aloud, adjust spacing, and change background colors.\n\n**How to Enable:**\n\n1. In Teams, hover over a chat message or post.\n2. Select the **More Options (…) &gt; Immersive Reader**.\n3. Admins can confirm this feature is enabled under **Teams Admin Center &gt; Messaging Policies &gt; Immersive Reader**.\n\n## 3. Live Captions and Transcriptions in Teams\n\nTeams meetings now support **real-time captions and live transcription**. However, many admins leave this feature disabled by default.\n\n**How to Enable:**\n\n1. Go to **Teams Admin Center**.\n2. Navigate to **Meetings &gt; Meeting policies**.\n3. Under **Audio & video**, switch **Allow transcription** and **Allow captions** to **On**.\n4. Apply policies to the appropriate users/groups.\n\n## 4. Accessibility Mode in SharePoint\n\nSharePoint pages and document libraries have **Accessibility Mode**, improving navigation for screen reader users.\n\n**How to Enable:**\n\n1. In SharePoint, go to **Settings &gt; Site Settings**.\n2. Under **Site Collection Administration**, select **Accessibility Mode**.\n3. Encourage site owners to use built-in **accessible templates** and run accessibility checks using the **Microsoft Accessibility Insights tool**.\n\n## 5. Dictation and Speech-to-Text Tools\n\nDictation is available across Microsoft 365 apps, but admins often overlook permissions and licensing.\n\n**How to Enable:**\n\n1. Ensure users are licensed with **Microsoft 365 E3/E5 or Office 365 subscriptions that include dictation**.\n2. Go to **Microsoft 365 Admin Center &gt; Settings &gt; Org settings &gt; Services &gt; Microsoft Speech Services**.\n3. Enable dictation for your tenant.\n\n## 6. Screen Reader Optimization in Outlook\n\nOutlook has **screen reader optimization** settings that improve usability with assistive technology.\n\n**How to Enable:**\n\n1. In Outlook desktop, go to **File &gt; Options &gt; Ease of Access**.\n2. Select **Optimize for screen reader**.\n3. Admins can also configure this using **Group Policy** or **Intune device configuration profiles** for consistency.\n\n## 7. High Contrast and Dark Mode Policies\n\nMicrosoft 365 apps support high contrast themes and dark mode, but admins don’t always make these easily accessible.\n\n**How to Enable:**\n\n1. In **Windows Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors**, users can select **High Contrast** themes.\n2. In Office apps, go to **File &gt; Account &gt; Office Theme** to enable **Dark Mode**.\n3. Admins should ensure policies in **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** don’t block theme changes.\n\nAccessibility in Microsoft 365 isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a productivity and inclusivity multiplier. As an admin, you can make a real impact by enabling and promoting these features. Regularly audit accessibility configurations, update user training, and remind teams that accessibility benefits everyone—not just those with identified needs.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/accessibility-features-in-microsoft-365-that-most-admins-forget-to-enable/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/accessibility-features-in-microsoft-365-that-most-admins-forget-to-enable/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/accessibility-features-in-microsoft-365-that-most-admins-forget-to-enable/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/accessibility-features-in-microsoft-365-that-most-admins-forget-to-enable/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/accessibility-features-in-microsoft-365-that-most-admins-forget-to-enable/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2472)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Lesser-Known Microsoft 365 Features That Save Hours (Beyond Teams and Outlook)](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365-1.webp?fit=755%2C689&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/lesser-known-microsoft-365-features-that-save-hours-beyond-teams-and-outlook/)\n\n[![How Nonprofits Can Maximize Microsoft 365 Donations](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365nonprofit.webp?fit=749%2C747&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-nonprofits-can-maximize-microsoft-365-donations/)\n\n[![Microsoft 365 for Education Best Practices for Teachers](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365teachers.webp?fit=768%2C782&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-for-education-best-practices-for-teachers/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
