Whether you use your PC for work, gaming, or personal browsing, it’s essential to strengthen its defenses against malware, phishing, and unauthorized access.\n\nBelow are practical steps you can take to improve security on your Windows 11 PC.\n\n## 1. Keep Windows Updated\n\nMicrosoft regularly releases security patches and feature updates to protect against new vulnerabilities.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Windows Update**.\n- Enable **Automatic Updates** to ensure you never miss critical fixes.\n- Restart your device promptly after updates are installed.\n\n## 2. Enable Windows Security Features\n\nWindows 11 comes with built-in protection tools:\n\n- **Windows Security (Defender):** Offers real-time virus and threat protection.\n- **Firewall & Network Protection:** Blocks unauthorized connections.\n- **Ransomware Protection:** Add folders to “Controlled Folder Access” to prevent malicious encryption.\n\nOpen **Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy & security &gt; Windows Security** to configure these.\n\n## 3. Use Strong Authentication\n\n- **Set a Strong Password or Passphrase.** Avoid common words or short strings.\n- **Enable Windows Hello.** Use facial recognition, fingerprint, or a PIN for faster, safer logins.\n- **Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).** Pair your Microsoft account with an authenticator app for extra protection.\n\n## 4. Encrypt Your Data with BitLocker\n\nIf your PC is lost or stolen, BitLocker encryption ensures your data remains safe.\n\n- Available on **Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise editions**.\n- To enable: Search for **BitLocker** in the Start menu, then turn it on for your drives.\n\n## 5. Secure Your Network\n\n- Change your **Wi-Fi router’s default credentials** and use **WPA3 encryption** if available.\n- Consider a **VPN** when using public Wi-Fi to protect your data from snooping.\n- Disable file and printer sharing when connected to unfamiliar networks.\n\n## 6. Control App Permissions\n\nApps often request more access than necessary.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Privacy & security &gt; App permissions**.\n- Review permissions for location, microphone, camera, and background apps.\n- Disable any that seem unnecessary.\n\n## 7. Backup Regularly\n\nEven with the best defenses, things can go wrong. Regular backups ensure you don’t lose important files.\n\n- Use **File History** or **OneDrive** for cloud backups.\n- Consider an external hard drive for offline copies.\n\n## 8. Practice Safe Browsing Habits\n\n- Use **Microsoft Edge with SmartScreen** to block malicious sites.\n- Be cautious when downloading software—prefer the Microsoft Store or official websites.\n- Avoid clicking suspicious email links or attachments.\n\nWindows 11 provides a solid foundation for security, but your habits and configurations play an equally important role. By keeping your system updated, enabling built-in protections, and practicing safe online behavior, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyberattacks.\n\nYour PC holds valuable information—treat it like a digital vault and secure it accordingly.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/improving-security-on-your-windows-11-pc/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/improving-security-on-your-windows-11-pc/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/improving-security-on-your-windows-11-pc/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/improving-security-on-your-windows-11-pc/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/improving-security-on-your-windows-11-pc/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2425)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Enable Ransomware Protection in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11ranson.webp?fit=703%2C703&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-ransomware-protection-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![How to Optimize Battery Life on Windows 11 Laptops](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11Battery.webp?fit=686%2C687&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/)\n\n[![How to Boost Performance with Built-In Tools in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11performance.webp?fit=687%2C673&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
