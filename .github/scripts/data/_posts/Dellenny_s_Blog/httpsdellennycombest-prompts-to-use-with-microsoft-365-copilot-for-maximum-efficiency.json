But like any AI tool, **the quality of what you get out of it depends heavily on what you put in**—and that means using smart, clear prompts.\n\nIn this post, we’ll walk you through the **best prompts to use with Microsoft 365 Copilot** across the key apps in the suite to help you work faster, communicate better, and make smarter decisions.\n\n## 🧠 Why Prompts Matter in Copilot\n\nCopilot is context-aware, meaning it uses data from your Microsoft 365 environment (like emails, documents, calendar invites, and chats) to generate helpful responses. But you still need to **guide it with clear instructions** to get the best results.\n\n### Think of it this way:\n\n> >\n> **Vague prompt = generic output**\n> **Precise prompt = powerful results**\n> >\n\n## 📄 Best Prompts for Word\n\nWhether you’re writing reports, proposals, or summaries, Copilot in Word is a game-changer. Try these:\n\n- **“Draft a 2-page proposal based on [Document Name or Summary] for [Client/Project].”**\n- **“Summarize this document into bullet points suitable for a presentation.”**\n- **“Rewrite this section to sound more professional and concise.”**\n- **“Add an executive summary to the top of this document.”**\n- **“Compare the tone of this document with the company’s brand voice guide.”**\n\n🔧 *Pro tip:* Provide context like target audience or purpose to shape tone and structure.\n\n## 📊 Best Prompts for Excel\n\nCopilot in Excel helps make sense of complex data quickly. Use prompts like:\n\n- **“Analyze this data and highlight any unusual trends or outliers.”**\n- **“Create a forecast for next quarter’s sales based on this dataset.”**\n- **“Generate a summary of key insights from this spreadsheet.”**\n- **“Visualize this data in a bar chart comparing monthly revenue.”**\n- **“What are the top 5 performing regions by profit margin?”**\n\n📈 *Pro tip:* Name your tables and columns clearly to help Copilot understand your data structure.\n\n## 📧 Best Prompts for Outlook\n\nWriting emails becomes much faster with Copilot in Outlook. Try:\n\n- **“Write a professional follow-up email about our meeting on [date].”**\n- **“Summarize this email thread and suggest a next action.”**\n- **“Respond to this email with a polite decline and suggest a later date.”**\n- **“Draft a reply confirming our appointment and asking for the agenda.”**\n- **“Rewrite this email to sound more friendly and informal.”**\n\n📬 *Pro tip:* You can specify tone—like formal, friendly, persuasive—to tailor your message style.\n\n## 🖼️ Best Prompts for PowerPoint\n\nFor presentations, Copilot can help you build slides quickly and creatively:\n\n- **“Create a 10-slide presentation based on this Word document.”**\n- **“Generate a title slide and agenda for a pitch to [Company Name].”**\n- **“Summarize this report into 5 key takeaway slides.”**\n- **“Add visuals to support the key points on this slide.”**\n- **“Improve the design and layout of this slide for clarity.”**\n\n🎨 *Pro tip:* Use consistent language like “professional,” “minimal,” or “modern” to guide the visual tone.\n\n## 💬 Best Prompts for Teams\n\nCopilot in Teams helps streamline meetings, chat recaps, and collaboration:\n\n- **“Summarize the key points from this meeting recording.”**\n- **“Generate action items from today’s meeting.”**\n- **“What were the decisions made in the last project sync?”**\n- **“Draft a message to the team recapping our progress and next steps.”**\n- **“Prepare a status update based on our Teams channel conversation.”**\n\n📅 *Pro tip:* Copilot can pull context from chats, files, and meetings—so be specific about sources.\n\n## 💡 Bonus Prompting Tips\n\n- **Be specific.** Include names, dates, objectives, or audience.\n- **Use action verbs.** Ask Copilot to “summarize,” “draft,” “rewrite,” “visualize,” or “analyze.”\n- **Define tone.** Words like “friendly,” “formal,” “concise,” or “data-driven” go a long way.\n- **Build iteratively.** Ask Copilot to make small improvements instead of rewriting everything at once.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot can be your digital co-worker, research assistant, data analyst, and writing coach—all in one. But to unlock its full potential, you need to treat it like a teammate: **give it the right instructions, and it’ll give you the best output.**\n\nStart experimenting with the prompts above, tweak them for your workflow, and see how much time—and mental energy—you can save.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/best-prompts-to-use-with-microsoft-365-copilot-for-maximum-efficiency/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/best-prompts-to-use-with-microsoft-365-copilot-for-maximum-efficiency/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/best-prompts-to-use-with-microsoft-365-copilot-for-maximum-efficiency/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/best-prompts-to-use-with-microsoft-365-copilot-for-maximum-efficiency/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/best-prompts-to-use-with-microsoft-365-copilot-for-maximum-efficiency/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2193)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![GPT‑5 Finally Arrives in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copiltoGPT.webp?fit=655%2C667&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/gpt%e2%80%915-finally-arrives-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n[![What Is Microsoft Copilot Studio?
