The **Secret Store Pattern** is a design principle that addresses this risk head-on.\n\nWith AWS, you have powerful tools like **AWS Secrets Manager** and **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** to implement this pattern effectively.\n\n## What is the Secret Store Pattern?\n\nThe **Secret Store Pattern** involves separating secretsâ€”such as API keys, database passwords, and private tokensâ€”from application code and storing them securely in a centralized vault. The application fetches these secrets at runtime in a secure and controlled manner.\n\n### Benefits of the Pattern:\n\n- Secrets are not stored in version control\n- Centralized management and rotation\n- Fine-grained access control and audit logging\n- Better compliance and security posture\n\n## Secret Management in AWS\n\nAWS offers two main services for secret management:\n\n### âœ… AWS Secrets Manager\n\nDesigned specifically for secrets like database credentials, API keys, and OAuth tokens. It provides:\n\n- Encryption at rest with AWS KMS\n- Automatic secret rotation\n- Fine-grained IAM-based access control\n- Native integrations with RDS and Lambda\n\n### âœ… AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store\n\nMore general-purpose (parameters + secrets). It offers:\n\n- Standard and secure string parameters\n- Integration with EC2, ECS, Lambda\n- Support for versioning and tagging\n\n> >\n> **When to use what?**\n>\n> - Use **Secrets Manager** for credentials that need rotation.\n> - Use **Parameter Store** for app configs and non-sensitive values, or secrets that donâ€™t require rotation.\n> >\n\n## Implementing the Secret Store Pattern in AWS\n\nLetâ€™s walk through the process using **AWS Secrets Manager**.\n\n### 1. **Create a Secret**\n\nYou can create secrets via the console, CLI, or CloudFormation:\n\n``` bashCopyEditaws secretsmanager create-secret \\ --name ProdDbCredentials \\ --secret-string '{\"username\":\"admin\",\"password\":\"securepass123\"}'\n\n```\n\n### 2. **Grant Access to the Application**\n\nUse **IAM roles** to give your Lambda, ECS task, or EC2 instance permission to read the secret:\n\n``` jsonCopyEdit{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:ProdDbCredentials-*\" } ] }\n\n```\n\nUse **IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA)** in EKS, or **Lambda execution roles** for serverless functions.\n\n### 3. **Access the Secret in Code**\n\nExample: Fetching a secret in Python using Boto3:\n\n``` pythonCopyEditimport boto3 import json\n\nclient = boto3.client('secretsmanager') response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId='ProdDbCredentials')\n\nsecret = json.loads(response['SecretString']) username = secret['username'] password = secret['password']\n\n```\n\n### 4. **Enable Rotation (Optional but Recommended)**\n\nSecrets Manager supports automated rotation using Lambda functions:\n\n- Choose a rotation schedule (e.g., every 30 days)\n- Attach a Lambda function that rotates the credentials (you can use AWS-provided templates)\n\n## Best Practices for Secret Management in AWS\n\n- âœ… **Never hardcode secrets** in code or configuration files.\n- âœ… Use **IAM roles** instead of long-lived credentials.\n- âœ… Rotate secrets regularlyâ€”Secrets Manager can help automate this.\n- âœ… Enable **audit logging** with AWS CloudTrail to track access.\n- âœ… Use **resource policies** and **tags** to manage access and governance.\n- âœ… Use **encryption keys (KMS)** for fine-grained encryption control.\n\n## Example Use Case: Serverless App with RDS\n\nImagine you have a **Lambda function** that connects to **Amazon RDS**. Hereâ€™s how it should securely get the DB credentials:\n\n1. Store RDS credentials in **Secrets Manager**.\n2. Assign an **IAM role** to the Lambda function with `GetSecretValue`\npermissions.\n3. In the Lambda code, fetch the secret at runtime and use it to connect to the DB.\n4. Enable **rotation** for the RDS credentials, integrated directly with Secrets Manager.\n\nThis flow ensures that:\n\n- No secrets are exposed in code\n- Credentials are rotated automatically\n- Access is logged and controlled\n\nThe **Secret Store Pattern** is essential for building secure, scalable, and compliant applications in AWS. Whether you choose **Secrets Manager** for rich secret management features or **Parameter Store** for simpler needs, both services provide secure vaults to isolate secrets from your application logic.\n\nðŸ”’ Start treating your secrets like production dataâ€”centralized, encrypted, and access-controlled.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2181)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Building Resilient Systems with Immutable Infrastructure on AWS](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/awspatterns.webp?fit=676%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/)\n\n[![Building Resilient Systems with Immutable Infrastructure on Azure](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/azurecloud.webp?fit=716%2C674&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/)\n\n[![Secret Store Pattern in Azure Using Secure Vaults for Credentials and Secrets](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Secret-Store-Patternazure.webp?fit=700%2C706&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-azure-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d"
