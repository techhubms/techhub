A major part of this vision involves **agents**—specialized AI assistants that can act on your behalf, execute tasks, or guide you through multi-step work.\n\nOver time, Microsoft has introduced and refined several of these agents: Visual Creator (often called Visual Agent), Copilot Studio, Agent Mode, Office Agent, and custom engine agents. The roadmap continues to evolve, and one of the biggest shifts involves Visual Creator.\n\n### What Was “Visual Agent” or “Visual Creator”?\n\nThe **Visual Creator** (or Visual Agent) was a built-in Copilot agent focused on visual content generation—creating images, banners, or graphics directly through Copilot Chat.\n\nHowever, in mid-2025, Microsoft announced that Visual Creator would **no longer be pre-installed** by default in Copilot Chat.\n\nThis means:\n\n- Visual Creator will not automatically appear in the agent list within Copilot.\n- Users can still add or enable it manually if their organization allows Microsoft-built agents.\n- Some users have already noticed that it has disappeared from their Copilot interfaces.\n- The ability to generate images and visual content remains available within the **Create** experience inside Copilot Chat.\n\nSo, while Visual Creator itself is being phased out of the default experience, its capabilities still exist elsewhere in the ecosystem.\n\n### Is Visual Agent Deprecated?\n\nIn software terms, “deprecated” usually means a feature is still available but planned for removal. Microsoft has not officially declared that Visual Creator is being fully retired, but its role is being **reduced and repositioned**.\n\n- Visual Creator will no longer be pre-installed.\n- Visual content creation is shifting to the new **Create** experience inside Copilot.\n- Some environments may already lack access to the original Visual Creator agent.\n- The underlying functionality remains within Copilot, just in a different form.\n\nSo, while not entirely deprecated, Visual Creator as a standalone agent is being phased out.\n\n### What Is Replacing Visual Agent?\n\nRather than a direct one-to-one replacement, Microsoft is transitioning toward a broader and more integrated agent framework. Key successors include:\n\n#### 1. The “Create” Experience in Copilot\n\nThe **Create** experience is now the main way to generate and edit visual content (images, banners, posters, and videos). Instead of opening a separate agent, users can access these tools directly inside Copilot Chat or supported Microsoft 365 apps. This offers a more seamless and unified workflow.\n\n#### 2. Agent Mode in Office Apps and Office Agent in Chat\n\nIn late 2025, Microsoft introduced **Agent Mode** in Word and Excel, with PowerPoint integration on the way. This lets users interact directly with AI inside the app, handling data, formatting, and content creation tasks naturally.\n\nAdditionally, **Office Agent** in Copilot Chat allows users to create Word documents, PowerPoint decks, and other content directly through chat.\n\nThese new modes represent Microsoft’s shift toward a single, cohesive AI framework instead of separate niche agents.\n\n#### 3. Custom Agents via Copilot Studio and SDK\n\nOrganizations can now build their own agents through **Copilot Studio** or the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK. These tools let developers create tailored AI assistants—including visual or design-focused agents—to fit specific business needs.\n\nThis approach replaces the dependency on Microsoft’s prebuilt Visual Creator with a flexible, customizable alternative.\n\n### Why Is Microsoft Making This Change?\n\nSeveral strategic reasons explain the shift:\n\n- **Streamlined user experience**: Embedding visual creation inside Copilot’s core experience removes the need for a separate interface.\n- **Better admin control**: Organizations can decide which agents to enable, improving governance and compliance.\n- **Unified AI architecture**: Microsoft’s focus is on a consistent Copilot experience powered by a single, extensible agent system.\n- **Encouragement for customization**: By emphasizing Copilot Studio and the Agents SDK, Microsoft empowers companies to design AI experiences that meet their specific needs.\n\n### What Should Users and Admins Expect?\n\n- **End users**: You may no longer see the Visual Creator agent by default. Use the **Create** experience for image or design generation.\n- **Admins**: Review your organization’s Copilot settings, as Visual Creator will no longer be automatically deployed.\n- **Developers**: Transition to Copilot Studio to build custom agents that handle visual or branded content generation.\n- **Existing users**: Any past content created with Visual Creator remains accessible in your chat history.\n\nThe **Visual Agent (Visual Creator)** is not being completely removed, but it is being **replaced and integrated** into Microsoft’s new Copilot framework.\n\nHere’s the essence of what’s changing:\n\n- Visual Creator will no longer be pre-installed or appear by default.\n- Its core features now live inside the **Create** interface within Copilot.\n- Microsoft’s future lies in **Agent Mode**, **Office Agent**, and **custom agents** via Copilot Studio.\n\nThis transition marks Microsoft’s move toward a more unified, flexible, and enterprise-ready AI environment—one where users and developers can create their own intelligent assistants without relying on isolated agents.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-copilot-and-the-future-of-visual-agent-is-it-deprecated-or-replaced/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-copilot-and-the-future-of-visual-agent-is-it-deprecated-or-replaced/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-copilot-and-the-future-of-visual-agent-is-it-deprecated-or-replaced/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-copilot-and-the-future-of-visual-agent-is-it-deprecated-or-replaced/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-copilot-and-the-future-of-visual-agent-is-it-deprecated-or-replaced/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2834)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Microsoft 365 Copilot vs Other AI Tools The Game-Changer for Modern Businesses](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m365copilotvsAI.webp?fit=771%2C753&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-copilot-vs-other-ai-tools-the-game-changer-for-modern-businesses/)\n\n[![License Plans for Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m365copilotLicense.webp?fit=763%2C773&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/license-plans-for-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n[![Crafting Better AI Images with Copilot Tips Techniques and Pitfalls](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copilotimage.webp?fit=773%2C754&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/crafting-better-ai-images-with-copilot-tips-techniques-and-pitfalls/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2834)\n\n%d",
