Windows 11 comes with several built-in features and settings that can help you get the most out of your laptop’s battery. With a few tweaks and mindful habits, you can extend your device’s runtime and reduce the number of times you reach for the charger.\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on how to optimize battery life on Windows 11 laptops:\n\n## 1. Use Battery Saver Mode\n\nWindows 11 has a built-in **Battery Saver** feature that automatically limits background activity and reduces screen brightness when your battery is low.\n\n- To enable it manually:\n1. Click on the **battery icon** in the taskbar.\n2. Select **Battery saver**.\n\nYou can also configure when Battery Saver turns on (e.g., at 20% or 30%) under **Settings &gt; System &gt; Power & battery**.\n\n## 2. Adjust Power & Sleep Settings\n\nYour power plan determines how your laptop uses energy.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; System &gt; Power & battery &gt; Power mode**.\n- Choose **Best power efficiency** for longer battery life.\n\nAlso, under **Screen and sleep**, set shorter times for your screen to turn off and your device to sleep when idle.\n\n## 3. Lower Display Brightness & Resolution\n\nThe display is one of the biggest battery drainers. To save power:\n\n- Lower your brightness using **Win + A** (Quick Settings).\n- Reduce resolution or refresh rate under **Settings &gt; Display &gt; Advanced display**, especially if you don’t need ultra-smooth visuals when on battery.\n\n## 4. Manage Background Apps\n\nMany apps continue running in the background, consuming power.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Installed apps**.\n- Select an app &gt; **Advanced options**, then set **Background apps permissions** to *Never*.\n\nThis reduces unnecessary battery usage from apps you don’t actively use.\n\n## 5. Turn Off Unused Connectivity Features\n\nWireless connections like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and location services drain your battery when left on.\n\n- Disable Bluetooth when not needed via **Quick Settings**.\n- Use **Airplane mode** if you’re working offline.\n- Turn off location access in **Settings &gt; Privacy & security &gt; Location** when unnecessary.\n\n## 6. Keep Windows and Drivers Updated\n\nMicrosoft regularly releases performance and power management improvements.\n\n- Go to **Settings &gt; Windows Update** and install the latest updates.\n- Update drivers (especially graphics and chipset) via **Device Manager** or your laptop manufacturer’s website.\n\n## 7. Unplug Peripherals & External Devices\n\nUSB drives, external hard drives, and even wireless dongles consume power. Disconnect them when not in use to extend battery runtime.\n\n## 8. Optimize Startup Programs\n\nToo many apps launching at startup can slow performance and drain power.\n\n- Open **Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)**.\n- Go to **Startup apps** and disable unnecessary ones.\n\n## 9. Use Hibernation Instead of Sleep (for Longer Breaks)\n\nSleep mode still uses some power, while Hibernation saves your session to disk and uses none.\n\n- Enable it via **Control Panel &gt; Power Options &gt; Choose what the power buttons do**.\n- Useful if you won’t use your laptop for several hours.\n\n## 10. Monitor Battery Health\n\nOver time, batteries degrade. You can generate a battery health report to check capacity.\n\n- Press **Win + X &gt; Windows Terminal (Admin)**.\n- Type: `powercfg /batteryreport`\n- Open the generated report (HTML file) to see charge cycles and overall health.\n\nIf capacity is significantly reduced, it may be time for a replacement.\n\nWindows 11 offers a variety of built-in tools to help you optimize battery life without sacrificing productivity. By combining smart settings adjustments with mindful usage habits, you can extend your laptop’s battery and keep it running efficiently for years to come.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-optimize-battery-life-on-windows-11-laptops/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2422)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Boost Performance with Built-In Tools in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11performance.webp?fit=687%2C673&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-boost-performance-with-built-in-tools-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Troubleshooting Common Windows 11 Issues](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/windows11.webp?fit=692%2C686&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/troubleshooting-common-windows-11-issues/)\n\n[![Best Windows 11 Widgets (and How to Add Them)](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/powerpages.png?fit=706%2C692&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/best-windows-11-widgets-and-how-to-add-them/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
