Yet too often, that knowledge lives in silos—locked away in personal files, project-specific teams, or tucked into someone’s memory. Building a culture of knowledge sharing isn’t just about implementing tools; it’s about creating an environment where information flows freely, collaboration thrives, and people feel empowered to contribute.\n\nMicrosoft SharePoint and Viva provide a powerful foundation to make this vision a reality. When paired together, they help organizations unlock institutional knowledge, improve productivity, and strengthen employee engagement.\n\n## Why Knowledge Sharing Matters\n\n- **Efficiency**: Employees spend less time searching for answers and more time acting on them.\n- **Innovation**: New ideas emerge when insights are exchanged across teams and disciplines.\n- **Resilience**: Knowledge doesn’t walk out the door when employees leave—it’s captured and shared.\n- **Engagement**: People feel more connected when they can contribute and access meaningful information.\n\n## SharePoint: The Hub of Organizational Knowledge\n\nSharePoint is more than a document repository—it’s the backbone for structured content and collaboration.\n\n- **Centralized Knowledge Hubs**: Create topic-specific sites and libraries to organize documents, processes, and best practices.\n- **Search & Discoverability**: Use metadata, tagging, and Microsoft Search to ensure people can quickly find what they need.\n- **Integration with Teams**: Surface SharePoint content right where people collaborate every day.\n- **Governance & Security**: Ensure that the right people have access to the right content without compromising compliance.\n\n## Viva: Bringing Knowledge into the Flow of Work\n\nWhile SharePoint houses the content, Viva brings it to life by connecting knowledge with people.\n\n- **Viva Topics**: Automatically organize content into topic pages, making it easy to discover experts, resources, and related information.\n- **Viva Connections**: Deliver personalized news and updates directly in Teams, keeping employees aligned with organizational knowledge.\n- **Viva Engage**: Encourage open dialogue and peer-to-peer sharing, creating communities of practice and interest groups.\n- **Viva Learning**: Link learning content to skills development, enabling employees to grow by accessing knowledge in context.\n\n## Steps to Build a Knowledge-Sharing Culture (and How to Do Them)\n\n### 1. Define Your Knowledge-Sharing Vision\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n- Run workshops with leadership to identify current challenges and desired outcomes.\n- Draft a short “knowledge sharing charter” that describes why it matters and how success will be measured.\n- Example goals: reduce onboarding time by 20%, ensure 90% of policies are accessible in SharePoint, or increase cross-team collaboration.\n\n### 2. Build a Solid Foundation in SharePoint\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n- Create a modern SharePoint intranet with clear navigation (e.g., “Departments,” “Projects,” “Resources”).\n- Standardize file naming conventions and metadata tagging so content is easier to search.\n- Use hub sites to connect related sites and provide a unified experience.\n- Publish key “How-to” guides and policies as pages, not just documents, to make them easier to consume.\n\n### 3. Activate Viva to Surface Knowledge\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n- Enable **Viva Topics** to automatically identify knowledge areas and create topic cards. Train subject-matter experts to curate them.\n- Roll out **Viva Connections** by customizing the dashboard with links to frequently used SharePoint sites and tools.\n- Encourage employees to use **Viva Engage** for Q&A, best-practice sharing, and peer recognition.\n- Add **Viva Learning** to Teams so employees can access training alongside their daily work.\n\n### 4. Encourage Leaders to Model Behavior\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n- Ask managers to post weekly updates as SharePoint news or Viva Engage posts.\n- Record short video reflections after projects and upload them to SharePoint.\n- Have leaders participate in Viva Engage discussions to show that knowledge sharing is valued at every level.\n\n### 5. Reward and Recognize Knowledge Sharing\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n- Launch a “Knowledge Contributor of the Month” spotlight in Viva Engage or Connections.\n- Integrate recognition programs with Microsoft Teams so kudos are visible and celebrated.\n- Tie knowledge sharing to career development by including it in performance reviews or professional growth plans.\n\n### 6. Monitor, Measure, and Improve\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n- Use SharePoint analytics to track content views, search trends, and site usage.\n- Review Viva Insights dashboards to see how engaged employees are with shared content.\n- Conduct quarterly employee surveys to understand barriers to knowledge sharing.\n- Continuously update content—retire outdated files and highlight fresh insights to keep repositories relevant.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nBuilding a culture of knowledge sharing is a journey, not a one-time project. By combining SharePoint’s robust content management with Viva’s employee experience capabilities—and by following clear, actionable steps—organizations can break down silos, empower employees, and unlock the full potential of their collective intelligence.\n\nThe result? A smarter, more engaged, and more resilient workplace where knowledge fuels success.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/building-a-culture-of-knowledge-sharing-with-sharepoint-viva/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/building-a-culture-of-knowledge-sharing-with-sharepoint-viva/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/building-a-culture-of-knowledge-sharing-with-sharepoint-viva/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/building-a-culture-of-knowledge-sharing-with-sharepoint-viva/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/building-a-culture-of-knowledge-sharing-with-sharepoint-viva/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2340)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Roll Out Microsoft 365 Features Without Overwhelming Employees](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/m365rollout.webp?fit=750%2C746&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-roll-out-microsoft-365-features-without-overwhelming-employees/)\n\n[![Managing Data Retention Policies Without Overcomplicating Things in Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/retentionm365.webp?fit=742%2C750&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/managing-data-retention-policies-without-overcomplicating-things-in-microsoft-365-2/)\n\n[![Automating Governance with ShareGate A Practical Guide for Businesses](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/governanceShareGate.webp?fit=771%2C759&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/automating-governance-with-sharegate-a-practical-guide-for-businesses/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
