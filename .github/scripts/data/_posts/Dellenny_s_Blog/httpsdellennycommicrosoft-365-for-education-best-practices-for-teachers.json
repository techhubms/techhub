Between Teams, OneNote, Forms, and the classic Word/PowerPoint/Excel apps, there‚Äôs so much to explore. The good news? Once you know where to look, these tools can actually save you time and help your students stay more organized and engaged.\n\nHere are some teacher-friendly tips (with steps!) to get the most out of Microsoft 365 for Education.\n\n## 1. Keep Your Classroom Organized with Microsoft Teams\n\nThink of **Teams** as your digital classroom. It‚Äôs where students can ask questions, access files, and turn in assignments.\n\n**How to set it up:**\n\n1. Open **Teams** and click **Join or create a team**.\n2. Choose **Class team** and name it (e.g., ‚ÄúGrade 8 ‚Äì English‚Äù).\n3. Inside the team, create **channels** for units, topics, or projects (e.g., ‚ÄúShakespeare,‚Äù ‚ÄúEssay Writing‚Äù).\n4. Pin important posts or documents so they‚Äôre always at the top.\n\nüí° **Tip for teachers:** Tell students exactly where to post homework questions (like a ‚ÄúHomework Q&A‚Äù channel). This avoids 25 emails about the same assignment.\n\n## 2. Go Paperless with OneNote Class Notebook\n\nOneNote is a digital binder for you and your students. Each student gets their own private space, plus a shared library for class materials.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. In **Teams**, go to your class team &gt; **Class Notebook** tab.\n2. Choose **Set up a OneNote Class Notebook**.\n3. Add materials to the **Content Library** (students can view but not edit).\n4. Use the **Collaboration Space** for group activities.\n5. Each student has their own notebook section‚Äîperfect for journals, practice problems, or drafts.\n\nüí° **Tip for teachers:** Use the **Draw &gt; Ink to Math** tool to solve math problems step by step, just like on a whiteboard.\n\n## 3. Check Understanding with Microsoft Forms\n\nForms is like having a quick survey or quiz tool at your fingertips.\n\n**How to create a quiz or poll:**\n\n1. Go to **forms.office.com**.\n2. Click **New Quiz** (for graded quizzes) or **New Form** (for surveys/polls).\n3. Add questions (multiple choice, short answer, rating, etc.).\n4. Click the three dots (‚Ä¶) &gt; **Settings** to make it a self-grading quiz.\n5. Share the quiz by copying the link or posting directly in Teams.\n\nüí° **Tip for teachers:** Use exit tickets! A quick 2-question form at the end of class (‚ÄúWhat did you learn? What‚Äôs still confusing?‚Äù) gives you instant feedback.\n\n## 4. Make Group Work Easier with Word, PowerPoint, and Excel Online\n\nStudents can collaborate in real time on assignments‚Äîno more ‚ÄúWho has the latest version of the file?‚Äù emails.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Create a new file in **OneDrive** or directly inside a Teams channel.\n2. Click **Share** and enter your students‚Äô names or copy the link.\n3. Everyone can work in the same document at once, and you can watch them type in real time.\n4. Use **Review &gt; Track Changes** or **Comments** to give feedback.\n\nüí° **Tip for teachers:** Show students how to turn on **Immersive Reader** (View &gt; Immersive Reader). It‚Äôs great for English learners or anyone who benefits from having text read aloud.\n\n## 5. Make Learning Accessible for Everyone\n\nMicrosoft 365 has built-in tools to help all learners succeed.\n\n- **Immersive Reader**: Reads text aloud and breaks it into syllables. (Right-click on text &gt; Immersive Reader).\n- **Live Captions** in Teams: Turn on during meetings (More actions (‚Ä¶) &gt; **Turn on live captions**).\n- **Translator**: Translate text or captions for multilingual students.\n\nüí° **Tip for teachers:** Do a quick demo in class showing students where to find these tools‚Äîmany don‚Äôt even know they‚Äôre there!\n\n## 6. Stay Safe and Model Digital Citizenship\n\nSecurity is just as important online as in the classroom.\n\n**Best practices:**\n\n- Always use your **school-issued account** (not personal email).\n- Double-check **sharing permissions** before posting files (choose ‚ÄúPeople in your organization‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúAnyone with the link‚Äù).\n- Turn on **multi-factor authentication** if your school allows it‚Äîit‚Äôs like locking your classroom door.\n\nüí° **Tip for teachers:** Have a short discussion about online behavior and digital citizenship‚Äîthings like respectful communication in Teams channels or not oversharing links.\n\nMicrosoft 365 can feel like a lot at first, but once you start using it, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever taught without it. My advice? Start small. Maybe begin with Teams for assignments and OneNote for student work. Then, once you‚Äôre comfortable, layer in Forms for quizzes or collaboration in Word/PowerPoint.\n\nThese tools can save you time, make learning more interactive, and help students take ownership of their learning. Plus, they‚Äôre full of little tricks (like Immersive Reader) that make a big difference for student success.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-for-education-best-practices-for-teachers/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-for-education-best-practices-for-teachers/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-for-education-best-practices-for-teachers/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-for-education-best-practices-for-teachers/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-for-education-best-practices-for-teachers/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2448)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Creating Custom Microsoft Teams Apps and Tabs](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Creating-custom-Teams-apps-and-tabs.webp?fit=740%2C731&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/creating-custom-microsoft-teams-apps-and-tabs/)\n\n[![What to Do When Outlook Stops Syncing](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/outlookstopsync.webp?fit=682%2C695&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/what-to-do-when-outlook-stops-syncing/)\n\n[![How to Fix Common Microsoft Teams Connection Problems](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fixteamsissues.webp?fit=670%2C706&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-common-microsoft-teams-connection-problems/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
