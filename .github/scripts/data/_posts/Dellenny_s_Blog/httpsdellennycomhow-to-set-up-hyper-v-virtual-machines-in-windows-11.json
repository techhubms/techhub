If you‚Äôre on **Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education editions**, you already have access to **Hyper-V**, Microsoft‚Äôs built-in virtualization platform.\n\nIn this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through enabling Hyper-V and setting up your first virtual machine on Windows 11.\n\n## 1. What is Hyper-V?\n\nHyper-V is Microsoft‚Äôs hypervisor technology that allows you to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single physical computer. Each VM has its own dedicated resources‚ÄîCPU, RAM, storage, and networking‚Äîso you can safely experiment without affecting your main system.\n\n## 2. System Requirements for Hyper-V on Windows 11\n\nBefore enabling Hyper-V, check that your system meets these requirements:\n\n- **Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education** (not available in Home edition by default)\n- **64-bit processor** with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)\n- **4 GB RAM or more**\n- **Hardware virtualization enabled in BIOS/UEFI** (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)\n\nüëâ To check if virtualization is enabled: Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager ‚Üí go to the **Performance** tab ‚Üí check **Virtualization** status.\n\n## 3. Enabling Hyper-V in Windows 11\n\nThere are two main ways to enable Hyper-V:\n\n### Method 1: Using Windows Features\n\n1. Press **Win + R**, type `optionalfeatures`\n, and press **Enter**.\n2. In the **Windows Features**dialog, check:\n- **Hyper-V Management Tools**\n- **Hyper-V Platform**\n3. Click **OK** and restart your PC.\n\n### Method 2: Using PowerShell\n\nRun PowerShell as Administrator and enter:\n\n``` Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All\n\n```\n\nRestart your PC when prompted.\n\n## 4. Opening Hyper-V Manager\n\nAfter rebooting, search for **Hyper-V Manager** in the Start menu. This is your main console to create, configure, and manage virtual machines.\n\n## 5. Creating Your First Virtual Machine\n\n1. In **Hyper-V Manager**, right-click your computer name ‚Üí **New ‚Üí Virtual Machine**.\n2. Follow the wizard:\n- **Name**: Enter a VM name (e.g., ‚ÄúUbuntuTest‚Äù or ‚ÄúWindows10Lab‚Äù).\n- **Generation**: Choose **Generation 2** (recommended for modern OS) unless you need legacy support.\n- **Memory**: Assign at least 2 GB (more for modern OSes).\n- **Networking**: Select a virtual switch (create one if none exists).\n- **Virtual Hard Disk**: Create a new disk or use an existing VHDX file.\n- **Installation Options**: Choose to install from an ISO file or network.\n3. Finish the wizard, then **start the VM** from Hyper-V Manager.\n\n## 6. Setting Up Networking (Optional but Recommended)\n\nTo give your VM internet access:\n\n1. Open **Virtual Switch Manager** in Hyper-V Manager.\n2. Create a **New Virtual Network Switch** ‚Üí choose **External** to connect through your physical adapter.\n3. Assign this switch to your VM‚Äôs network configuration.\n\n## 7. Installing the Guest OS\n\nOnce your VM boots from the ISO, proceed with the OS installation just as you would on a physical machine.\n\n## 8. Tips for Better Performance\n\n- Enable **Dynamic Memory** so Hyper-V adjusts RAM allocation automatically.\n- Use **Checkpoints** to save snapshots before making big changes.\n- Store VM files on a fast SSD for quicker load times.\n\nHyper-V in Windows 11 makes it easy to create and manage virtual machines without needing third-party tools. Whether you‚Äôre testing Linux, running older versions of Windows, or building a lab for IT experiments, Hyper-V provides a powerful and free solution built right into the OS.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2358)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Syncing Your Android Phone with Windows 11 Using Phone Link](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11andorid.webp?fit=767%2C751&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/syncing-your-android-phone-with-windows-11-using-phone-link/)\n\n[![How to Join and Use the Windows Insider Program](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wininsider.webp?fit=746%2C777&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-join-and-use-the-windows-insider-program/)\n\n[![Microsoft Defender Advanced Protection Tips for Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bitdefederwin11.webp?fit=746%2C754&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-defender-advanced-protection-tips-for-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
