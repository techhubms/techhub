This pattern means that once a virtual machine (VM), container, or other infrastructure component is provisioned, it is **never modified**. If changes are required (such as a software update or configuration tweak), a **new version** is built and deployed **instead of patching** the old one.\n\nIn this blog, we‚Äôll explore:\n\n- What the Immutable Infrastructure pattern is\n- Benefits of using it\n- How to implement it using **Azure services**\n- A sample deployment workflow using **Azure DevOps and ARM/Bicep/Terraform**\n\n## üöÄ What is Immutable Infrastructure?\n\nImmutable Infrastructure is a paradigm where servers or other infrastructure components are never updated in place. Instead, every change (like new app version, configuration, or patch) results in **a new, clean instance** being created and the old one being destroyed.\n\n**Mutable Infrastructure**:\n\n- You SSH into servers\n- You apply manual updates or hotfixes\n- Configuration drift is common\n- Hard to reproduce exact state\n\n**Immutable Infrastructure**:\n\n- No in-place updates\n- Each deployment creates new VMs or containers\n- Old instances are discarded\n- Consistency is guaranteed\n\n## ‚úÖ Benefits of Immutable Infrastructure\n\n- **Consistency**: Every instance is built from a defined image or template.\n- **Reliability**: You always know what‚Äôs running in production.\n- **Auditability**: Deployments are traceable and version-controlled.\n- **Rollback Friendly**: Rollbacks are as simple as redeploying a previous version.\n- **Security**: Reduces attack surface by disallowing SSH/RDP access.\n\n## üß∞ Implementing Immutable Infrastructure in Azure\n\n### üîß Step 1: Define Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\n\nUse **ARM templates**, **Bicep**, or **Terraform** to define your infrastructure. For example, define a VM or scale set as code, and version-control the template.\n\n``` bicepCopyEditresource myVm 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2021-07-01' = { name: 'app-vm-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}' location: resourceGroup().location properties: { hardwareProfile: { vmSize: 'Standard_B2s' } storageProfile: { imageReference: { publisher: 'Canonical' offer: 'UbuntuServer' sku: '18.04-LTS' version: 'latest' } osDisk: { createOption: 'FromImage' } } osProfile: { computerName: 'appvm' adminUsername: 'azureuser' adminPassword: 'SecurePassword123' } networkProfile: { networkInterfaces: [ { id: nic.id } ] } } }\n\n```\n\n### üì¶ Step 2: Use Image-Based Deployment\n\nUse **Azure Image Builder**, **Packer**, or **Shared Image Gallery** to create custom VM images with your app baked in.\n\n- Build a VM Image with all dependencies\n- Store it in **Azure Compute Gallery**\n- Use it for every deployment\n\n``` jsonCopyEdit\"imageReference\": { \"id\": \"/subscriptions/{sub-id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/galleries/{gallery}/images/{image}/versions/{version}\" }\n\n```\n\n### üì§ Step 3: Deploy Using Blue-Green or Rolling Strategy\n\nUse **Azure VM Scale Sets** or **App Service Deployment Slots** to safely roll out changes.\n\n- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deploy a new environment, shift traffic, then delete the old one.\n- **Rolling Upgrade**: Gradually replace instances with new ones using scale sets.\n\nExample with VM Scale Sets:\n\n``` jsonCopyEdit\"upgradePolicy\": { \"mode\": \"Rolling\", \"rollingUpgradePolicy\": { \"maxBatchInstancePercent\": 20, \"maxUnhealthyInstancePercent\": 20, \"pauseTimeBetweenBatches\": \"PT0S\" } }\n\n```\n\n### üîÅ Step 4: Automate Everything\n\nUse **Azure DevOps Pipelines**, **GitHub Actions**, or **Terraform Cloud** to automate:\n\n1. Image Build (CI)\n2. Infrastructure Deployment (CD)\n3. Instance Replacement\n\nPipeline Flow:\n\n``` plaintextCopyEditCode Change ‚Üí Build Image (Packer) ‚Üí Push to Azure Compute Gallery ‚Üí Deploy via ARM/Bicep ‚Üí Replace Instances ‚Üí Validate Health\n\n```\n\n## üß™ Example: Deploying Web App via Immutable Infrastructure\n\n1. **Build App Image** using Packer and Azure DevOps\n2. **Push to Azure Compute Gallery**\n3. **Update Bicep or Terraform** to reference new image version\n4. **Redeploy VM Scale Set** (new instances are created, old ones are drained and removed)\n5. **Monitor Health** via Azure Monitor / Application Insights\n\n## üßº Clean-Up Old Infrastructure\n\nMake sure to delete old resources after a successful deployment to avoid cost waste and reduce clutter.\n\nYou can automate this with:\n\n- Azure CLI scripts in pipeline\n- Azure Automation\n- Lifecycle management policies\n\nThe Immutable Infrastructure pattern is a **foundational strategy** for building secure, scalable, and maintainable cloud systems. On Azure, it‚Äôs fully supported with services like:\n\n- **Azure DevOps**\n- **Azure Compute Gallery**\n- **VM Scale Sets**\n- **Packer**\n- **Terraform / Bicep / ARM**\n- **Deployment Slots (for App Services)**\n\nBy shifting from mutable to immutable deployments, you gain confidence that every environment is reproducible, reliable, and secure.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2184)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Building Resilient Systems with Immutable Infrastructure on AWS](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/awspatterns.webp?fit=676%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/building-resilient-systems-with-immutable-infrastructure-on-aws/)\n\n[![Secret Store Pattern in AWS Using Secure Vaults for Credentials and Secrets](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/awspatterns.webp?fit=676%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-aws-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/)\n\n[![Secret Store Pattern in Azure Using Secure Vaults for Credentials and Secrets](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Secret-Store-Patternazure.webp?fit=700%2C706&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/secret-store-pattern-in-azure-using-secure-vaults-for-credentials-and-secrets/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d"
