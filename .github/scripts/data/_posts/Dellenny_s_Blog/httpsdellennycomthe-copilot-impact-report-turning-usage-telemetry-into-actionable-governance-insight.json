  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content When organizations adopt Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, the initial focus often centers on usage metrics — **MAU (Monthly Active Users)**, **DAU (Daily Active Users)**, and overall engagement trends. These metrics are essential for understanding adoption, but they only scratch the surface of what’s possible with Microsoft’s built-in Copilot telemetry.\n\nThe real opportunity lies beyond raw usage. With the right interpretation, Copilot usage data can uncover **governance blind spots**, highlight **training needs**, and guide **data protection efforts** — turning telemetry into a powerful decision-making tool for IT, compliance, and business leaders alike.\n\n## **Beyond MAU/DAU: What the Built-In Reports Reveal**\n\nMicrosoft’s Copilot for M365 Admin Center provides a range of telemetry reports that go deeper than simple usage counts. These reports can surface:\n\n- **Feature-level insights** — Which Copilot experiences (Word, Excel, Teams, etc.) are driving the most engagement\n- **Departmental or user-level trends** — Where productivity and adoption are strongest\n- **Query context** — The types of prompts being used (summarization, data exploration, drafting, etc.)\n\nBut to truly maximize the value, you need to connect these metrics to **behavioral and governance signals**.\n\n## **Identifying Teams with Poor Prompt Hygiene**\n\nNot all Copilot usage is good usage. Poorly crafted prompts can lead to frustration, inconsistent results, or even data exposure risks. Microsoft’s telemetry doesn’t capture prompt *content* directly (for privacy and security reasons), but it does offer **aggregated prompt metrics** that hint at quality.\n\nKey indicators of poor prompt hygiene include:\n\n- **High prompt-to-result ratios** — Frequent re-prompts suggest unclear or ineffective queries.\n- **Low “acceptance” or “insert” rates** — Users might be discarding Copilot’s responses, signaling poor prompt design or low trust in AI output.\n- **Unusually long prompt lengths** — Users pasting entire documents or emails into prompts might be over-sharing sensitive data.\n\nBy analyzing these patterns per department or role, admins can identify where to target **prompt-writing training** or **secure usage guidelines**.\n\n**Example Action:** If a specific team has high usage but low output adoption, conduct a short workshop on **effective Copilot prompting techniques**, such as using role-based context (“You are a financial analyst…”) or specifying tone, format, and outcome.\n\n## **Spotting High-Risk Data Queries**\n\nCopilot’s tight integration with Microsoft Graph and user permissions means it can surface information from across SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, and more. This makes governance oversight critical.\n\nUse telemetry insights to flag potential **high-risk behaviors**, such as:\n\n- **Excessive data retrieval prompts** — Users frequently asking Copilot to “summarize all project documents” or “list all contracts” may be unintentionally exposing sensitive material.\n- **Abnormal access spikes** — Sudden increases in Copilot-triggered data access from a specific user group may indicate overuse or misunderstanding of Copilot’s data scope.\n- **Cross-departmental prompts** — Requests that span multiple business units could signal weak data segmentation or over-permissive sharing policies.\n\nPairing Copilot telemetry with **Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** or **Insider Risk Management** can provide layered visibility into where and how Copilot is being used with sensitive information.\n\n## **Turning Insights into Governance Action**\n\nTelemetry insights are most powerful when linked to governance and enablement programs. Here’s how to turn data into meaningful action:\n\n1. **Set Benchmarks** — Establish what “healthy Copilot usage” looks like (e.g., 80% adoption rate with &lt;1.5 average re-prompt ratio).\n2. **Correlate with Outcomes** — Combine Copilot data with productivity KPIs, such as document turnaround times or meeting load reduction.\n3. **Close the Loop** — Feed insights into governance frameworks, training programs, and DLP rules.\n4. **Communicate the Value** — Share periodic “Copilot Impact Reports” with business units to reinforce data-driven adoption and responsible use.\n\n## **How to Monitor Copilot Telemetry in Microsoft 365 Admin Center**\n\nTo turn Copilot usage data into actionable insights, Microsoft provides built-in telemetry dashboards in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. These dashboards surface metrics about adoption, activity, and usage patterns — and are the foundation for identifying governance opportunities.\n\nBelow are the **step-by-step instructions** for accessing and interpreting these reports.\n\n### **Step 1: Access the Copilot Usage Dashboard**\n\n1. Sign in to the **[Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://admin.microsoft.com)** using an account with **Reports Reader**, **Global Reader**, or **Global Administrator** permissions.\n2. In the left-hand navigation pane, go to:\n**Reports → Usage**\n3. From the Usage page, select **“Copilot Dashboard”**.\n- You may also find it under **Microsoft 365 Apps Usage** if your tenant is newly updated.\n4. The Copilot Dashboard will display usage across key Microsoft 365 applications where Copilot is enabled (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Loop, etc.).\n\n### **Step 2: Explore Key Copilot Metrics**\n\nThe Copilot Dashboard provides multiple layers of telemetry. These are the most useful metrics for governance analysis:\n\n| **Metric** | **What It Means** | **Governance Use Case** | | --- | --- | --- | | **Active Users (MAU/DAU)** | Number of users actively using Copilot within a defined timeframe. | Identify adoption trends across departments. | | **Total Prompts Issued** | The number of Copilot interactions submitted by users. | Detect overuse or potential “data fishing” behavior. | | **Accepted vs. Rejected Suggestions** | The ratio of Copilot-generated content that users accepted or inserted. | Gauge prompt effectiveness or trust in AI output. | | **Top Apps by Usage** | Which M365 apps generate the most Copilot interactions. | Determine where governance policies need stronger focus (e.g., Copilot in Teams Chat vs. Word). | | **Prompt Type Distribution** | Aggregated by context (summarization, drafting, data analysis). | Spot risky query types, such as large-scale data summaries. |\n\n>\n> **Tip:** You can export these reports into Excel or Power BI for trend analysis, department-level comparisons, or to overlay with sensitivity label data.\n>\n\n### **Step 3: Drill Down by Department or Role**\n\n1. Use the **Filters**at the top of the Copilot Dashboard to refine your view:\n- **App Type:** Word, Excel, Teams, Outlook, etc.\n- **Date Range:** 7, 30, or 90 days.\n- **User Group:** Department, location, or role (if configured in Azure AD).\n2. Examine which teams or departments show:\n- **High prompt counts with low acceptance rates** → poor prompt hygiene.\n- **Abnormally high data exploration queries** → possible data overreach.\n- **Sudden adoption spikes** → potential training or governance gap.\n\n>\n> **Governance Example:**\n> If your finance department shows 3x higher prompt volumes than average, with low response adoption, investigate if users are querying sensitive files or struggling with unclear prompt design.\n>\n\n### **Step 4: Correlate with Compliance & Security Insights**\n\nFor deeper governance insights, combine telemetry data from the Copilot Dashboard with other Microsoft security and compliance tools:\n\n- **Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Detect sensitive data being surfaced by Copilot prompts.\n- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps:** Monitor unusual data access patterns or excessive API calls.\n- **Insider Risk Management:** Identify repeated high-risk prompt patterns (e.g., “export all project data”).\n- **Audit Logs (via Microsoft Purview):** Track detailed Copilot activity at the user or event level.\n\n>\n> By correlating telemetry and compliance data, you can proactively adjust permissions, retrain users, or refine Copilot governance policies.\n>\n\n### **Step 5: Automate Reporting in Power BI**\n\nFor advanced monitoring and executive reporting:\n\n1. Go to **Reports → Usage → View More Reports** in the Admin Center.\n2. Select **Export to Power BI** (or use the **Microsoft 365 Usage Analytics** Power BI template).\n3. Connect to your tenant and enable **Copilot Usage Dataset**.\n4. Build custom dashboards showing:\n- Copilot adoption by department or role.\n- Prompt efficiency ratios (accepted vs. rejected).\n- Risk classification overlay (if integrated with Purview).\n\nThese visualizations make it easier to brief stakeholders on **adoption health**, **productivity impact**, and **risk posture**.\n\n### **Step 6: Operationalize the Insights**\n\nOnce your telemetry monitoring is in place, convert insights into governance actions:\n\n- **Train:** Launch “Prompt Hygiene 101” micro-trainings for low-performing teams.\n- **Protect:** Adjust data access controls where Copilot is over-querying sensitive repositories.\n- **Report:** Publish monthly **Copilot Impact Reports** to track improvements in usage quality and data safety.\n\nMonitoring Copilot telemetry through the Microsoft 365 Admin Center gives IT and compliance teams visibility not just into **who’s using Copilot**, but **how** they’re using it. By combining these reports with security and compliance tools, organizations can build a governance model that’s both **data-driven** and **actionable**.\n\nCopilot usage telemetry isn’t just about proving adoption — it’s a window into **organizational behavior** and **information governance**. By moving beyond basic MAU/DAU metrics and exploring deeper telemetry signals, IT leaders can:\n\n- Detect poor prompt hygiene early\n- Identify potential data exposure risks\n- Drive targeted enablement and governance initiatives\n\nThe goal isn’t just to measure how much Copilot is used — it’s to understand **how it’s used**, and to ensure that every prompt contributes to both productivity and compliance.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/the-copilot-impact-report-turning-usage-telemetry-into-actionable-governance-insights/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/the-copilot-impact-report-turning-usage-telemetry-into-actionable-governance-insights/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/the-copilot-impact-report-turning-usage-telemetry-into-actionable-governance-insights/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/the-copilot-impact-report-turning-usage-telemetry-into-actionable-governance-insights/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/the-copilot-impact-report-turning-usage-telemetry-into-actionable-governance-insights/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
