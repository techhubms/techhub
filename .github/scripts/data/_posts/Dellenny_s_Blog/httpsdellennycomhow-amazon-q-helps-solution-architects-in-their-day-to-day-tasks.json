Enter **Amazon Q**, AWS’s generative AI assistant—designed to lighten the load across both development—and business-oriented workflows. Whether via **Amazon Q Developer** or **Amazon Q Business**, this AI companion can transform repetitive or complex tasks into lightning-speed productivity.\n\n## 1. Amazon Q Developer: Your AI-Powered DevOps Partner\n\n**Coding, Reviewing & Securing** SAs can have Amazon Q Developer generate unit tests, detect vulnerabilities, fix code smells, and even produce **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) for CloudFormation, CDK, or Terraform.\n\n**Documentation & Onboarding** Need to understand or document legacy systems? Amazon Q Developer can generate **in-depth documentation**, readme files, and even **data flow diagrams**—great for quickly getting new team members oriented.\n\n**Account Insights** Ask Amazon Q Developer about your current infrastructure—like active EC2 instances in a specific region—it can summarize account resources and billing, all respecting your AWS permissions.\n\n**Architecture Diagrams via CLI** Use the Amazon Q Developer CLI plus the AWS Diagram MCP (Model Context Protocol) to automatically generate AWS architecture diagrams via natural-language prompts, complete with best-practices checks.\n\n> >\n> **Bottom Line**: You can rely on Amazon Q Developer as a DevOps sidekick—boosting code quality, operational clarity, and diagrammed architecture in minutes instead of hours.\n> >\n\n## 2. Amazon Q Business: The Generative AI for Enterprise Workflows\n\n**Unified Insights Across Data** Amazon Q Business lets SAs query across multiple repositories—documents, dashboards, wikis, emails, databases, and more—with transparent, citational responses.\n\n**Lightweight AI Apps** Build Amazon Q Apps in natural language—like automating infrastructure summaries, change log generation, or report generation—and share them organization-wide.\n\n**Cross-Application Actions** Trigger tasks in Jira, PagerDuty, Salesforce, and more—all from within Amazon Q Business—and automate workflows across tools without context-switching.\n\n**Integrated with QuickSight** Ask for visual dashboards using plain language. Amazon Q in QuickSight adapts to your query to build visualizations and complex BI reports instantly.\n\n## 3. Real-World Use Cases for Solution Architects\n\n- **Rapid Architecture Drafting**\nGenerate diagrams showing VPCs, subnets, ECS clusters, or RDS instances—all following AWS best practices.\n- **Automated IaC Generation**\nNeed CloudFormation or CDK snippets for new services? Let Amazon Q Developer generate, comment, and source it—all ready for customization.\n- **Code Review & Security**\nAmazon Q flags logic flaws, anti-patterns, exposed credentials, and suggests remediation—reducing manual code review time and elevating code quality.\n- **Emailing Design Summaries**\nUsing Amazon Q Business, you can build an app that drafts a design summary email complete with architecture diagrams and key notes—automatically.\n- **Onboarding Support**\nNew SAs can ask Amazon Q Business to walk them through production network topologies and get curated summaries with diagrams.\n\n## 4. Security & Best-Practice Considerations\n\n- **Opt Out of Data Sharing**\nAmazon Q Developer (Free Tier) may share interactions for model improvement. Pro or Business plans don’t. Admins can also opt out via organizational policies or IDE settings.\n- **Recent Security Incident Reminder**\nIn July 2025, a malicious prompt was inserted into the Amazon Q Developer VS Code extension—though it failed to execute and AWS addressed it quickly with a patched release and updated code review policies.\n- **Upcoming Changes**\nAWS is reportedly consolidating AI tools—including QuickSight, Q Business, and Q Apps—into a future **Q Business Suite (QBS)** to streamline enterprise experience and functionality.\n\n## 5. Example Prompts for Solution Architects\n\nHere are some ready-to-use prompts to speed up day-to-day work:\n\n- **Architecture Design**\n- “Generate an AWS architecture diagram for a highly available web app with two Availability Zones, an ALB, auto-scaling EC2 instances, and RDS Multi-AZ.”\n- “Suggest best practices for securing S3 buckets that store PII.”\n- **Infrastructure as Code**\n- “Write a CloudFormation template for an ECS Fargate service fronted by an Application Load Balancer.”\n- “Convert this Terraform snippet into AWS CDK (TypeScript).”\n- **Code & Review**\n- “Review this Lambda function for performance bottlenecks and security risks.”\n- “Generate unit tests for this API Gateway + Lambda integration.”\n- **Onboarding & Documentation**\n- “Summarize the architecture of our production VPC, including subnets, NAT gateways, and route tables.”\n- “Create a README for a microservice that uses DynamoDB, API Gateway, and Lambda.”\n- **Business Insights**\n- “Show me a QuickSight dashboard summarizing EC2 costs by region.”\n- “Draft an email summarizing the pros and cons of migrating from RDS MySQL to Aurora PostgreSQL.”\n\n## 6. Summary Table\n\n| Task Category | How Amazon Q Helps | | --- | --- | | Design & Architecture | Generates diagrams using CLI + MCP; creates IaC snippets | | Documentation & Onboarding | Auto-docs, readmes, data flow visuals | | Code Quality & Security | Scans code, flags vulnerabilities, proposes fixes | | Reporting & BI | Natural-language dashboards via QuickSight integration | | Workflow Automation | Builds lightweight Q Apps; takes actions across tools |\n\nAmazon Q (Developer and Business) equips Solution Architects with AI-powered efficiency: whether you’re designing systems, automating deployments, visualizing architecture, or coordinating stakeholder communications. Just be sure to verify the output (especially with code and security), stay updated on AWS’s future tooling (like QBS), and manage permissions intelligently.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-amazon-q-helps-solution-architects-in-their-day-to-day-tasks/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-amazon-q-helps-solution-architects-in-their-day-to-day-tasks/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-amazon-q-helps-solution-architects-in-their-day-to-day-tasks/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-amazon-q-helps-solution-architects-in-their-day-to-day-tasks/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-amazon-q-helps-solution-architects-in-their-day-to-day-tasks/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2463)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![How to Migrate Legacy Applications Using GitHub Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GitHubCopilot3.webp?fit=773%2C748&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-migrate-legacy-applications-using-github-copilot/)\n\n[![Service Discovery in Azure Dynamically Finding Service Instances](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/azureservicediscovery.webp?fit=758%2C752&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/service-discovery-in-azure-dynamically-finding-service-instances/)\n\n[![Combining Generative AI and Business Logic with Copilot Studio](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/copilot1.webp?fit=762%2C769&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/combining-generative-ai-and-business-logic-with-copilot-studio/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
