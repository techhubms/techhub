From syncing errors to disappearing sections, many users experience issues that can disrupt productivity. The good news? Most of these problems have straightforward fixes.\n\nHere’s a guide to resolving the most common OneNote issues.\n\n### 1. Sync Errors\n\n**Problem:** Notes don’t update across devices, or you see a sync error message.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Go to **File → Info → View Sync Status** in the desktop app.\n- Click **Sync Now** for the affected notebook.\n- Ensure you’re connected to the internet.\n- If syncing to OneDrive, verify that you’re signed into the correct account.\n\n### 2. Disappearing or “New Section” Issues\n\n**Problem:** Old sections suddenly appear as “New Section” or “New Section Group.”\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Check the notebook’s sync status.\n- Switch to a different navigation layout (horizontal vs vertical tabs) to reveal hidden sections.\n- Clear OneNote’s local cache: close OneNote, navigate to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\OneNote\\<version>\\`\n, and delete/rename the **Cache** folder.\n- Reopen OneNote to force a fresh download of content from the cloud.\n\n### 3. OneNote Not Opening or Crashing\n\n**Problem:** OneNote freezes or won’t launch.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Update Office/OneNote to the latest version.\n- Repair Office via **Control Panel → Programs → Office → Change → Repair**.\n- If using the Windows 10 OneNote app, uninstall and reinstall it from the Microsoft Store.\n\n### 4. Slow Performance\n\n**Problem:** OneNote lags when switching pages or typing.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Reduce notebook size by archiving old content into separate notebooks.\n- Close notebooks you don’t use frequently.\n- Check for large embedded files (PDFs, videos) and move them elsewhere.\n\n### 5. Can’t Find Notes\n\n**Problem:** You know you wrote something, but it seems lost.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Use the search bar (Ctrl + F for page, Ctrl + E for all notebooks).\n- Check the “Misplaced Sections” area at the bottom of the notebook list.\n- Verify you’re signed into the right Microsoft account.\n\n### 6. Ink and Drawing Issues\n\n**Problem:** Stylus or drawing tools don’t work properly.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Update your graphics driver and Windows Ink settings.\n- Adjust OneNote settings: go to **File → Options → Advanced** and check **Disable hardware graphics acceleration**.\n- Recalibrate your stylus if using a tablet.\n\n### 7. Sharing and Collaboration Problems\n\n**Problem:** Others can’t see your updates or get “read-only” errors.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Make sure your notebook is stored in OneDrive or SharePoint, not locally.\n- Confirm that collaborators have proper permissions (Edit access).\n- Resend the share link if needed.\n\n### 8. Audio and Video Recording Not Working\n\n**Problem:** Can’t record or play back media in notes.\n\n**Fix:**\n\n- Check microphone and camera permissions in Windows settings.\n- Update your sound and video drivers.\n- Test in another app to confirm the hardware works.\n\n### Final Tips to Keep OneNote Running Smoothly\n\n- Keep the app updated.\n- Regularly back up your notebooks.\n- Avoid bloating a single notebook with too many sections.\n- Use one Microsoft account per notebook to reduce sync confusion.\n\nOneNote is a robust note-taking app, but glitches can happen. Most issues—from sync problems to performance lags—can be fixed by clearing the cache, repairing the app, or managing notebooks more efficiently. By following the steps above, you can get back to capturing your thoughts without interruption.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-common-onenote-issues-a-complete-troubleshooting-guide/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-common-onenote-issues-a-complete-troubleshooting-guide/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-common-onenote-issues-a-complete-troubleshooting-guide/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-common-onenote-issues-a-complete-troubleshooting-guide/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-common-onenote-issues-a-complete-troubleshooting-guide/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2641)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Staying Connected on the Road How Travelers Can Make the Most of Microsoft Teams](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/teamsTravelers.webp?fit=725%2C718&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/staying-connected-on-the-road-how-travelers-can-make-the-most-of-microsoft-teams/)\n\n[![How to Build a No-Code Business Workflow in Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365workflows.webp?fit=705%2C702&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-build-a-no-code-business-workflow-in-microsoft-365/)\n\n[![Stress-Free Travel How to Use Microsoft 365 and Copilot to Plan Your Vacation or Business Trip](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/travelCopilot.webp?fit=723%2C729&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/stress-free-travel-how-to-use-microsoft-365-and-copilot-to-plan-your-vacation-or-business-trip/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
