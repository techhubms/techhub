But before purchasing the full version, Microsoft offers two excellent ways to explore its features without upfront cost: the **Microsoft 365 Free Trial** and the **Microsoft 365 Developer Program**. Each option is designed for a different audience and provides unique tools, services, and access benefits.\n\nIn this article, we’ll break down what each version includes, how they differ, and which one might be the best fit for your needs.\n\n## **Understanding Microsoft 365 Free Trial**\n\nThe **Microsoft 365 Free Trial** is a limited-time subscription that gives users a full experience of the suite’s premium features—at no cost. Most users receive a **30-day free trial**, and it includes applications and services typically offered in paid Microsoft 365 Personal or Family plans.\n\n### **What You Get in the Free Trial**\n\n#### **1. Full Access to Microsoft Office Applications**\n\nDuring the free trial, you can use the full premium versions of:\n\n- Microsoft Word\n- Microsoft Excel\n- Microsoft PowerPoint\n- Outlook\n- OneNote\n- Access (PC only)\n- Publisher (PC only)\n\nThese are not simplified web versions; you receive the complete desktop applications with all advanced features unlocked.\n\n#### **2. 1 TB Cloud Storage on OneDrive**\n\nCloud storage is a major part of Microsoft 365’s value. With the trial, users get:\n\n- 1 TB of secure OneDrive storage\n- File syncing across devices\n- Automatic photo backup on mobile\n- Real-time collaboration in documents\n\nThis storage continues after subscription if users decide to upgrade.\n\n#### **3. Microsoft Teams Access**\n\nThe free trial includes the full experience of **Microsoft Teams**, including:\n\n- Chat\n- Online meetings\n- Video calls\n- File sharing\n- Integration with Office apps\n\nTeams has become essential for remote work, online learning, and business communication.\n\n#### **4. AI-Powered Productivity Features**\n\nMicrosoft 365 includes smart tools that enhance productivity, such as:\n\n- Editor for grammar suggestions\n- PowerPoint design ideas\n- Data analysis and formulas in Excel\n- Cloud-based autosave and version history\n\nUsers get complete access to these tools during the trial period.\n\n#### **5. Premium Email Experience in Outlook**\n\nWith Microsoft 365, Outlook provides:\n\n- Customizable inbox filtering\n- Better spam protection\n- Calendar integration\n- 50 GB mailbox storage\n\nThe experience is smooth, secure, and fully professional.\n\n#### **6. Multi-Device Installation**\n\nThe free trial allows installation on multiple devices, including:\n\n- Windows computers\n- macOS devices\n- iOS\n- Android\n\nUsers can sign in on multiple devices and switch seamlessly between them.\n\n## **What Happens After the Trial Ends?**\n\nOnce the trial expires:\n\n- You must upgrade to continue using the premium apps.\n- Files stored in OneDrive remain accessible, but new cloud syncing and editing features may stop.\n- You may lose access to advanced features until payment is made.\n\nThe trial is designed to demonstrate the full value of a subscription before making a purchase decision.\n\n## **Understanding Microsoft 365 Developer Program**\n\nThe **Microsoft 365 Developer Program** is different from the standard trial. This program is intended for:\n\n- Developers\n- IT professionals\n- Technical students\n- Software builders\n- Businesses testing integrations\n\nIt offers a **renewable Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription**, which is packed with enterprise-grade tools for creating and testing apps and services.\n\n### **What’s Included in the Developer Program**\n\n#### **1. Free Microsoft 365 E5 Sandbox**\n\nMembers get access to a **90-day developer subscription**, which often renews automatically if you remain active. This includes:\n\n- Exchange\n- SharePoint\n- Teams\n- OneDrive\n- Graph API\n- Security and compliance tools\n\nThis is a full enterprise license—not a limited or restricted trial.\n\n#### **2. Sample Data Packs**\n\nSetting up a development environment from scratch can take hours, so Microsoft provides optional test data, including:\n\n- Fake users\n- Sample files\n- Messages\n- SharePoint sites\n\nThis helps developers simulate real business environments instantly.\n\n#### **3. Enterprise-Level Security and Identity Tools**\n\nSubscribers get access to:\n\n- Azure Active Directory\n- Multi-factor authentication\n- Conditional access policies\n- Microsoft Defender protection tools\n\nThis allows developers to test apps securely in real corporate-style conditions.\n\n#### **4. Access to Microsoft Graph API**\n\nMicrosoft Graph is one of the most powerful development tools available, enabling secure integration with:\n\n- Emails\n- Files\n- Users\n- Calendars\n- Microsoft 365 services\n\nThe Developer Program allows developers to build and test apps against live enterprise data models.\n\n#### **5. Microsoft Teams Development Environment**\n\nThe subscription supports creation of:\n\n- Teams bots\n- Meeting apps\n- Message extensions\n- Custom tabs and workflows\n\nWith Teams becoming a major communication hub, this is valuable for modern business development.\n\n#### **6. Continuous Sandbox Renewal**\n\nAs long as your subscription remains active—meaning you log in and use the services—the 90-day subscription can continue renewing, making it nearly a permanent free environment for long-term development.\n\n## **Microsoft 365 Free Trial vs. Developer Program: Key Differences**\n\n| Feature | Free Trial | Developer Program | | --- | --- | --- | | Duration | 30 days | 90 days, auto-renewable | | Target Users | General consumers | Developers and IT professionals | | Office Apps | Full desktop apps | Web-based apps with developer tools | | Tools Included | Teams, OneDrive, Office apps | Graph API, E5 sandbox, enterprise security | | Data Packages | No sample data | Includes sample users and content | | Purpose | Try before buying | Build, test, integrate apps |\n\n## **Which One Should You Choose?**\n\n### **Choose the Free Trial If You Want To:**\n\n- See if Microsoft 365 is the right productivity suite for you\n- Use premium apps like Excel, Word, and PowerPoint\n- Test how Microsoft 365 works for school, home, or business tasks\n- Experience Teams and Outlook without commitment\n\n### **Choose the Developer Program If You Want To:**\n\n- Build enterprise-level applications\n- Integrate software with Teams, OneDrive, or Outlook\n- Test identity and security features\n- Use Microsoft Graph and APIs\n- Develop solutions in a long-term test environment\n\nBoth the **Microsoft 365 Free Trial** and the **Microsoft 365 Developer Program** provide exceptional value—but they are designed for different audiences. The free trial is perfect for users who want to experience the full productivity suite before subscribing, while the Developer Program is best for those looking to build applications or explore advanced enterprise environments.\n\nWhether you’re an everyday user, student, business professional, or developer, Microsoft offers a flexible way to explore the ecosystem without paying upfront.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/whats-included-in-microsoft-365-free-trial-and-developer-program/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/whats-included-in-microsoft-365-free-trial-and-developer-program/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/whats-included-in-microsoft-365-free-trial-and-developer-program/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/whats-included-in-microsoft-365-free-trial-and-developer-program/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/whats-included-in-microsoft-365-free-trial-and-developer-program/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[Microsoft 365](https://dellenny.com/tag/microsoft-365-2/ \"Microsoft 365\")\n\n[previousUsing Microsoft 365 on Mobile Devices Effectively](https://dellenny.com/using-microsoft-365-on-mobile-devices-effectively/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
