  "EnhancedContent": "# Shared Responsibility Model in Azure Explained (with Real Examples)\n\n- by [Dellenny](https://dellenny.com/author/delenyprogmail-com/)\n- November 5, 2025November 5, 2025\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Shared-Responsibility-Model-in-Azure.jpg?fit=298%2C300&amp;ssl=1)\n\nIn today’s cloud-first world, Microsoft Azure is one of the most popular cloud platforms used by organizations globally. While Azure provides a robust infrastructure and wide-ranging services, it is crucial for businesses to understand their responsibilities in maintaining security, compliance, and operational efficiency. This is where the **Shared Responsibility Model in Azure** comes into play.\n\nThe **Shared Responsibility Model** defines the division of security and operational duties between the cloud provider (Azure) and the customer. Understanding this model ensures that organizations know which security measures are handled by Microsoft and which ones they need to manage themselves.\n\n## What is the Shared Responsibility Model?\n\nThe Shared Responsibility Model is a framework that clarifies who is responsible for what in cloud environments. Essentially, it differentiates responsibilities based on the type of service being used:\n\n- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** – Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.\n- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** – Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.\n- **Software as a Service (SaaS)** – Delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for local installation.\n\nAzure, like other cloud providers, manages certain aspects of security and operations. However, the customer also holds responsibility for managing and securing specific areas, depending on the service model.\n\n## Responsibilities in Azure’s Shared Responsibility Model\n\n### 1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**\n\nIn an IaaS model, Azure provides physical infrastructure, networking, storage, and virtualization, while customers manage:\n\n- Operating system updates and patches\n- Applications installed on virtual machines\n- Data stored on disks\n- Network configurations such as firewalls and access controls\n\n**Example:** Imagine you deploy a Windows Server VM on Azure. Microsoft ensures the underlying hardware and hypervisor are secure. However, you must install Windows updates, configure the firewall, and protect any data stored on the VM.\n\n### 2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**\n\nWith PaaS, Azure manages the underlying infrastructure, operating systems, and runtime environments, while the customer focuses on the application and data. Responsibilities include:\n\n- Application code security\n- Data protection and encryption\n- User access management and authentication\n\n**Example:** Using Azure App Service to host a web application means Microsoft handles server maintenance and scaling. You, on the other hand, must ensure your code is secure, apply application-level security controls, and manage sensitive customer data properly.\n\n### 3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**\n\nIn SaaS offerings like **Microsoft 365**, Microsoft handles nearly all infrastructure, platform, and application security. Customers are primarily responsible for:\n\n- Identity and access management\n- Data governance and classification\n- Client-side security configurations\n\n**Example:** In Microsoft Teams, Microsoft ensures uptime, patching, and platform security. Your role is to manage who can access Teams, monitor sensitive data sharing, and implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for users.\n\n## Why the Shared Responsibility Model is Important\n\nUnderstanding the Shared Responsibility Model is essential because misinterpreting responsibilities can lead to data breaches, compliance failures, or service disruptions. Companies often assume the cloud provider handles everything, which is a common misconception known as the **“Cloud Security Fallacy.”**\n\nBy clearly defining responsibilities:\n\n- Organizations can prevent security gaps\n- Compliance with industry regulations becomes easier\n- Risk management improves, protecting both data and reputation\n\n## Real-World Examples of Shared Responsibility in Azure\n\n### Example 1: Securing Virtual Machines (IaaS)\n\nA company running a web application on Azure VMs must:\n\n- Apply OS patches regularly\n- Configure network security groups (NSGs) to limit traffic\n- Encrypt storage using Azure Disk Encryption\n\nAzure ensures that the hypervisor, physical servers, and underlying networking are secure. The customer handles everything from the VM OS up.\n\n### Example 2: Protecting Azure SQL Database (PaaS)\n\nFor a SaaS-like PaaS database:\n\n- Azure automatically handles database patching, backups, and replication\n- The company manages database access, roles, and encryption of sensitive data\n\nThis division simplifies operations while ensuring security responsibilities are not neglected.\n\n### Example 3: Data Governance in Microsoft 365 (SaaS)\n\nA firm using Microsoft 365 must:\n\n- Configure proper access controls using Azure Active Directory\n- Classify sensitive emails and documents\n- Enable Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies\n\nMicrosoft handles system updates, infrastructure security, and application uptime, leaving data governance and access control to the customer.\n\n## Best Practices for Azure Shared Responsibility\n\n1. **Understand Your Service Model:** Identify whether you are using IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. Responsibility changes based on the model.\n2. **Implement Identity & Access Management:** Always apply least privilege principles, MFA, and role-based access controls.\n3. **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit. Use Azure Key Vault to securely manage keys.\n4. **Regular Monitoring & Auditing:** Utilize Azure Monitor and Security Center to track anomalies and compliance gaps.\n5. **Security Updates & Patching:** For IaaS, patch your OS and applications regularly. For PaaS, ensure your code is secure.\n\nThe **Shared Responsibility Model in Azure** is not just a theoretical concept—it is a practical guide for ensuring cloud security, operational integrity, and regulatory compliance. By understanding which responsibilities lie with Azure and which lie with your organization, businesses can maximize the benefits of cloud computing while minimizing risks.\n\nWhether you’re deploying VMs, running applications on PaaS, or leveraging SaaS solutions like Microsoft 365, knowing your role in security and management is critical. Following best practices and real-world examples ensures that both your data and your users are protected effectively.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/shared-responsibility-model-in-azure-explained-with-real-examples/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/shared-responsibility-model-in-azure-explained-with-real-examples/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/shared-responsibility-model-in-azure-explained-with-real-examples/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/shared-responsibility-model-in-azure-explained-with-real-examples/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/shared-responsibility-model-in-azure-explained-with-real-examples/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[Azure](https://dellenny.com/tag/azure-2/ \"Azure\")\n\n[previousIdentity in Azure Understanding Azure AD, Authentication, and Authorization](https://dellenny.com/identity-in-azure-understanding-azure-ad-authentication-and-authorization/)\n\n%d",
