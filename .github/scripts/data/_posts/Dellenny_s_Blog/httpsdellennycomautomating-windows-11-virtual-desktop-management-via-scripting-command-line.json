However, if you’re someone who thrives on automation — or simply wants to switch desktops or create new ones without clicking through the task view — you’ll be happy to know that you can manage virtual desktops using command-line tools and scripts.\n\nIn this post, we’ll explore how to automate virtual desktop actions such as **creating, deleting, renaming, and switching between desktops** using both **PowerShell** and **third-party command-line utilities**.\n\n## Why Automate Virtual Desktops?\n\nIf you use multiple desktops for different contexts — work, development, research, or entertainment — automation can save time and reduce friction. For instance, you can:\n\n- Launch a “Work” desktop with all necessary apps open at once.\n- Bind shortcuts to specific desktops.\n- Automatically reorganize windows during startup.\n- Integrate desktop management into productivity scripts.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nWindows 11 doesn’t natively expose built-in command-line utilities for managing virtual desktops. However, with a combination of **PowerShell**, **VirtualDesktop PowerShell module**, and **third-party tools**, we can achieve full control through automation.\n\n## Option 1: Using the VirtualDesktop PowerShell Module\n\nOne of the most flexible methods is the community-developed module [`VirtualDesktop`](https://github.com/MScholtes/VirtualDesktop). It uses the Windows Virtual Desktop API to let you script almost any action.\n\n### Step 1: Install the Module\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator and run:\n\n``` Install-Module -Name VirtualDesktop -Scope CurrentUser\n\n```\n\nIf prompted, confirm installation and the NuGet provider.\n\n### Step 2: Import the Module\n\n``` Import-Module VirtualDesktop\n\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create and Manage Desktops\n\nNow you can automate desktop management easily.\n\n#### Create a new virtual desktop:\n\n``` New-Desktop\n\n```\n\n#### List all desktops:\n\n``` Get-Desktop\n\n```\n\n#### Switch to a specific desktop:\n\n``` (Get-Desktop | Select-Object -First 1).Switch()\n\n```\n\n#### Move the current window to another desktop:\n\n``` Move-WindowToDesktop -Desktop (Get-Desktop | Select-Object -Last 1)\n\n```\n\n#### Rename desktops:\n\n``` (Get-Desktop)[0].Name = \"Work\" (Get-Desktop)[1].Name = \"Research\"\n\n```\n\n#### Remove a desktop:\n\n``` (Get-Desktop | Select-Object -Last 1).Remove()\n\n```\n\nThese commands can be combined into scripts or startup automation sequences.\n\n## Option 2: Using Command-Line Tools (VirtualDesktopCmd)\n\nIf you prefer working purely from the command line (e.g., for batch files), the open-source tool [`VirtualDesktopCmd`](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopCmd) is excellent.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n``` VirtualDesktopCmd.exe /create VirtualDesktopCmd.exe /switch:2 VirtualDesktopCmd.exe /remove:3\n\n```\n\nYou can integrate this in **.bat**, **PowerShell**, or **AutoHotkey** scripts to automate movement between desktops or bind them to custom hotkeys.\n\n## Option 3: Automating with AutoHotkey\n\nFor even more control — like hotkeys that switch or create desktops — use AutoHotkey.\n\nHere’s an example script that creates and switches desktops dynamically:\n\n``` #Include VirtualDesktop.ahk\n\n; Ctrl + Alt + N to create new desktop ^!n::VD_Create()\n\n; Ctrl + Alt + Right to move to next desktop ^!Right::VD_Next()\n\n; Ctrl + Alt + Left to move to previous desktop ^!Left::VD_Prev()\n\n```\n\nCombine this with startup scripts to create consistent desktop layouts every time you boot.\n\n## Automating at Startup\n\nIf you want your virtual desktop setup to load automatically:\n\n1. Create a PowerShell script with your desktop creation commands.\n2. Save it as a `.ps1`\nfile.\n3. Add it to **Task Scheduler** under “Run at startup.”\n\nThis ensures your workspace is recreated exactly the way you like it — automatically.\n\nAlthough Windows 11 doesn’t yet offer a native command-line interface for managing virtual desktops, PowerShell modules and tools like `VirtualDesktopCmd` or AutoHotkey bridge that gap beautifully. Whether you’re scripting your workspace setup, automating focus workflows, or just saving a few clicks, these methods can make your Windows experience feel far more dynamic and personalized.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/automating-windows-11-virtual-desktop-management-via-scripting-command-line/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/automating-windows-11-virtual-desktop-management-via-scripting-command-line/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/automating-windows-11-virtual-desktop-management-via-scripting-command-line/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/automating-windows-11-virtual-desktop-management-via-scripting-command-line/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/automating-windows-11-virtual-desktop-management-via-scripting-command-line/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\n## Related Posts\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
