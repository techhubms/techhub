One of the handiest—but often overlooked—is the **“Show hidden items”** toggle in File Explorer. Pair that with customizing the new **Windows 11 context menu**, and you can speed up your workflow dramatically.\n\nIn this post, I’ll show you how to:\n\n- Reconfigure the **Windows 11 hidden context menu** (aka the “classic right-click menu”).\n- Add the **“Show hidden items”** toggle to a quick-access shortcut.\n- Apply a few bonus tweaks for faster navigation.\n\n## 1. Understanding the Hidden Context Menu in Windows 11\n\nIf you’ve upgraded to Windows 11, you’ve probably noticed the **simplified right-click menu**. Many familiar options like “Open with” or “Properties” are hidden behind the “Show more options” button (or pressing **Shift + F10**).\n\nThis streamlined menu looks modern, but power users may prefer having direct access to the old context menu.\n\n### How to restore the classic right-click menu:\n\n1. Open **Registry Editor** (press `Win + R`\n, type `regedit` , hit Enter).\n2. Navigate to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID`\n3. Right-click **CLSID** → **New → Key**. Name it: `{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}`\n4. Inside that new key, create another key called: `InprocServer32`\n5. Double-click the **(Default)** value in `InprocServer32`\nand leave it blank (hit OK).\n6. Restart Windows Explorer (or reboot).\n\nNow, every right-click will bring up the full classic context menu by default—no extra clicks needed.\n\n## 2. Adding a Shortcut for “Show Hidden Items”\n\nIn File Explorer, the **“Show hidden items”** toggle is buried under the **View → Show** submenu. Power users often need it quickly, especially when digging into system folders.\n\nHere are two ways to speed it up:\n\n### Option A: Keyboard Shortcut\n\n- Open File Explorer.\n- Press **Alt + V** (opens the View menu).\n- Then press **H**.\n\nThis sequence toggles hidden items instantly. You can train your muscle memory to make it second nature.\n\n### Option B: Quick Access Toolbar\n\n1. Open File Explorer.\n2. Click the **down-arrow** at the top (Customize Quick Access Toolbar).\n3. Select **More Commands…**.\n4. Under “Choose commands from,” pick **View Tab**.\n5. Add **Hidden items** to the Quick Access Toolbar.\n\nNow you’ll have a one-click toggle button pinned above Explorer, always visible.\n\n## 3. Bonus Tweaks for Faster File Management\n\nWhile you’re tweaking, here are two other handy tricks:\n\n- **Assign a hotkey to File Explorer views**:\nRight-click File Explorer’s shortcut → Properties → Shortcut tab. In “Shortcut key,” set something like `Ctrl + Alt + E` for instant Explorer access.\n- **Enable file extensions quickly**:\nPress **Alt + V, F** in Explorer to toggle “File name extensions.” Another small but mighty shortcut.\n\nWith a few tweaks, you can take Windows’ hidden menus and toggles from annoying to empowering:\n\n- Restore the **classic context menu** for speed.\n- Use a keyboard shortcut or toolbar button to toggle **hidden items** instantly.\n- Layer on additional quick-access tweaks for file extensions, Explorer views, and more.\n\nThese changes don’t require third-party tools—just a little configuration. Once you set them up, everyday file management feels smoother and snappier.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-reconfigure-the-hidden-context-menu-and-unlock-power-tweaks-in-windows/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2581)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Top 10 Windows 11 Tips Every Beginner Should Know](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11starttoptips.webp?fit=708%2C726&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/top-10-windows-11-tips-every-beginner-should-know/)\n\n[![Moving from Office 2016/2019 to Microsoft 365: What Changes?](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/moving2019.webp?fit=724%2C701&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/moving-from-office-2016-2019-to-microsoft-365-what-changes/)\n\n[![Unlocking Hidden Superpowers in Windows 11 Speech, Eye, and Voice Access Tools You Didn’t Know You Had](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/win11-4.png?fit=713%2C614&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/unlocking-hidden-superpowers-in-windows-11-speech-eye-and-voice-access-tools-you-didnt-know-you-had/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
