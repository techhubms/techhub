With a redesigned interface, better performance insights, and more powerful controls, it has become a must-use tool for power users who want to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their system.\n\nIf you’ve been using Task Manager just to “end task” when apps freeze, you’re missing out on a lot. Here are some advanced Task Manager tips for Windows 11 power users.\n\n## 1. Quickly Launch Task Manager\n\nInstead of digging through menus, power users often rely on faster shortcuts:\n\n- **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** → Opens Task Manager directly.\n- **Ctrl + Alt + Delete → Task Manager** → Useful if Windows becomes unresponsive.\n- **Right-click on Taskbar → Task Manager** → A Windows 11 addition that restores the classic right-click shortcut.\n\n## 2. Use Efficiency Mode to Reduce Resource Usage\n\nWindows 11 introduces **Efficiency Mode**, letting you throttle background apps to save CPU cycles and battery life.\n\n- Right-click on a process → **Efficiency Mode**.\n- Great for apps that hog CPU but don’t need high performance (like background updaters).\n\n## 3. Analyze Process Dependencies\n\nBefore killing a process, check what’s linked to it:\n\n- Right-click a process → **Go to details**.\n- From the **Details tab**, you can see process IDs, priorities, and dependencies.\n- This prevents accidentally closing essential background services.\n\n## 4. Monitor GPU Usage and Per-App Performance\n\nGamers, video editors, and AI/ML users will love this:\n\n- In the **Performance tab**, check **GPU** usage, dedicated vs shared GPU memory, and real-time performance.\n- In the **Processes tab**, you can see **GPU utilization per process**, making it easier to spot apps that secretly use graphics power.\n\n## 5. Startup Impact Analysis\n\nInstead of disabling all startup programs blindly:\n\n- Open the **Startup apps tab**.\n- Look at the **Startup impact** rating (Low, Medium, High).\n- Disable only those with “High impact” to speed up boot times without breaking functionality.\n\n## 6. Resource Monitor Integration\n\nNeed deeper system insights?\n\n- From the **Performance tab**, click **Open Resource Monitor**.\n- This launches a more detailed breakdown of CPU, Disk, Network, and Memory activity.\n- Perfect for diagnosing bottlenecks or tracking down rogue apps.\n\n## 7. Set Process Priorities and Affinities\n\nFor performance tuning:\n\n- In the **Details tab**, right-click a process → **Set priority** (Real-time, High, Normal, Low).\n- Use **Set affinity** to limit a process to specific CPU cores.\n- Handy for dedicating cores to demanding apps (like rendering software) while leaving others free.\n\n## 8. Check Power Usage Trends\n\nWindows 11 Task Manager tracks **power usage per app**:\n\n- Columns **Power usage** and **Power usage trend** show which apps drain your battery over time.\n- Useful for laptop users balancing performance and battery life.\n\n## 9. Run New Tasks with Admin Rights\n\nWhen troubleshooting:\n\n- Go to **Run new task**.\n- Enter a command (e.g., `cmd`\n, `powershell` , or `explorer.exe` ).\n- Check **Create this task with administrative privileges** for elevated access.\n\n## 10. Dark Mode and Always-on Top\n\nFor better multitasking:\n\n- **Settings → Dark Mode** → Match system theme or reduce eye strain.\n- **Always on top** → Keep Task Manager visible while monitoring performance during stress tests or gaming.\n\nWindows 11 Task Manager is no longer just a “last resort” for frozen apps—it’s a powerful diagnostic and optimization tool. By mastering features like Efficiency Mode, GPU monitoring, and process priorities, power users can squeeze every bit of performance out of their systems.\n\nIf you haven’t explored beyond the default Processes tab, take a few minutes to experiment—you might discover optimizations that make your Windows 11 experience smoother and faster.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/advanced-task-manager-tips-for-power-users-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/advanced-task-manager-tips-for-power-users-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/advanced-task-manager-tips-for-power-users-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/advanced-task-manager-tips-for-power-users-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/advanced-task-manager-tips-for-power-users-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2434)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Advanced File Explorer Tips for Faster Navigation in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11navigation.webp?fit=750%2C742&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/advanced-file-explorer-tips-for-faster-navigation-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Registry Tweaks to Unlock Hidden Features in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/win11hiddenfeatures.webp?fit=770%2C779&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/registry-tweaks-to-unlock-hidden-features-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![Setting Up Windows Hello for Faster Logins in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wind11hello.webp?fit=690%2C701&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/setting-up-windows-hello-for-faster-logins-in-windows-11/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
