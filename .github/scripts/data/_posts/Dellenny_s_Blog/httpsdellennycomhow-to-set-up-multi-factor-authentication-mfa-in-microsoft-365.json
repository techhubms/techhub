MFA adds an extra layer of security to your Microsoft 365 account by requiring users to verify their identity through more than just a password—such as a text message, phone call, or authentication app.\n\nIn this post, we’ll walk through the steps to enable and set up MFA in Microsoft 365 for improved security.\n\n## What is MFA and Why Use It?\n\n**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** requires users to present two or more verification factors when signing in. Typically, this includes:\n\n- Something you know (password)\n- Something you have (mobile device, authentication app)\n- Something you are (biometrics like fingerprint or face recognition)\n\nWith MFA enabled, even if a password is compromised, unauthorized users can’t access the account without the second verification method. This dramatically reduces the risk of account breaches.\n\n## Step 1: Sign in to Microsoft 365 Admin Center\n\n1. Go to the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**: https://admin.microsoft.com.\n2. Sign in with your **Global Administrator** account.\n\n## Step 2: Enable MFA for Users\n\n1. In the left-hand menu, go to **Users &gt; Active users**.\n2. At the top, select **Multi-factor authentication**.\n- This opens a new MFA management page.\n3. You’ll see a list of users and their MFA status (Enabled, Enforced, or Disabled).\n4. Select the user(s) you want to enable MFA for.\n5. On the right-hand panel, click **Enable**.\n6. Confirm your changes.\n\n## Step 3: User Setup Process\n\nOnce MFA is enabled by the administrator, users will need to configure it during their next sign-in:\n\n1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 with your usual username and password.\n2. You’ll be prompted to set up **additional security verification**.\n3. Choose your preferred method:\n- **Microsoft Authenticator app** (recommended for ease of use).\n- **Text message** (verification code sent to your phone).\n- **Phone call** (receive an automated call to verify).\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup.\n\n## Step 4: Testing MFA\n\n1. Log out and sign back in to your Microsoft 365 account.\n2. After entering your password, you should be asked for the second verification factor (e.g., a code from the Authenticator app).\n3. Confirm access, and you’re in!\n\n## Best Practices for MFA in Microsoft 365\n\n- **Use the Microsoft Authenticator app**: It’s more secure than SMS.\n- **Enable MFA for all users**, especially admins, executives, and anyone with access to sensitive data.\n- **Consider Conditional Access Policies**: With Azure AD Premium, you can set conditions (e.g., requiring MFA only when signing in from outside the corporate network).\n- **Educate users**: Provide guidance on how to set up MFA and what to expect during login.\n\nEnabling Multi-Factor Authentication in Microsoft 365 is one of the **simplest and most effective ways** to protect your organization’s data. It drastically reduces the risk of account breaches and strengthens your overall security posture.\n\nIf you haven’t already enabled MFA in your environment, make it a priority today—you’ll thank yourself later.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-in-microsoft-365/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-in-microsoft-365/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-in-microsoft-365/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-in-microsoft-365/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-set-up-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-in-microsoft-365/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2407)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Branding Your SharePoint Site for Your Organization](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sharepoint.webp?fit=738%2C603&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/branding-your-sharepoint-site-for-your-organization/)\n\n[![Understanding Microsoft 365 Compliance Center Basics](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/m365compliancecenter.webp?fit=766%2C761&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/understanding-microsoft-365-compliance-center-basics/)\n\n[![Save Hours Every Week with Power Automate Workflows in Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/powerautomate365.webp?fit=774%2C776&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/save-hours-every-week-with-power-automate-workflows-in-microsoft-365/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
