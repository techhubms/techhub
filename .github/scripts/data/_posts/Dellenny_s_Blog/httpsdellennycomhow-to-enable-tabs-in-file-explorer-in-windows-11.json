For years, Windows users requested a tabbed interface that would allow multiple folders to stay open in a single window. Fortunately, Microsoft finally introduced **tabs in File Explorer** in Windows 11, making file management smoother, cleaner, and far more efficient.\n\nHowever, depending on your version of Windows 11, you may not see the tabs feature right away. Some users only get it after certain cumulative updates, while others may need to enable it manually or verify whether they are running the correct Windows build.\n\nIn this detailed, beginner-friendly guide, you’ll learn **exactly how to enable tabs in File Explorer in Windows 11**, how to check your system compatibility, and what to do if the feature isn’t showing up.\n\nLet’s get started.\n\n## **What Are Tabs in File Explorer?**\n\nTabs in File Explorer allow you to open multiple folders inside a single window, just like using multiple tabs in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. For example, you can have one tab open for “Documents,” another for “Downloads,” and a third for “Pictures,” all in one convenient interface.\n\nThis eliminates window clutter and makes switching between locations faster and easier.\n\n### **Key Benefits of File Explorer Tabs**\n\n- **Cleaner workspace:** No more juggling several overlapping Explorer windows.\n- **Improved workflow:** Quickly switch between folders with a single click.\n- **Time-saving:** Copy and move files between tabs without opening new windows.\n- **Modern interface:** Makes Windows feel more intuitive and user-friendly.\n\n## **Step 1: Check Your Windows 11 Version**\n\nBefore you can enable File Explorer tabs, you must ensure your device is running **Windows 11 22H2 or later**, because the tabbed File Explorer feature was introduced starting with the 22H2 update.\n\n### **How to Check Your Windows Version**\n\n1. Press **Windows Key + R** to open the Run dialog.\n2. Type **winver** and press Enter.\n3. A window will appear showing your Windows version and build number.\n\nYou should see something like:\n\n- **Version:** 22H2\n- **OS Build:** 22621.xxx or higher\n\nIf you’re running Windows 11 **21H2**, the tabs feature won’t appear until you update.\n\n## **Step 2: Update Windows 11 to the Latest Version**\n\nIf your PC isn’t currently updated, you’ll need to install the latest cumulative updates to enable File Explorer tabs automatically.\n\n### **How to Update Windows 11**\n\n1. Click **Start** and open **Settings**.\n2. Go to **Windows Update** on the left sidebar.\n3. Click **Check for updates**.\n4. Download and install all available updates.\n5. Restart your PC if prompted.\n\nAfter updating, File Explorer tabs should appear automatically when you open a new window. If not, continue reading for additional solutions.\n\n## **Step 3: Confirm Tabs Are Enabled in File Explorer**\n\nOnce your system is updated, enabling tabs is usually automatic—there’s no toggle in the Settings app to turn it on manually. To check whether it’s active:\n\n### **Test If Tabs Are Working**\n\n1. Open **File Explorer**.\n2. Look at the top of the window.\n3. You should see a **plus (+)** button next to the existing tab.\n4. Clicking the + opens a new tab.\n\nIf you see the tab bar, congratulations—you’re all set!\n\nBut what if you don’t see tabs yet? Let’s troubleshoot.\n\n## **Step 4: Fix File Explorer Tabs Not Showing in Windows 11**\n\nIf File Explorer tabs still aren’t available on your device after updating, there are a few common reasons:\n\n### **1. Your Windows Build Is Outdated**\n\nYou must have build 22621 or newer. Re-check using `winver` .\n\n### **2. You Are Using Windows 11 Home or Pro Without Updates**\n\nSome users paused updates or delayed them unknowingly.\n\n### **3. Group Policies or Registry Tweaks Disabled the Feature**\n\nCorporate or school-issued devices often block UI changes.\n\n### **4. Windows Explorer Needs to Be Restarted**\n\nSometimes a simple restart activates the new interface.\n\n## **Restart Windows Explorer (Quick Fix)**\n\nRestarting the File Explorer process often triggers the new tabs UI.\n\n### **How to Restart Windows Explorer**\n\n1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open Task Manager.\n2. Click **Processes**.\n3. Scroll to **Windows Explorer**.\n4. Right-click it and select **Restart**.\n\nYour screen may blink, and the taskbar will reload. Open File Explorer again to check whether tabs now show.\n\n## **Optional: Enable Tabs Using ViveTool (Advanced Users)**\n\nIf you’re comfortable using the command line, you can manually enable hidden features using **ViveTool**, a well-known utility for Windows feature activation. This step is only recommended for advanced users.\n\n### **How to Enable Tabs with ViveTool**\n\n1. Download ViveTool from the official GitHub page.\n2. Extract the folder.\n3. Open **Command Prompt as Administrator**.\n4. Navigate to the ViveTool folder using the `cd`\ncommand.\n5. Run this command: `vivetool /enable /id:37634385`\n6. Restart your PC.\n\nOnce your device restarts, open File Explorer and tabs should appear.\n\n## **How to Use Tabs in File Explorer Effectively**\n\nNow that the tabs feature is enabled, here are some productivity tips:\n\n### **Open a New Tab**\n\nClick the **+** icon OR Press **Ctrl + T** (similar to browser shortcuts)\n\n### **Close a Tab**\n\nClick the **X** on the tab OR Press **Ctrl + W**\n\n### **Switch Between Tabs**\n\nUse your mouse OR Press **Ctrl + Tab**\n\n### **Move Files Between Tabs**\n\nDrag and drop files from one tab into another. This makes organizing folders dramatically easier.\n\n## **Why Tabs Are a Game-Changer for Windows 11 Users**\n\nTabbed File Explorer finally brings Windows in line with modern UI expectations. Whether you’re a student, office worker, content creator, or power user, this feature reduces clutter, improves productivity, and simplifies everyday tasks.\n\nManaging dozens of folders is now as easy as managing browser tabs—and once you get used to it, there’s no going back.\n\nEnabling tabs in File Explorer on Windows 11 is one of the simplest ways to improve your daily workflow. As long as your system is updated to version 22H2 or later, the feature should appear automatically. And even if it doesn’t show at first, the steps above will help you troubleshoot and activate it quickly.\n\nTabbed navigation makes Windows feel cleaner, faster, and more modern—so take advantage of it and enjoy a more organized desktop experience.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-tabs-in-file-explorer-in-windows-11/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-tabs-in-file-explorer-in-windows-11/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-tabs-in-file-explorer-in-windows-11/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-tabs-in-file-explorer-in-windows-11/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-tabs-in-file-explorer-in-windows-11/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3517)\n\nTags:[Windows 11](https://dellenny.com/tag/windows-11/ \"Windows 11\")\n\n[previousPractical Use Cases Writing, Refactoring, and Testing Code with GitHub Copilot](https://dellenny.com/practical-use-cases-writing-refactoring-and-testing-code-with-github-copilot/)\n\n[nextHow to Map Network Drives in Windows 11: A Complete Step-by-Step Guide](https://dellenny.com/how-to-map-network-drives-in-windows-11-a-complete-step-by-step-guide/)\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=3517)\n\n%d",
