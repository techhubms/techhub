With the introduction of **Copilot in Microsoft 365**, users can now generate formulas, automate workflows, and analyze data with natural language commands. Instead of struggling to remember complex syntax or nested functions, Copilot acts as your intelligent assistant—interpreting your requests and building formulas for you.\n\nWhether you’re a beginner who always forgets how VLOOKUP works or a power user wanting to prototype formulas faster, Copilot offers an intuitive way to work smarter in Excel. In this guide, we’ll walk through **how to generate formulas using Copilot in Excel**, step-by-step, along with examples and tips on getting the best results.\n\n## **How to Access Copilot in Excel**\n\nBefore you can start generating formulas, you need to confirm that Copilot is enabled in your Excel app. You can use Copilot in:\n\n- Excel for Web\n- Excel Desktop (Microsoft 365 Enterprise or Business plans with Copilot subscription)\n\nOnce Copilot is available, you’ll see a **Copilot icon** (usually on the ribbon toolbar). Clicking it opens a panel where you can enter instructions.\n\n## **Generating Formulas with Natural Language Prompts**\n\nThe magic of Copilot lies in being able to write requests like:\n\n>\n> “Calculate the total revenue by multiplying quantity and price.”\n>\n\nCopilot then writes and inserts the appropriate formula.\n\n### **Step-by-Step: How to Generate a Formula**\n\n#### **Step 1: Select a Cell**\n\nChoose where you want the formula to appear. Copilot often works better when the correct column is selected before giving instructions.\n\n#### **Step 2: Open Copilot**\n\nClick the Copilot icon to open the prompt window.\n\n#### **Step 3: Describe What You Want**\n\nWrite a natural language request such as:\n\n- “Calculate the profit by subtracting cost from revenue.”\n- “Show the average of column C.”\n- “Find the highest score in this dataset.”\n\n#### **Step 4: Insert the Formula**\n\nCopilot generates the formula and gives you the option to insert it directly into Excel.\n\n## **Examples of Using Copilot for Common Excel Formulas**\n\nHere are several real-world scenarios showing how Copilot can help.\n\n### **1. SUM and Basic Arithmetic**\n\nInstead of writing:\n\n``` =SUM(B2:B50)\n\n```\n\nYou can simply ask:\n\n>\n> “Add up all values in the Quantity column.”\n>\n\nCopilot identifies the correct column and generates the formula for you.\n\n### **2. Calculating Totals with Multiple Columns**\n\nIf your worksheet has a Price and Quantity column, ask:\n\n>\n> “Calculate total sales as price multiplied by quantity.”\n>\n\nCopilot produces a formula like:\n\n``` =[@[Price]]*[@[Quantity]]\n\n```\n\nOr, depending on the format, a cell reference version such as:\n\n``` =B2*C2\n\n```\n\n### **3. AVERAGE, MAX, MIN**\n\nInstead of searching Excel’s function list, ask:\n\n- “Show the highest revenue figure.”\n- “Give me the average delivery time.”\n\nCopilot writes the correct functions like `MAX()` , `AVERAGE()` , or `MIN()` .\n\n### **4. Text Formulas**\n\nCopilot can help with string manipulation:\n\n>\n> “Combine first and last name into one cell with a space.”\n>\n\nIt may output:\n\n``` =CONCATENATE(A2, \" \", B2)\n\n```\n\nOr the modern version:\n\n``` =TEXTJOIN(\" \", TRUE, A2, B2) ```\n\n### **5. IF Statements**\n\nComplex conditional formulas become much easier. Instead of manually writing:\n\n``` =IF(C2 > 70, \"Pass\", \"Fail\")\n\n```\n\nJust ask:\n\n>\n> “Mark the student as Pass if their score is above 70, otherwise Fail.”\n>\n\nCopilot generates the correct formula automatically.\n\n### **6. VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP**\n\nLookups are one of the hardest formula types for users to remember, but Copilot simplifies them.\n\nPrompt:\n\n>\n> “Look up the customer ID in column A and return the matching name from column B.”\n>\n\nCopilot may create:\n\n``` =XLOOKUP(A2, A:A, B:B)\n\n```\n\nOr a VLOOKUP version depending on your settings.\n\n## **Tips for Writing Effective Prompts**\n\nCopilot is powerful, but you can improve accuracy by giving more context. Here are helpful tips:\n\n### ✔ Be Specific\n\nInstead of:\n\n>\n> “Calculate profit”\n>\n\nTry:\n\n>\n> “Calculate profit in column F by subtracting cost in column D from revenue in column E.”\n>\n\n### ✔ Reference Column Headers\n\nCopilot can detect column names, so mentioning them helps.\n\n### ✔ Start with Small Requests\n\nIf you’re transforming large datasets, break requests into clear, manageable tasks.\n\n### ✔ Review the Formula Copilot Writes\n\nAlways double-check logic before inserting it, especially in business-critical worksheets.\n\n## **Using Copilot to Learn Excel Formulas**\n\nCopilot is not only a productivity tool—it’s also a learning tool. If you’re unsure how a formula works, ask:\n\n>\n> “Explain the formula you just created.”\n>\n\nCopilot can walk you through:\n\n- What each part of the formula does\n- Why it chose the function\n- Alternative formulas you could use\n\nOver time, this can help new users become more confident with Excel.\n\n## **Advanced Use: Data Cleaning**\n\nCopilot can also generate formulas for data preparation:\n\n- Removing duplicates\n- Extracting text\n- Standardizing formats\n- Splitting data into multiple columns\n\nFor example:\n\n>\n> “Extract the last four digits of the phone number.”\n>\n\nCopilot may write:\n\n``` =RIGHT(A2, 4)\n\n```\n\nOr:\n\n>\n> “Convert all names to proper case.”\n>\n\nCopilot could suggest:\n\n``` =PROPER(A2)\n\n```\n\n## **Why Use Copilot for Formula Generation?**\n\n### **1. Saves Time**\n\nYou don’t need to manually build or remember formulas.\n\n### **2. Reduces Errors**\n\nCopilot writes correct syntax with consistent formatting.\n\n### **3. Makes Excel Easier**\n\nNew users can work faster without memorizing functions.\n\n### **4. Boosts Productivity**\n\nWorkflows that took 20 minutes now take seconds.\n\n### **5. Teaches Along the Way**\n\nCopilot acts like a built-in tutor.\n\nAI is reshaping how we use spreadsheets, and Copilot in Excel is one of the biggest productivity boosts the platform has ever seen. By turning natural language into functioning formulas, Copilot makes data analysis faster, simpler, and more accessible for everyone—from beginners to experts.\n\nWhether you’re handling financial reports, business data, academic sheets, or everyday tasks, learning **how to generate formulas using Copilot in Excel** can significantly improve your workflow and reduce errors while empowering you to get more done.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Facebook](https://dellenny.com/how-to-generate-formulas-using-copilot-in-excel/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window) X](https://dellenny.com/how-to-generate-formulas-using-copilot-in-excel/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) LinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/how-to-generate-formulas-using-copilot-in-excel/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window) Telegram](https://dellenny.com/how-to-generate-formulas-using-copilot-in-excel/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) WhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/how-to-generate-formulas-using-copilot-in-excel/?share=jetpack-whatsapp)\n-\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nTags:[M365 Copilot](https://dellenny.com/tag/m365-copilot/ \"M365 Copilot\")\n\n[previousAnalyzing Sales Data with Simple Natural Language Prompts in Copilot Excel](https://dellenny.com/analyzing-sales-data-with-simple-natural-language-prompts-in-copilot-excel/)\n\n## Leave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.
