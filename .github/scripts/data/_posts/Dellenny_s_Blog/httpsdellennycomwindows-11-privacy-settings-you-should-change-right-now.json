  "EnhancedContent": "Skip to content\n\nWindows 11 is sleek, fast, and full of features‚Äîbut like most modern operating systems, it collects a lot of data about how you use your device. By default, Microsoft enables several settings that send diagnostic information, personalize ads, and track your activity across devices.\n\nIf you value your privacy, it‚Äôs worth taking a few minutes to adjust these settings. Here are the **most important Windows 11 privacy settings you should change right now**.\n\n## 1. Turn Off Advertising ID Tracking\n\nWindows 11 assigns an **advertising ID** that helps apps show you personalized ads. While it doesn‚Äôt expose your personal identity, it still tracks how you use apps and the web.\n\n- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí General**\n- Toggle off: **‚ÄúLet apps show me personalized ads by using my advertising ID.‚Äù**\n\n## 2. Limit Diagnostic Data Collection\n\nMicrosoft collects diagnostic data to improve Windows, but you can limit how much is sent.\n\n- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Diagnostics & Feedback**\n- Select **‚ÄúRequired diagnostic data‚Äù** instead of ‚ÄúOptional diagnostic data.‚Äù\n- Scroll down and turn off **‚ÄúTailored experiences.‚Äù**\n\n## 3. Disable Location Tracking (Unless You Really Need It)\n\nLocation services are useful for maps or weather apps, but not everyone wants constant tracking.\n\n- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Location**\n- Toggle off **Location services** or disable location access for specific apps.\n\n## 4. Manage App Permissions\n\nMany apps request access to your **camera, microphone, contacts, and more**‚Äîeven if they don‚Äôt need it.\n\n- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí App permissions**\n- Review each category (Camera, Microphone, Contacts, etc.) and turn off access for apps that shouldn‚Äôt have it.\n\n## 5. Stop Windows From Tracking Your Typing & Inking\n\nWindows can collect typing and handwriting data to improve text suggestions. If that feels intrusive:\n\n- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Inking & Typing personalization**\n- Toggle off **‚ÄúPersonal inking and typing dictionary.‚Äù**\n\n## 6. Disable Activity History Syncing\n\nWindows can save your activity history (apps, websites, documents) and sync it across devices.\n\n- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Activity History**\n- Uncheck **‚ÄúStore my activity history on this device‚Äù** and **‚ÄúSend my activity history to Microsoft.‚Äù**\n\n## 7. Control Background Apps\n\nBackground apps can consume resources and quietly send data.\n\n- Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Installed apps**\n- For each app, click the three dots ‚Üí **Advanced options**\n- Under ‚ÄúBackground apps permissions,‚Äù choose **Never** for apps you don‚Äôt need running in the background.\n\nüí° **Pro tip:** Revisit these settings after major Windows updates‚Äîsometimes Microsoft resets preferences back to defaults.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-privacy-settings-you-should-change-right-now/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-privacy-settings-you-should-change-right-now/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-privacy-settings-you-should-change-right-now/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-privacy-settings-you-should-change-right-now/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/windows-11-privacy-settings-you-should-change-right-now/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2669)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Creating Custom Themes &amp; Wallpapers in Windows 11](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11Themes.webp?fit=715%2C696&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/creating-custom-themes-wallpapers-in-windows-11/)\n\n[![How to Enable and Personalize Dark Mode on any device](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/darkmode.webp?fit=724%2C687&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-enable-and-personalize-dark-mode-on-any-device/)\n\n[![How to Personalize Your Windows 11 Desktop Like a Pro](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/win11Customization.webp?fit=714%2C717&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-personalize-your-windows-11-desktop-like-a-pro/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
