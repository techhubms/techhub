But with that convenience comes risk. Cybercriminals know how much sensitive data flows through M365, making it a prime target for phishing, ransomware, and data theft.\n\nThe good news? You don’t need to be in IT to play a big role in keeping your organization secure. Here’s what every non-technical team member should know.\n\n## 1. Strong Passwords + Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Are Non-Negotiable\n\n- Use unique, complex passwords—avoid reusing the same one across accounts.\n- Enable **MFA** (that quick code sent to your phone or app). It stops attackers even if they steal your password.\n- Think of MFA as locking your front door and adding a deadbolt.\n\n## 2. Recognize Phishing Attempts\n\nMost breaches start with a **suspicious email**. Red flags to look for:\n\n- Urgent requests for passwords or money transfers.\n- Links that look “off” (hover to preview before clicking).\n- Attachments from unknown senders.\n\nIf something feels odd—don’t click. Report it instead.\n\n## 3. Keep Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive Clean\n\n- Only share files with people who actually need them.\n- Use **permissions** instead of sending files as email attachments.\n- Regularly review shared folders to avoid “over-sharing.”\n\nGood housekeeping reduces the chance of accidental leaks.\n\n## 4. Watch What You Share in Chats & Meetings\n\nIt’s easy to drop confidential information into a Teams chat, but remember:\n\n- Chats can be exported, copied, or screenshotted.\n- Sensitive data (like client details or financials) should only be shared in secure, approved channels.\n\n## 5. Keep Devices Updated\n\nWhether you’re on a laptop, tablet, or phone:\n\n- Always install updates when prompted.\n- Updates patch security holes hackers try to exploit.\n- Avoid using personal devices for work unless they’re approved and secured.\n\n## 6. Report Suspicious Activity—Fast\n\nIf you see something unusual (e.g., unexpected login alerts, missing files, or strange account activity), tell IT immediately. Quick action can stop a small issue from becoming a big breach.\n\n## Why It Matters for Non-IT Teams\n\nCybersecurity isn’t just “an IT thing.” Everyone in the organization is a gatekeeper to sensitive data. By following these simple steps, non-IT teams help protect:\n\n- Customer trust\n- Company reputation\n- Daily productivity\n\n✅ **Takeaway:** Microsoft 365 security is strongest when everyone plays a role. Even small habits—like using MFA or spotting a phishing email—make a huge difference.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-security-made-simple-what-non-it-teams-must-know/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-security-made-simple-what-non-it-teams-must-know/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-security-made-simple-what-non-it-teams-must-know/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-security-made-simple-what-non-it-teams-must-know/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/microsoft-365-security-made-simple-what-non-it-teams-must-know/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2647)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Transforming Remote Healthcare Collaboration with Microsoft 365](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365healthcare.webp?fit=698%2C678&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/transforming-remote-healthcare-collaboration-with-microsoft-365/)\n\n[![Using Microsoft 365 for Law Firms and Compliance-Heavy Industries](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/m365law.webp?fit=719%2C726&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/using-microsoft-365-for-law-firms-and-compliance-heavy-industries/)\n\n[![How to Fix Common OneNote Issues A Complete Troubleshooting Guide](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/onnoteissues.webp?fit=713%2C718&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/how-to-fix-common-onenote-issues-a-complete-troubleshooting-guide/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
