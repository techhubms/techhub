But running large test suites locally or in CI can be slow, flaky, and resource-hungry. That’s where **Azure Playwright Testing (Preview)** — also called *Microsoft Playwright Testing* — comes in.\n\nThis walkthrough will show you how to go from a plain Playwright project to running tests at scale in the Azure cloud, complete with reporting, debugging, and parallel execution.\n\n## What is Azure Playwright Testing?\n\nAzure Playwright Testing is a managed cloud service built on top of Playwright. It takes care of the infrastructure — scaling browsers, balancing workloads, storing artifacts — so you can focus on writing tests. Key benefits include:\n\n- Run Playwright tests in the cloud with high parallelism.\n- Access multiple operating systems and browsers without managing environments.\n- Capture and view traces, screenshots, logs, and videos in a dedicated portal.\n- Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines for automated quality checks.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore diving in, make sure you have:\n\n- An Azure account with an active subscription.\n- Azure CLI installed locally or in your CI runner.\n- A Playwright project set up with tests (`@playwright/test`\nfor Node.js).\n\n## Step 1: Create a Workspace in Azure\n\nIn the Azure portal, create a **Playwright Testing workspace**.\n\n- Give it a unique name.\n- Choose a subscription and region.\n- Once created, note the **region-specific endpoint URL** — you’ll need it later.\n\nThis workspace is your team’s entry point to the service.\n\n## Step 2: Add the Service Package to Your Project\n\nIn your Playwright project, run:\n\n``` npm init @azure/microsoft-playwright-testing@latest\n\n```\n\nThis sets up a `playwright.service.config.ts` file, which links your tests to Azure.\n\n## Step 3: Configure the Endpoint\n\nSet the workspace endpoint URL as an environment variable. For example, in a `.env` file:\n\n``` PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL=wss://<region>.api.playwright.microsoft.com/accounts/<workspace-id>/browsers ```\n\n## Step 4: Authenticate\n\nYou have two main options:\n\n- **Azure Entra ID (recommended)**: Sign in with `az login`\n, and your CLI credentials will be used.\n- **Access Tokens**: Generate a token in the portal, then export it as an environment variable.\n\nFor local development and CI pipelines, Entra ID is typically easier and more secure.\n\n## Step 5: Tune the Service Configuration\n\nThe generated `playwright.service.config.ts` can be customized. Example:\n\n``` import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test'; import { getServiceConfig, ServiceOS } from '@azure/microsoft-playwright-testing'; import { AzureCliCredential } from '@azure/identity'; import baseConfig from './playwright.config';\n\nexport default defineConfig( baseConfig, getServiceConfig(baseConfig, { serviceAuthType: 'ENTRA_ID', os: ServiceOS.LINUX, useCloudHostedBrowsers: true, exposeNetwork: '<loopback>', timeout: 30000, credential: new AzureCliCredential(), }), { reporter: [ ['list'], ['@azure/microsoft-playwright-testing/reporter', { enableGitHubSummary: true }], ], } );\n\n```\n\nHere you can specify the OS, authentication type, timeouts, and reporters.\n\n## Step 6: Enable Artifacts\n\nConfigure Playwright to capture artifacts like traces, videos, and screenshots:\n\n``` use: { trace: 'on-first-retry', video: 'retain-on-failure', screenshot: 'on', }\n\n```\n\nThese will show up in the Azure Playwright Testing portal after runs.\n\n## Step 7: Run Tests in the Cloud\n\nRun your tests through the service:\n\n``` npx playwright test --config=playwright.service.config.ts --workers=20\n\n```\n\nYour results will appear in the console and in the portal with detailed logs and artifacts.\n\n## Step 8: Automate in CI/CD\n\nIn GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, or your CI system of choice:\n\n1. Set environment variables (`PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL`\n, and optionally authentication tokens).\n2. Log in to Azure with federated identity or service principal.\n3. Run tests just like locally, but at cloud scale.\n\nThis ensures every pull request gets validated by real browser tests.\n\n## Step 9: Optimize & Debug\n\n- Adjust parallel workers for speed vs. resource usage.\n- Use the portal to debug failing tests with traces and logs.\n- Toggle features like cloud-hosted browsers or reporting in your config.\n\nWith Azure Playwright Testing, you can scale your end-to-end test suites, speed up feedback cycles, and gain rich debugging capabilities — all without managing browser infrastructure yourself.\n\nEven though the service is currently in preview, it’s a powerful way to supercharge Playwright testing and integrate cloud-scale confidence into your development workflow.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/end-to-end-confidence-in-the-cloud-a-walkthrough-of-azure-playwright-testing-preview/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/end-to-end-confidence-in-the-cloud-a-walkthrough-of-azure-playwright-testing-preview/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/end-to-end-confidence-in-the-cloud-a-walkthrough-of-azure-playwright-testing-preview/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/end-to-end-confidence-in-the-cloud-a-walkthrough-of-azure-playwright-testing-preview/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/end-to-end-confidence-in-the-cloud-a-walkthrough-of-azure-playwright-testing-preview/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2711)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![Getting Started with Microsoft Playwright Testing Features and How to Use It](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/playright1.webp?fit=718%2C716&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/getting-started-with-microsoft-playwright-testing-features-and-how-to-use-it/)\n\n[![Exporting Confluence Content with the REST API and API Tokens](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/remotedesktopapp.png?fit=699%2C679&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/exporting-confluence-content-with-the-rest-api-and-api-tokens/)\n\n[![Getting Started with Power Automate A Beginner’s Guide](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/videoediting.png?fit=711%2C708&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/getting-started-with-power-automate-a-beginners-guide/)\n\nScroll to Top\n\n%d",
