But recently, GitHub introduced a new feature that‚Äôs changing how Copilot works with you: **memory**.\n\nLet‚Äôs break down what Copilot‚Äôs memory is, why it matters, and how you can control it.\n\n## üß† What Is Copilot‚Äôs Memory?\n\nIn simple terms, **Copilot‚Äôs memory lets it remember facts about you and your coding preferences across different sessions and projects**. It goes beyond just reacting to your current file ‚Äî now, it can retain important context you‚Äôve shared before, like:\n\n- Your name or preferred coding style\n- Frameworks or libraries you frequently use\n- Projects you‚Äôve worked on\n- Repositories you often contribute to\n\nThis persistent memory helps Copilot give you **more personalized and consistent suggestions** over time.\n\n## üîÑ Memory vs. Context\n\nYou might wonder, *‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Copilot already use my code context?‚Äù* Yes, it does ‚Äî but that‚Äôs **short-term memory**, limited to the current file or repo.\n\n**Memory**, on the other hand, is **long-term**. It persists even after you close your IDE or switch projects. Think of it as the difference between remembering what you‚Äôre doing *right now* versus remembering your general preferences and habits.\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è What Can Copilot Remember?\n\nCopilot‚Äôs memory isn‚Äôt a black box. It might remember:\n\n- That you prefer React with TypeScript\n- Your naming conventions (e.g., snake\\_case vs. camelCase)\n- Common patterns you use (e.g., always using async/await)\n- Your favorite tools or APIs\n\nAs of now, the memory is primarily used to **improve code completions**, making them feel more tailored and relevant to you.\n\n## üß© How Is Memory Managed?\n\nGitHub gives you **full control** over your Copilot memory:\n\n- ‚úÖ You can **see what‚Äôs stored** in your memory\n- üßπ You can **delete individual items** or **clear all memory**\n- üîí Your memory is tied to your GitHub account and is private\n\nTo manage your memory, go to your [Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot) on GitHub and look for the **‚ÄúMemory‚Äù** section.\n\n## üîê What About Privacy?\n\nGitHub has emphasized that memory is **user-controlled and transparent**. You‚Äôll be notified when Copilot adds a new item to your memory, and you can remove anything at any time.\n\nIt‚Äôs not about surveillance ‚Äî it‚Äôs about giving Copilot a way to remember the helpful bits that make coding with it smoother and more intuitive.\n\n## üöÄ Why Memory Matters\n\nCopilot with memory moves closer to being a real coding assistant ‚Äî one that knows your style, adapts to your habits, and evolves with your projects. Instead of starting from scratch every time, it builds a relationship with *you*, the developer.\n\nThink of it as the difference between pair programming with a stranger versus someone who knows your quirks and preferences.\n\nGitHub Copilot‚Äôs memory is still evolving, but it‚Äôs a powerful step toward making AI-assisted development more personalized, efficient, and human-friendly. If you‚Äôre a frequent user, it‚Äôs worth exploring how memory can improve your workflow ‚Äî and how you can shape it to work best for you.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/copilot-now-remembers-you-heres-why-that-matters/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/copilot-now-remembers-you-heres-why-that-matters/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/copilot-now-remembers-you-heres-why-that-matters/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/copilot-now-remembers-you-heres-why-that-matters/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/copilot-now-remembers-you-heres-why-that-matters/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2150)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![What Is Microsoft Copilot Studio?
