The key to unlocking the value of that data is integration. Enter **Microsoft Fabric**, an end-to-end analytics platform that simplifies and unifies data integration, engineering, and analysis—all in one environment.\n\nIn this blog, we’ll dive into what data integration means within Microsoft Fabric, explore its core capabilities, and walk through how you can leverage it to streamline your data pipelines and accelerate decision-making.\n\n## What is Microsoft Fabric?\n\nMicrosoft Fabric is a unified analytics platform that brings together various data tools such as **Data Factory**, **Synapse Data Engineering**, **Power BI**, and **Data Activator**, under a single Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) umbrella. At the heart of this integration lies **OneLake**—a single, unified data lake that acts as the foundation for all services in Fabric.\n\nWith Fabric, you no longer need to juggle multiple services and data stores. Everything—from ingestion and transformation to analytics and visualization—happens within one seamless ecosystem.\n\n## Why Data Integration Matters\n\nBefore you can analyze or visualize your data, it needs to be:\n\n- **Collected** from various sources (databases, APIs, SaaS apps, etc.)\n- **Cleansed** and **transformed** to fit your analytical models\n- **Centralized** in a consistent, accessible format\n\nWithout proper integration, your data remains fragmented, difficult to trust, and nearly impossible to use efficiently. Fabric addresses these challenges head-on.\n\n## Key Data Integration Capabilities in Microsoft Fabric\n\n### 1. **Dataflows Gen2**\n\nFabric’s **Dataflows Gen2** offers a low-code/no-code way to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data using Power Query. Key benefits include:\n\n- Built-in support for **hundreds of connectors** (SQL, Salesforce, Azure, SharePoint, etc.)\n- Reusable transformation logic using **Power Query M**\n- Seamless scheduling and orchestration\n\nDataflows store data in **OneLake** in a Delta Lake format, making it immediately usable across all Fabric services.\n\n### 2. **Data Factory in Fabric**\n\nFabric integrates a streamlined version of **Azure Data Factory**, providing:\n\n- **Data pipelines** for orchestrating complex data movement\n- **Copy activity** to move data between sources and sinks\n- Support for **mapping data flows** to visually design transformation logic\n\nYou can schedule and monitor pipelines within the Fabric UI, enabling end-to-end visibility into your data integration workflows.\n\n### 3. **Real-time Data Movement**\n\nUsing **Event Streams** and **Data Activator**, Fabric supports **real-time ingestion** and **event-driven data integration**, making it suitable for:\n\n- IoT scenarios\n- Streaming social media analytics\n- Real-time dashboards\n\nThis ensures your data pipelines aren’t just batch-oriented—they can also handle live data feeds.\n\n## The Role of OneLake\n\nAll integrated data in Fabric lands in **OneLake**, which acts as a single source of truth. OneLake:\n\n- Uses **Delta Lake** as its native format\n- Is **automatically accessible** by all Fabric workloads (e.g., Notebooks, Power BI)\n- Supports **shortcuts** to external data lakes like Amazon S3 or Azure Data Lake\n\nThis eliminates the need for multiple data copies or complex integrations.\n\n## Use Case: Integrating Sales and Marketing Data\n\nLet’s say you’re a retail company with:\n\n- Sales data in an on-premises SQL Server\n- Customer engagement data in Dynamics 365\n- Web traffic data from Google Analytics\n\nWith Microsoft Fabric, you can:\n\n1. Use **Dataflows Gen2** to pull in and transform SQL Server and Dynamics data.\n2. Connect to Google Analytics via a built-in connector.\n3. Store all of it in **OneLake** with consistent schema.\n4. Use **Power BI** to build a unified dashboard showing customer journeys from acquisition to purchase.\n\nAll this—without writing a line of complex code or leaving the Fabric UI.\n\n## Benefits of Data Integration in Microsoft Fabric\n\n- **Unified experience**: All services work together by design.\n- **Reduced complexity**: Less need for external ETL tools or data lakes.\n- **Governance and security**: Built-in data lineage, sensitivity labels, and Microsoft Purview integration.\n- **Scalability**: Leverage the performance of Azure under the hood.\n- **Collaboration**: Data engineers, analysts, and business users work in one platform.\n\nMicrosoft Fabric is more than just a data tool—it’s a **data unification platform**. Its data integration features make it easier than ever to connect, clean, and centralize data from anywhere. Whether you’re a data engineer building pipelines or a business analyst visualizing KPIs, Fabric provides a powerful, intuitive environment to get insights faster.\n\nAs data complexity continues to grow, embracing platforms like Fabric will be critical to staying agile, data-driven, and competitive.\n\n### Share this:\n\n- [Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook](https://dellenny.com/data-integration-with-microsoft-fabric-unifying-your-data-universe/?share=facebook)\n- [Click to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX](https://dellenny.com/data-integration-with-microsoft-fabric-unifying-your-data-universe/?share=x)\n- [Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nLinkedIn](https://dellenny.com/data-integration-with-microsoft-fabric-unifying-your-data-universe/?share=linkedin)\n- [Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram](https://dellenny.com/data-integration-with-microsoft-fabric-unifying-your-data-universe/?share=telegram)\n- [Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)\nWhatsApp](https://dellenny.com/data-integration-with-microsoft-fabric-unifying-your-data-universe/?share=jetpack-whatsapp) -\n\n### Like this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n### *Related*\n\n### Discover more from Dellenny\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\n[Subscribe](https://dellenny.com/?post_type=post&#038;p=2154)\n\n## Related Posts\n\n[![GPT‑5 Finally Arrives in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://i0.wp.com/dellenny.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/copiltoGPT.webp?fit=655%2C667&amp;ssl=1)](https://dellenny.com/gpt%e2%80%915-finally-arrives-in-microsoft-365-copilot/)\n\n[![What Is Microsoft Copilot Studio?
