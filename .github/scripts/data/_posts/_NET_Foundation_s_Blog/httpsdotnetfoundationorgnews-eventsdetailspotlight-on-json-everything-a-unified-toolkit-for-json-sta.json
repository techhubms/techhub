  "EnhancedContent": "Working with JSON is a daily ritual for modern developers, but managing different specifications like Schema validation, Patch operations, or Path queries can quickly become a fragmented experience. That's where JSON Everything steps in. Built entirely in .NET and designed with standards compliance and performance in mind, JSON Everything is a powerful open-source project that brings all the major JSON specs under one well-structured roof.\n\nAt its core, JSON Everything is a library collection that implements a wide range of JSON-related technologies. Developers can validate documents against JSON Schema (including support for drafts 6, 7, 2019-09, and 2020-12), apply JSON Patch operations, navigate with JSON Pointer, filter with JSON Path, and even execute logic using JSON Logic—all from within a consistent and extensible .NET API. The project also includes mutation and transformation utilities, which allow you to modify and convert JSON data for more advanced workflows.\n\nEach part of the project is modular, which means you can integrate only the components you need, making it easy to manage and reducing unnecessary complexity. Whether you're validating request payloads in your web API, transforming configuration files, building complex rules engines, or creating developer tools, JSON Everything offers a comprehensive foundation that can be tailored to your specific requirements.\n\nCreated and actively maintained by Greg Dennis, JSON Everything is thoughtfully documented, available on NuGet, and open for community contributions. The documentation site makes it easy to explore each module and understand how it fits into your application, while the GitHub repository provides everything you need to get started quickly.\n\nIf you're building .NET applications that rely on JSON—and let's be honest, who isn't—JSON Everything is one of those projects that deserves a spot in your toolbox. It simplifies complexity by providing a unified solution for managing different JSON specifications, streamlines standards support by implementing a wide range of JSON-related technologies, and brings order to the ever-growing world of JSON-based workflows.\n\nYou can learn more at docs.json-everything.net or dive into the code at github.com/json-everything/json-everything.",
