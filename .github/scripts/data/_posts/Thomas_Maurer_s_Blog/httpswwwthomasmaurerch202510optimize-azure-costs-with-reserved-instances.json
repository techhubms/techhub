this episode of the [Azure Essentials Show](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/tag/azure-essentials-show/), I am joined by Priyanshi from Microsoft Azure to explore how organizations can optimize their cloud spending using Azure Reserved Virtual Machine Instances. The discussion covers the fundamentals of reserved instances, practical strategies for leveraging Azure’s recommendations, and key best practices to maximize savings while maintaining performance and scalability.\n\nIn this episode you will learn:\n\n- How Azure Reserved VM Instances work and the billing benefits they offer for predictable workloads.\n- Ways to use Azure Advisor and historical usage data to identify the best reservation options for your environment.\n- Best practices and common pitfalls to avoid when purchasing and managing reservations, including scope, utilization alerts, and auto-renewal.\n\nSuggested next steps:\n\n- Review your organization’s VM usage in Azure and explore reservation recommendations in Azure Advisor or the reservation purchase flow.\n- Set up RI Utilization Alerts and enable auto-renewal to proactively manage reservation benefits.\n- Visit Microsoft Learn and watch the recommended video series for step-by-step guidance on purchasing and monitoring Azure reservations.\n\nLearn more here: [Save with Azure reservations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/)\n\nEmail address:\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nTags: [Azure](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/tag/azure/), [Azure Essentials Show](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/tag/azure-essentials-show/), [Cloud](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/tag/cloud/), [Microsoft](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/tag/microsoft/), [Microsoft Azure](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/tag/microsoft-azure/) Last modified: October 31, 2025\n\n### About the Author / [Thomas Maurer](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/author/d9pe/)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nThomas is the EMEA Global Black Belt (GBB) for Sovereign Cloud at Microsoft, helping organizations across the region harness Microsoft’s sovereign, hybrid, multicloud, and edge solutions.
