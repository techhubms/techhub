this video I will provide a brief Azure Local Overview, why it exists, and where it fits in with your hybrid cloud architecture. I cover primary use cases such as hybrid infrastructure, edge computing, digital sovereignty, and disconnected scenarios, and I walk through the benefits of running diverse workloads locally while retaining cloud management.\n\n⚡Keep in mind, that since this video was recorded, new features and services have been added.\n\nYou’ll see real examples of supported workloads including:\n\n- Virtual Machines (Windows and Linux)\n- Containers on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)\n- Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)\n- AI and inference workloads\n- Databases\n- Other platform services available in Azure Local\n\nI demonstrate how to manage [Azure Local](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/tag/azure-local/) directly from the Azure portal, show the control plane experience, and highlight key management services, security, monitoring, and lifecycle operations. This walkthrough is aimed at architects, IT pros, and cloud engineers who want a practical introduction to deploying and managing cloud-connected infrastructure with Azure. If this helped you, like the video, subscribe to the Thomas Maurer channel, and leave a comment with which workload or demo you want next. Feel free to share this with teammates planning edge or sovereign-cloud projects.\n\n## 📺 Chapters and timestamps\n\n[0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4) Intro and what Azure Local is [1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=60s) Core use cases: edge computing and digital sovereignty [2:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=147s) Azure Local cloud-connected Infrastructure solution [4:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=252s) Azure Local Architecture overview and components [8:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=510s) Demo: Azure portal management experience [13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=824s) Demo: Workloads on Azure Local and management capabilities [14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=890s) Demo: Azure Local Security features with Defender for Cloud [17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=1026s) Demo: Azure Monitor for Azure Local [18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=1128s) Demo: Manage and deploy virtual machines on Azure Local [26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=1590s) Demo: Manage Updates for Azure Local with Azure Update Manager [28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=1682s) High availability and Disaster Recovery on Azure Local [31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=1894s) Azure Local Security [33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=2005s) Demo: Azure Site Manager [35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=2134s) Azure Local Disconnected Operations [37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=2239s) AI services on Azure Local and KAITO [38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=2317s) Azure Local Hardware solutions and sizing [46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=2807s) Pricing and Azure Hybrid Benefits [49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv6NxRv8TW4&amp;t=2960s) Summary and next steps\n\n## 📖 Azure Local Overview – Resources and Links\n\n- [Azure Local Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/)\n- [Azure Local Hybrid Benefit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/concepts/azure-hybrid-benefit)\n- [Azure Local Catalog](https://aka.ms/azurelocalcatalog)\n- [Edge RAG on Azure Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/edge-rag/deploy-overview)\n- [KAITO on Azure Local](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurearcblog/public-preview-deploy-oss-large-language-models-with-kaito-on-aks-on-azure-local/4415453)\n- [Azure Local Disconnected Operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/manage/disconnected-operations-overview?view=azloc-2510)\n- [Blog: Azure Local Gartner Magic Quadrant 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-recognized-once-again-as-a-leader-for-its-ability-to-execute-and-completeness-of-vision-in-2024-gartner-magic-quadrant-for-distributed-hybrid-infrastructure/)\n\nEmail address:\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\nLast modified: October 28, 2025\n\n### About the Author / [Thomas Maurer](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/author/d9pe/)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nThomas is the EMEA Global Black Belt (GBB) for Sovereign Cloud at Microsoft, helping organizations across the region harness Microsoft’s sovereign, hybrid, multicloud, and edge solutions.
