The core issue is that not only do developers lack the time needed to proactively resolve these issues, they are overwhelmed by alerts that lack any meaningful context about the actual level of risk a vulnerability represents to the organization, he added.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nCheckmarx, in the meantime, has been making a case for applying AI to application security, most recently in the form of a [Checkmarx One Developer Assist](https://checkmarx.com/press-releases/checkmarx-enables-real-time-code-security-with-launch-of-developer-assist-agent-for-ai-native-ides/) tool that is now generally available. Integrated into the Checkmarx One application security platform, the Checkmarx One Developer Assist tool is an AI agent designed to be integrated into the integrated developer environment being used to build applications. Checkmarx later this year also plans to add Policy Assist and Insights Assist agents later this year to further improve software supply chain security.\n\nThose issues will only be further exacerbated with the rise of AI coding tools. For example, a third of the 504 application developers that participated in the survey said more than 60% of code is AI-generated, even though only 18% have usage of those tools approved by their organization. Much of that code contains vulnerabilities simply because many of the examples of code used to train the large language models (LLMs) relied on by AI coding tools are, from a security perspective, deeply flawed, noted Kinsbruner.\n\nAdditionally, more than two-thirds of all respondents (67%) say half or more of their organization’s application code is made up of open-source software, which may have vulnerabilities that their organization will need a maintainer of an open source project to remediate.\n\nWhile a lot of progress has been made in terms of adopting best DevSecOps workflows, there is, by any measure, a long way yet to go before software supply chains can be considered secure.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Codehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Codehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Codehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Codehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Codehttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Code%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Code%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Code%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Code%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dsurvey-traces-large-amount-of-breaches-back-to-vulnerable-code&amp;linkname=Survey%20Traces%20Large%20Amount%20of%20Breaches%20Back%20to%20Vulnerable%20Code%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Eclipse Foundation Publishes Toolkit to Simplify CRA Compliance](https://devops.com/eclipse-foundation-publishes-toolkit-to-simplify-cra-compliance/)\n\n[Sentry Adds Tool for Monitoring MCP Servers to APM Platform »](https://devops.com/sentry-adds-tool-for-monitoring-mcp-servers-to-apm-platform/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
