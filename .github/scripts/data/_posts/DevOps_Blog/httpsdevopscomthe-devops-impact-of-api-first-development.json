Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nThe DevOps Impact of API-First Development\n\nBalaji Raghavan, chief technology officer at Postman, breaks down key findings from the company’s 7th Annual State of the API Report — offering an inside look at how APIs are reshaping software development and DevOps practices worldwide.\n\nRaghavan notes that APIs have evolved from tactical integration tools into strategic enablers of digital transformation. According to the report, nearly every software organization now relies on APIs to connect distributed systems, streamline development, and accelerate product delivery. What’s changing, he explains, is the scale and complexity of API ecosystems — and how DevOps teams are adapting to manage them securely and efficiently.\n\nThey highlight several trends emerging from the survey: the rise of API-first development, the growing importance of governance and lifecycle management, and the increasing use of AI to design, test, and monitor APIs. For DevOps teams, this means embedding API observability and automation directly into their pipelines to improve performance and reliability.\n\nRaghavan also discussed how teams are addressing the challenges of security, version control, and dependency sprawl as APIs become more interconnected across multi-cloud environments. He stressed that visibility and collaboration remain key — developers, platform engineers, and security teams must work from a shared source of truth to keep up with the pace of API-driven innovation.\n\nUltimately, the report’s message is clear: APIs are no longer supporting players in the DevOps ecosystem — they’re the backbone of modern software delivery. The organizations that invest in automation, governance, and developer experience will be the ones that thrive as API complexity continues to grow.\n\n[![VMware at KubeCon NA 2025](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kubecon-banner_dark-Version-A-600x300-.jpg)](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2025/10/13/vmware-by-broadcom-at-kubecon-north-america-2025/)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLotLY1RC8HouuSff0OQJQP9ex0k0xLVqj)\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-devops-impact-of-api-first-development%2F&amp;linkname=The%20DevOps%20Impact%20of%20API-First%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Vibe Coding vs. Spec-Driven Development: Finding Balance in the AI Era](https://devops.com/vibe-coding-vs-spec-driven-development-finding-balance-in-the-ai-era/)\n\n[Survey Surfaces Multiple DevOps Platform Migration Challenges »](https://devops.com/survey-surfaces-multiple-devops-platform-migration-challenges/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
