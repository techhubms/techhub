Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nHow DevOps Is Evolving for the Age of Intelligent Automation\n\nAt swampUP 2025 in Napa Valley, Alan sat down with Vishal Raina and Shibashis Mishra to discuss how DevOps is adapting to a new era defined by artificial intelligence, automation, and digital transformation at scale. As organizations embed AI across their software delivery pipelines, the conversation has shifted from simple productivity gains to questions of governance, trust, and long-term sustainability.\n\nThey discuss the growing need for DevOps teams to balance rapid innovation with responsible automation. While AI and machine learning tools have made it easier to generate, deploy, and test code, they’ve also introduced new challenges — from security risks and model drift to explainability and regulatory compliance. The key, they noted, lies in integrating responsible AI practices directly into existing DevOps workflows rather than treating them as separate initiatives.\n\nThey also explore the evolution of intelligent automation and its impact on modern engineering culture. Traditional DevOps principles of speed and collaboration are being redefined by AI systems that learn, adapt, and sometimes act autonomously. To keep pace, teams are building new layers of observability, policy enforcement, and model lifecycle management — effectively creating an “AI-ready DevOps” discipline that blends governance with scalability.\n\nOne message was clear: the future of DevOps isn’t just about moving faster; it’s about moving smarter. By embedding ethical design, transparency, and accountability into every stage of the pipeline, organizations can unlock the full potential of AI without compromising stability or security. As AI-driven development continues to accelerate, the next evolution of DevOps will be measured not only by deployment frequency but by how well it maintains control, compliance, and trust across increasingly intelligent systems.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-devops-is-evolving-for-the-age-of-intelligent-automation%2F&amp;linkname=How%20DevOps%20Is%20Evolving%20for%20the%20Age%20of%20Intelligent%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Analysis Identifies 10 AI Coding Tool Behaviors That Ignore Best Software Engineering Practices](https://devops.com/analysis-identifies-10-ai-coding-tool-behaviors-that-ignore-best-software-engineering-practices/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
