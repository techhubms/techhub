Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nPagerDuty Adds Suite of AI Agents to IT Management Platform\n\nPagerDuty today added a suite of artificial intelligence (AI) agents to its IT management platform that includes one designed to function as a site reliability engineer (SRE).\n\nPart of the Fall ‘25 release of the PagerDuty platform, the suite of A agents includes the PagerDuty Insights Agent which surfaces answers to queries and recommendations to prevent issues from arising, and a PagerDuty SRE Agent, available in early access, that is capable of generating runbooks that it automatically updates as changes to the IT environment are made.\n\nThere is also a PagerDuty Scribe Agent that instantly transcribes Zoom calls and chat conversations in addition to generating structured summaries and status updates that can be shared via Slack or Microsoft Team,s and a PagerDuty Shift Agent that detects and automatically resolves on-call scheduling conflicts.\n\nFinally, PagerDuty is also now making a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that will make the data it collects accessible to third-party AI applications and agents, generally available in addition to providing tighter integration with the Backstage internal developer platform (IDP) service provided by Spotify.\n\nDavid Williams, senior vice president of product for PagerDuty, said these agents collectively will enable IT teams to dramatically reduce the current time and effort required to resolve IT incidents. The overall goal is to reduce the amount of context switching that IT teams currently experience when navigating multiple tools, he added.\n\n![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PagerDuty-SRE-Agent-Fall-25-Launch.png)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nIt’s not clear to what degree IT teams might eventually trust AI agents to autonomously complete a task, but there are plenty of manual processes that could be automated without having any potential impact on IT operations. In fact, as much of that toil becomes automated the overall amount of stress that many IT administrators and DevOps engineers currently experience should be sharply reduced.\n\nIt’s not likely AI agents will replace the need for IT professionals any time soon, but they should make it simpler to manage complex IT environments at scale. Right now, many organizations have to limit the number of applications they build and deploy because it is too costly to hire additional personnel.\n\nMany existing members of those IT staffs, meanwhile, are experiencing high levels of burnout because many of the tasks they need to perform have simply become too monotonous for them to ever enjoy doing.\n\nAt this juncture, it’s not so much a question of if [AI will be applied to DevOps workflows](https://devops.com/shadow-how-ai-coding-agents-are-transforming-devops-workflows/) as it is to the degree. Savvy DevOps teams are already identifying tasks that might be better handled by an AI agent, which in turn should free them up to take on more challenging projects.\n\nRegardless of motivation, the one thing that is clear is that AI agents will soon change the way DevOps teams are structured and organized in ways that will, hopefully, lead to more software being built and deployed than anyone might have ever imagined a few short years ago.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platformhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platformhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platformhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platformhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platformhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platform%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platform%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platform%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platform%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fpagerduty-adds-suite-of-ai-agents-to-it-management-platform%2F&amp;linkname=PagerDuty%20Adds%20Suite%20of%20AI%20Agents%20to%20IT%20Management%20Platform%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Common IaC Security Issues and How to Fix Them](https://devops.com/common-iac-security-issues-and-how-to-fix-them/)\n\n[Spacelift Adds Open Source AI Vibecoding Tool to Provision Infrastructure »](https://devops.com/spacelift-adds-open-source-ai-vibecoding-tool-to-provision-infrastructure/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
