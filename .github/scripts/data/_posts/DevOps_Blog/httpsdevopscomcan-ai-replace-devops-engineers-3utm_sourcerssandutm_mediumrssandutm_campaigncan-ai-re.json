Not anytime soon.\n\nIn my experience working with engineering teams across industries, I’ve seen just how fast cloud infrastructure is evolving. Automation and AI are certainly becoming more embedded in daily workflows. And yes, they can take over certain tasks, especially the tedious, repetitive ones. But if you think that means engineers are becoming obsolete, you’re missing the plot entirely.\n\nIf anything, what AI is doing is revealing how critical skilled engineers still are, and will continue to be.\n\n### **The Story Behind the Hype**\n\nThe industry loves a good headline. “AI is coming for your job!” “DevOps without the devs!” It’s easy to get swept up in that energy.\n\nBut the real world isn’t a press release.\n\nHere’s a quick example from a client I worked with recently: they proudly demoed a Terraform configuration to spin up their environment. On paper, it looked solid—clean, properly formatted, no syntax issues. But it didn’t work. At all.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nTurns out, the code was AI-generated. It looked polished, but it wasn’t functional. It hadn’t been validated. It didn’t reflect the actual infrastructure setup. It was all surface, no substance – a reminder that code generation without understanding is just theater.\n\nAnd that’s not a one-off. I’ve seen it happen more than once.\n\n### **Fast Isn’t Always Smart**\n\nLet’s be clear: tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude can be incredibly helpful. They can speed up scaffolding, suggest fixes, and help with repetitive scripting. But their knowledge comes from public data. They don’t know *your* stack. They don’t know your security policies. They don’t follow your team’s naming conventions or compliance rules.\n\nIn fact, I’ve heard stories of AI-generated infrastructure code that includes deprecated syntax or outdated APIs. One engineer told me he had an entire Azure policy fail silently because the AI-generated config used the wrong version schema. It took hours to debug.\n\nThat’s the risk. AI gets you there faster, but if it’s the wrong direction, you just crash sooner.\n\n### **Augmentation &gt; Automation**\n\nWhere AI *is* making progress is in deterministic workflows — tools that operate on rules, not guesses. Think of systems that understand Policy-as-Code and can generate merge-ready fixes based on defined organizational standards.\n\nThey aren’t trying to be creative. They’re trying to be right.\n\nThis kind of AI behaves more like a very efficient junior engineer: it flags issues, prepares clean pull requests, and works quietly in the background. But it doesn’t deploy without you. It still relies on human judgment and review.\n\nAnd that’s the point. It’s not replacing anyone. It’s removing friction. It’s streamlining the work so engineers can focus on harder, higher-value challenges.\n\nEven Gartner seems to agree. In their 2024 Hype Cycle for Site Reliability Engineering, they flagged “AI Assistants for Infrastructure as Code” as a rising category, specifically because they enhance, not replace, engineering roles.\n\n### **Some Things Only People Do Well**\n\nNo AI tool is going to understand why your U.S. West region is under a deployment freeze due to legal concerns. Or that your team is shipping a critical feature by Friday and can’t risk a surprise regression. Or that your lead engineer is OOO and won’t be reviewing that PR until Monday.\n\nIt won’t sit through a sprint retro. It won’t handle an outage call at 2 a.m. It won’t balance trade-offs or debate system design with the team.\n\nEven as AI gets better at writing and fixing code, it still doesn’t handle the nuance. DevOps isn’t just scripts and pipelines. It’s conversations. Decisions. Context.\n\nAnd none of that’s going away.\n\n### **Looking Ahead: What Might Change**\n\nNow, while I don’t believe engineers are being replaced, I *do* think their role is shifting. We’re seeing the rise of what I’d call “AI-aware engineers.” These are people who guide AI tooling — tuning it, checking its output, defining the rules it should follow.\n\nExpect to see more emphasis on policy-as-code, declarative security, and infrastructure governance baked into CI/CD pipelines.\n\nA CNCF survey recently reported that 67% of platform teams view AI-enabled automation as a top investment. Not to cut headcount but to eliminate manual toil.\n\nThis is the new path: let AI handle the routine, while humans tackle the real problems.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nTrying to replace DevOps engineers with AI misses the point entirely. Automation is valuable, sure. But DevOps is fundamentally about context, coordination, and accountability – things no machine is ready to own.\n\nWhat we *should* focus on is how to best pair engineers with the right tools. Let AI take the grunt work. Let people steer the ship.\n\nBecause the future isn’t hands-free. It’s *hands-on* – just with a lot more support behind the scenes\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3Fhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3F%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3F%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3F%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3F%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fcan-ai-replace-devops-engineers-3%2F&amp;linkname=Can%20AI%20Replace%20DevOps%20Engineers%3F%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Harness Delivers on AI Promise for DevOps](https://devops.com/harness-delivers-on-ai-promise-for-devops/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
