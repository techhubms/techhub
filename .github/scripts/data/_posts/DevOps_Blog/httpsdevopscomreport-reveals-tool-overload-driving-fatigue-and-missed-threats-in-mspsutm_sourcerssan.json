MSPs experiencing high alert fatigue are significantly more likely to miss real threats.\n\nThe very tools deployed to enhance security are creating blind spots through exhaustion.\n\n**The Scale of the Problem**\n\nThe average MSP now runs five security tools, with 20% juggling seven to ten and 12% managing more than ten.\n\nOnly 11% report seamless integration. The remaining 89% must flip between separate dashboards and waste time on manual workflows.\n\nOne in four security alerts prove meaningless, with some MSPs reporting that 70% of their alerts are false alarms.\n\nAmong MSPs managing 1,000+ clients, 100% report daily fatigue.\n\n>\n> “MSPs are drowning in complexity, not from threats, but from the tools meant to stop them,” said Jesper Frederiksen, CEO at Heimdal. “Every new point solution adds another agent, console, and alert stream. That noise exhausts people and quietly degrades protection.”\n>\n\n**Beyond Security Operations**\n\nAgent fatigue extends beyond alert management. Disconnected platforms slow billing processes, complicate client onboarding, and create compliance reporting headaches.\n\n>\n> “Agent fatigue isn’t just a tech issue. It’s a business risk,” said Jason Whitehurst, CEO at FutureSafe. “MSPs are juggling tool after tool, but they don’t work together.”\n>\n\n**The Solution Hiding in Plain Sight**\n\nDespite widespread recognition of the problem, only 20% of MSPs have [consolidated their security solutions](https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/consolidated-platform-cybersecurity/). Those who have reported fewer alerts, faster response times, and happier staff.\n\n**Key Survey Findings**\n\n- 56% experience alert fatigue daily or weekly, 75% at least monthly\n- Only 11% enjoy seamless tool connectivity\n- MSPs using 7+ tools report nearly double the fatigue levels\n- High false positive rates triple the chance of missing genuine incidents\n- The 20% who consolidate report better outcomes across all metrics\n\n**Research Methodology**\n\nThe State of MSP Agent Fatigue 2025 surveyed 80 North American MSPs in H1 2025, combining quantitative analysis with thematic coding of over 300 free-text responses.\n\nUsers can download the complete report free at: [heimdalsecurity.com/msp-agent-fatigue-report](http://heimdalsecurity.com/msp-agent-fatigue-report%C2%A0%C2%A0)\n\n**About Heimdal**\n\nEstablished in Copenhagen in 2014, [Heimdal](https://heimdalsecurity.com/)empowers security teams and [MSPs through unified cybersecurity solutions](https://heimdalsecurity.com/) spanning endpoint to network security, including[vulnerability management](https://heimdalsecurity.com/enterprise-security/products/patch-management-software), threat prevention, and ransomware mitigation.\n\n**About FutureSafe**\n\n[FutureSafe is the exclusive provider](https://futuresafe.com/) of Heimdal in the United States, helping MSPs cut through tool sprawl and deliver consolidated cybersecurity.\n\n##### Contact\n\n**Head of Content & PR** **Danny Mitchell** **Heimdal Security** **dmi@heimdalsecurity.com**\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Freport-reveals-tool-overload-driving-fatigue-and-missed-threats-in-msps%2F&amp;linkname=Report%20Reveals%20Tool%20Overload%20Driving%20Fatigue%20and%20Missed%20Threats%20in%20MSPshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Freport-reveals-tool-overload-driving-fatigue-and-missed-threats-in-msps%2F&amp;linkname=Report%20Reveals%20Tool%20Overload%20Driving%20Fatigue%20and%20Missed%20Threats%20in%20MSPshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Freport-reveals-tool-overload-driving-fatigue-and-missed-threats-in-msps%2F&amp;linkname=Report%20Reveals%20Tool%20Overload%20Driving%20Fatigue%20and%20Missed%20Threats%20in%20MSPshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Freport-reveals-tool-overload-driving-fatigue-and-missed-threats-in-msps%2F&amp;linkname=Report%20Reveals%20Tool%20Overload%20Driving%20Fatigue%20and%20Missed%20Threats%20in%20MSPshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Freport-reveals-tool-overload-driving-fatigue-and-missed-threats-in-msps%2F&amp;linkname=Report%20Reveals%20Tool%20Overload%20Driving%20Fatigue%20and%20Missed%20Threats%20in%20MSPshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
