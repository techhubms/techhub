Just under a third (31%) reported that they are experimenting with implementation, compared to only 6% who said AI is not at all integrated into existing workflows at this time.\n\nMore surprisingly, a third (33%) said that 50% or more of their application security issues identified by AI tooling are now acted upon without human review. However, only 4% said between 76 – 100% of identified errors are acted upon without human intervention, compared to 26% reporting that 51-75% of identified errors are acted upon without human intervention. Another 26% said between 1-25% of identified errors require no human intervention.\n\nDespite that faith in AI, more than two-thirds (66%) also noted they have implemented review checkpoints, while nearly half (49%) have vetted AI models. Another 46% use auditing and logging, while 32% rely on secure sandboxing.\n\nAdditionally, the survey finds that adoption doesn’t always equate to complete trust. Only 22% ranked AI as ‘excellent’, while 48% said it was ‘good enough.’ A combined 30% said it was either fair or as far down as ‘very poor’. Well over a third (37%) reported occasional false positives being generated by AI tools, compared to 12% reported frequent false positives, for a total of nearly half (49%) of survey respondents who experience some false positive results. Only 11% reported that they ‘never’ see false positives.\n\nTop issues identified when using AI are integration complexity (46%), lack of trust in results (36%), poor explanation of security findings (23%), internal skills gaps (38%), and regulatory or compliance concerns (33%).\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nAustin Spires, senior director of product management for Fastly, said even with these issues and concerns, it’s clear organizations are moving rapidly to apply AI to application security. In essence, application security teams are committed to using AI as much as possible within the known limits of AI capabilities, he added. Top benefits of AI cited are an (obvious) reduction in manual effort (55%), faster vulnerability detection (50%), faster vulnerability remediation timelines (36%), and better triage capabilities (43%).\n\nThe assumption is that over time the capabilities of AI technologies will only continue to improve so investing the time and effort required to apply AI today will pay much higher dividends down the road, said Spires\n\nIn fact, 31% have a formal effort to explore new or future use cases for AI within their application security efforts, while another 49% reported that they are, though informally.\n\nEach DevSecOps team will need to determine for itself to what degree to trust AI to, for example, automatically remediate a vulnerability. The one thing that is clear is that as the volume of code being created using AI tools increases it’s only a matter of time before AI is relied on more to fix the code created by those tools. In effect, AI will be depended on to fix AI coding tools that, hopefully, will in time produce fewer errors than they tend to do today.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsurvey-surfaces-widespread-adoption-of-ai-to-improve-devsecops%2F&amp;linkname=Survey%20Surfaces%20Widespread%20Adoption%20of%20AI%20to%20Improve%20DevSecOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« MCPTotal Launches to Power Secure Enterprise MCP Workflows](https://devops.com/mcptotal-launches-to-power-secure-enterprise-mcp-workflows/)\n\n[Massive VS Code Secrets Leak Puts Focus on Extensions, AI: Wiz »](https://devops.com/massive-vs-code-secrets-leak-puts-focus-on-extensions-ai-wiz/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
