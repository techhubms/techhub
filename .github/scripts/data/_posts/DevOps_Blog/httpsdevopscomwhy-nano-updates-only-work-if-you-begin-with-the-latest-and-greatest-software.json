Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nWhy Nano Updates Only Work if You Begin with the Latest and Greatest Software\n\nIs there a silent threat of [technical debt looming in your organization](https://devops.com/technical-debt-make-developers-happier-now-or-pay-more-later/)? You probably should take a deeper look.\n\nModern software systems are composed of hundreds of interdependent components. How are you updating those components – system libraries, base containers, and app packages? Do it poorly, and you will trigger unintended side effects, like failing CI pipelines, hours of debugging, or even outages.\n\nIronically, these risks cause teams to delay updates, even when they fix critical vulnerabilities. According to [recent research](https://www.bitsight.com/press-releases/bitsight-reveals-more-60-percent-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-remain-unmitigated#:~:text=The%20report%2C%20titled%20%22A%20Global,deep%20insight%20and%20swift%20action.), 60% of known vulnerabilities remain unaddressed in the average organization today.\n\nThe solution to reducing technical debt is simple: consistent nano updates – precise, minimal changes that reduce risk while maintaining agility. However, this strategy works best when you’re starting with the latest and greatest software from the beginning. Let’s explore how implementing continuous nano updates and starting with the latest software can reduce technical debt before it starts to accumulate.\n\n### **What are Continuous Nano Updates – and Why are They Different?**\n\nNano updates are surgical upgrades that continuously apply the smallest possible change needed to update systems. This eliminates security vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of unintended side effects while improving control and traceability. Developers replace a single vulnerable dependency in a container without altering the rest of the image, or update a package version while preserving all surrounding libraries and configurations.\n\nNano updates allow for continuous delivery, improved collaboration and faster triage and recovery when something does break. Knowing these distinctions can make or break your approach to updates and ensure they roll out successfully.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n### **Starting with the Latest is a Prerequisite**\n\nMany organizations assume they’re “up to date” simply because they use mainstream Linux distributions like Red Hat or Ubuntu. In reality, these traditional Linux distributions ship a snapshot in time, typically from two to five years ago. These are outdated base images, with lagging dependencies and contribute to accumulating technical debt throughout their entire organizations. Using a one-year-old image doesn’t qualify as the latest version because it’s often hundreds of upstream releases behind, leaving hundreds of CVEs unpatched.\n\nNano updates only truly work when you’re already on the current software stacks. Otherwise, small updates are impractical and will have outsized effects due to compounding code drift from legacy package versions. For example, updating a base container image might pull in multiple outdated packages with incompatible and conflicting versions, yielding issues and breaking integrations. If you haven’t modernized your foundation, you can’t build a nano update strategy on top of it. It’s critical to think about this early on and ensure the foundation is there.\n\n### **Ending the Tug-of-War Between Security and Engineering Teams**\n\nOnce the latest and greatest versions of all tools are in place, engineering teams often operate in a steady state of “maintaining and monitoring.” At the same time, security teams are focused on making upgrades – and understanding the risks they pose – to protect the organization from further risks. By making regular nano updates, together engineering and security teams, can prevent longer-term risks and issues from the start.\n\nSome healthcare organizations, for example, may have long periods of software freezes like during open enrollment. Broad updates are risky during this time, but nano updates enable teams to patch vulnerabilities and avoid the most destabilizing environments. The result is that patient-critical systems remain both secure and operational. Taking this approach helps bridge the gap between security and engineering teams and ensures that technical debt isn’t looming throughout the organization.\n\n### **Helping Developers get a Leg Up by Starting Clean and Staying Clean**\n\nBest-in-class developers are adopting nano updates as part of modern CI/CD workflows and seeing benefits from continuous delivery as smaller incremental changes facilitate more frequent, reliable deployments. They’re also improving collaboration across their development and operations teams and seeing faster recovery as pinpointing and reverting specific changes to issues becomes more straightforward.\n\nHowever, developers in legacy organizations often struggle to adopt this mindset. To bridge that gap, there are four steps they can take to set themselves up for success:\n\n1. *Rebase first*: Start by modernizing base containers and dependencies. Without this, truly nano updates aren’t really possible.\n2. *Automate dependency management:* Implement monitoring to detect and assess the impact of changes in real-time.\n3. *Monitor changes closely:* Track the effect of each nano update using observability and alerting, rolling back quickly and triaging regressions easily.\n4. *Educate the team:* Foster a culture that values incrementalism and sees continuous nano updates as a way to move faster with less risk.\n\nEngineering teams can’t afford to delay updates, but they also can’t risk instability. Nano updates give them the best of both worlds – but only after they’ve adopted the latest software versions as a baseline.\n\nThe real challenge isn’t just applying updates – it’s building a culture of discipline around starting clean and maintaining great hygiene. With this approach, organizations avoid unnecessary spending, reduce CVE exposure, empower developers with the latest software features, and move confidently in a complex, fast-moving world free of technical debt.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-nano-updates-only-work-if-you-begin-with-the-latest-and-greatest-software%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Nano%20Updates%20Only%20Work%20if%20You%20Begin%20with%20the%20Latest%20and%20Greatest%20Software%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« The Developer’s Guide to Agentic AI: The Five Stages of Agent Lifecycle Management](https://devops.com/the-developers-guide-to-agentic-ai-the-five-stages-of-agent-lifecycle-management/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
