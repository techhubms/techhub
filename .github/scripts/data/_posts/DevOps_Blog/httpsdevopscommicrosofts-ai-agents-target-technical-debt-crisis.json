Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nMicrosoft’s AI Agents Target Technical Debt Crisis\n\n[Technical debt is killing innovation](https://devops.com/technical-debt-is-a-major-threat-to-innovation/). While executives push for AI adoption, development teams struggle with legacy systems that can’t handle modern workloads. Microsoft thinks it has an answer.\n\nThe company announced Tuesday that GitHub Copilot will now include AI agents that automatically modernize legacy Java and .NET applications. These agents can do work that normally takes developers months to complete.\n\nMicrosoft also introduced new capabilities in Azure Migrate and launched Azure Accelerate, a service designed to accelerate the migration of applications to modern cloud infrastructure.\n\n### The Technical Debt Problem\n\nMost enterprises sit on decades of legacy code. These applications keep businesses running, but they create problems when companies want to add AI capabilities.\n\nLegacy systems often use outdated frameworks, lack proper APIs, and run on infrastructure that can’t scale for AI workloads. Modernizing these applications traditionally requires significant developer time and budget.\n\nCompanies face a choice: Spend months updating old code, or miss out on AI opportunities. Both options hurt the bottom line.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n### How Microsoft’s Solution Works\n\nThe new GitHub Copilot agents analyze existing codebases and identify opportunities for modernization. They can automatically update deprecated APIs, refactor code for cloud compatibility, and suggest architectural improvements.\n\nFor Java applications, agents can migrate code from older versions to modern frameworks, such as Spring Boot. They handle dependency updates and ensure compatibility with cloud-native services.\n\nThe .NET agents focus on moving applications from .NET Framework to .NET Core or .NET 5+. This migration enables better performance and cloud deployment options.\n\nAzure Migrate gets similar AI-powered capabilities. The service now provides automated assessment of legacy applications and creates modernization roadmaps. It identifies which applications are ready for cloud migration and which need additional work.\n\nAzure Accelerate packages these tools into a complete service offering. Microsoft assigns dedicated teams to work with enterprise customers on large-scale modernization projects.\n\n### Real Impact on Development Teams\n\nThese tools address genuine pain points for developers. Manual code modernization is time-consuming and error-prone. Developers often spend weeks updating a single application, time that could be better spent building new features.\n\nThe AI agents don’t replace developers. Instead, they handle routine modernization tasks, allowing developers to focus on higher-value work. Teams can allocate more time to implementing AI features rather than preparing legacy systems to support them.\n\nEarly testing shows promising results. Microsoft reports that organizations using these tools reduced modernization time by 60-70% compared to manual processes.\n\n“Microsoft’s expansion of GitHub Copilot into AI-driven application modernization squarely tackles the technical debt blocking many enterprises from adopting AI,” said Mitch Ashley, vice president and practice lead for software lifecycle engineering at [The Futurum Group](https://futurumgroup.com/). “Automating complex Java and .NET migrations can cut months off modernization timelines and realign the work of development teams. The most challenging test will be how these agents handle the messy, idiosyncratic codebases that exist in the wild. As this technology matures and proves out, it could have a radical impact on areas of the unsolved IT technical debt backlog in Java, .NET, and beyond.”\n\n### Limitations and Considerations\n\nAI agents excel at pattern recognition and routine updates, but they can’t solve every modernization challenge. Complex business logic, custom integrations, and unique architectural decisions still require human judgment.\n\nOrganizations should expect to review and test all AI-generated code changes. The agents provide a strong starting point, but developers must validate the results before deploying to production.\n\nSome applications may be too complex or too critical to be automated for modernization. Companies should identify these systems early and plan manual modernization approaches.\n\n### Market Context\n\nMicrosoft isn’t the only one targeting technical debt. Amazon Web Services offers similar services through its Application Migration Service, and Google Cloud provides modernization tools for containerizing legacy applications.\n\nBut Microsoft’s approach integrates multiple services into a cohesive platform. GitHub Copilot, Azure Migrate and Azure Accelerate work together rather than operating as separate tools.\n\nThis integrated approach is crucial because modernization projects often involve multiple systems and teams. Having unified tools reduces complexity and improves coordination.\n\n### Looking Forward\n\nThese announcements signal Microsoft’s broader strategy around AI-powered development tools. The company aims to position itself as the platform that facilitates easier AI adoption for enterprises.\n\nSuccess depends on execution. The AI agents need to handle real-world complexity, not just demo scenarios. Enterprise customers will judge these tools based on actual results, not marketing promises.\n\nFor development teams dealing with legacy systems, Microsoft’s approach offers a practical path forward. The tools won’t solve every technical debt problem, but they could eliminate months of routine modernization work.\n\nIn a competitive market where AI capabilities significantly impact business success, those time savings could make the difference between leading and following.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisishttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisishttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisishttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisishttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%E2%80%99s%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisishttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%26%23039%3Bs%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisis%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%26%23039%3Bs%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisis%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%26%23039%3Bs%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisis%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%26%23039%3Bs%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisis%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fmicrosofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis%2F&amp;linkname=Microsoft%26%23039%3Bs%20AI%20Agents%20Target%20Technical%20Debt%20Crisis%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« How GitHub Plans to Secure npm After Recent Supply Chain Attacks](https://devops.com/how-github-plans-to-secure-npm-after-recent-supply-chain-attacks/)\n\n[Securing the Software Supply Chain with Full Visibility and Compliance »](https://devops.com/securing-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
