Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nWhy Automation Fails Without the Right QA Mindset\n\nIn the DevOps world, with its faster release cycles and continuous delivery, quality assurance (QA) cannot be sidelined until the end of the process. Companies that actively use automation achieve [up to 60% faster release cycles](https://www.marketingscoop.com/ai/test-automation-statistics/) compared to those relying solely on manual testing. However, automation alone is insufficient. Without the right QA mindset, moving faster can easily backfire if quality is not built into every stage. QA teams must evolve to become quality enablers throughout the software delivery cycle. Rather than joining at the tail end of the lifecycle, they must work alongside product owners to understand functional requirements, collaborate with architects and developers to grasp solution design and ensure visibility into end-to-end solution delivery.\n\nGetting involved more deeply from day one means QA can help build quality from the outset through deployment. In response to this shift, QA professionals need to step up by:\n\n- Designing and managing automated tests in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines\n- Focusing on risk-based testing\n- Collaborating with teams to ensure quality is integrated into every step of the delivery process\n\nIn a fully automated pipeline, QA teams add the most value when they go beyond just testing and contribute as collaborative partners, strategic advisors and critical thinkers throughout the entire development process.\n\n### **The Importance of the Right QA Mindset**\n\nAutomation is key to fast, continuous delivery, but its real impact depends on the mindset driving it. In fact, [63% of organizations deploy code without thoughtful testing](https://devops.com/survey-software-quality-continues-to-be-sacrificed-in-the-name-of-speed/) in pursuit of faster delivery timelines. The so-called *developmental mindset* focuses solely on speed, code coverage and scripting mechanics — often resulting in a check-the-box mentality, where tests verify expected outcomes but overlook real-world usage, potential risks and user experience.\n\nThe *QA mindset*, by contrast, offers a broader, more critical perspective. It is rooted in exploration, skepticism and curiosity. As QA professionals, we don’t just ask whether the software works — we ask how it might fail, where it could break and whether it fulfills the user’s ultimate needs. This mindset is essential for prioritizing automated tests based on business or user risk, rather than simply following functional decomposition.\n\nWith this strategic mindset, we design automated tests that anticipate edge cases, test assumptions and reflect actual user workflows. This leads to earlier detection of defects, fewer production incidents and, ultimately, a smoother user experience. In the long run, it also improves team productivity and reduces rework and reactive firefighting by catching issues in advance.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nAutomation alone doesn’t guarantee quality — it is only as effective as the tests it is scripted to run. If the requirements are misunderstood, automated tests may pass while critical issues remain undetected. I have seen failures where teams relied solely on automation without involving proper QA practices, leading to tests that validated incorrect behavior. Automation frequently fails to detect new or unexpected issues introduced by system upgrades. It often misses critical problems such as faulty data mapping, incomplete user interface (UI) testing and gaps in test coverage due to outdated scripts.\n\nLack of adaptability is another common obstacle that I’ve repeatedly seen undermine automation testing efforts. When UI elements are tightly coupled, even minor changes can disrupt test cases. With the right QA mindset, this challenge is anticipated — promoting modular, maintainable automation strategies capable of adapting to frequent UI and logic changes.\n\nAutomation lacks the critical analysis required to validate business logic and perform true end-to-end testing. From my experience, the human QA mindset proved essential during the testing of a mortgage loan calculation system. While automation handled standard calculations and data validation, it could not assess whether the logic aligned with real-world lending rules. Here is where human insight was crucial: Automated tests confirmed data processing and standard calculations, but couldn’t verify whether the outputs complied with evolving lending regulations and complex business requirements. QA ensures that test scenarios are aligned with business goals and remain adaptable to change.\n\nAs QA professionals, we often serve as a bridge between developers and business teams — translating business requirements into actionable testing scenarios and ensuring the team’s efforts focus on what truly matters.\n\n### **Why Human QA Thinking is Irreplaceable**\n\nAutomated scripts can only validate what they have been explicitly designed to check. That is why human-driven testing remains essential, even in highly automated pipelines. Human-driven testing is especially valuable for UI and user experience (UX) validation, exploratory testing and identifying edge cases that automation may miss.\n\nFor example, in a human capital management payroll system upgrade project with zero downtime, we applied a hybrid testing strategy that combined automated and manual efforts. Automated regression scripts ensured core functionality remained stable, while human-driven tests were used to validate new scenarios and feature upgrades. This ensured proper integration with other modules and subsystems. The result was a fast, stable CI/CD pipeline that still allowed space for creativity.\n\nHuman insight remains a critical part of both DevOps and QA. Without a mindset grounded in strategy, risk awareness and a deep understanding of how real users interact with software, automation can mislead teams. Quality teams don’t just bring tools — they bring perspective. By asking the hard questions, they ensure testing efforts stay aligned with what truly matters to both the business and the end user.\n\n### **Key Tips to Strengthen Your QA Mindset**\n\nIn conclusion, here are the key QA mindset principles for successful test automation:\n\n- Integrate QA from the start**.** Involve QA early in the process — don’t wait until the end.\n- Adopt a risk-based, user-focused approach. Prioritize testing based on business impact and user risk. Go beyond validating expected outcomes — explore how the software might fail in real-world scenarios.\n- Design maintainable and adaptable test automation. **** Avoid brittle scripts that break with every minor change.\n- Blend automation with manual testing. **** Let automation handle data and calculations, and human testers cover new features, UI/UX and edge cases through exploratory testing.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindsethttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindsethttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindsethttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindsethttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindsethttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindset%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindset%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindset%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindset%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fwhy-automation-fails-without-the-right-qa-mindset%2F&amp;linkname=Why%20Automation%20Fails%20Without%20the%20Right%20QA%20Mindset%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Pulumi Previews AI Agents Trained to Automate Infrastructure Management](https://devops.com/pulumi-previews-ai-agents-trained-to-automate-infrastructure-management/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
