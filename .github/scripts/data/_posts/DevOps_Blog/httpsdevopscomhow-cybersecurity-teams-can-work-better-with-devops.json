Often, cybersecurity and DevOps teams work separately, and that could lead to problems.\n\nTo fix this, organizations must shift from viewing security as a checkpoint to embedding it in DevOps at every step.\n\nThis article explores how to infuse security in DevOps from the ground up. This way, both sides can collaborate better, reduce friction, and build safer systems without slowing down.\n\n### **The Need for Security in DevOps**\n\nSecurity in DevOps (often called DevSecOps) refers to the implementation of security controls at every stage within the development pipeline. This allows development and operations teams to work together and test security during their entire course, rather than tackling it later.\n\nModern threat levels and compliance demands make Security in DevOps essential. By shifting security to development, vulnerabilities are caught and corrected early, minimizing rework costs and risks.\n\nOrganizations that embrace this approach report clear benefits: fewer defect costs and a culture where everyone is accountable for security.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n### **Common Challenges in Cybersecurity / DevOps Collaboration**\n\nIt’s ideal to position cybersecurity into DevOps, but in practice, teams disagree regarding speed, ownership, and processes. The following challenges may slow development if not corrected early:\n\n- **Communication silos**: Security and DevOps teams often speak different languages using different tools and metrics. SOC teams discuss threats and compliance, while DevOps engineers think about pipelines and performance. This miscommunication causes slower response times and creates friction.\n- **Conflicting priorities**: The security team’s mission is to decrease risk and maintain compliance, while innovation and speed are where DevOps prioritizes. The tension between the two groups provides a perception that security comes last.\n- **Unclear responsibilities**: In many organizations, alerts bounce back and forth because it’s unclear if DevOps or security should address them. This uncertainty wastes time and allows threats to pass by.\n- **Skills and awareness gaps**: Traditional cybersecurity staff might not have cloud-native or container expertise, and DevOps engineers may lack deep training in security. Similarly, developers may never have coded securely. These gaps make it harder to collaborate on technical issues.\n\n### **Best Practices for Integrating Security in DevOps**\n\nIntegrating security in DevOps requires something more than new tools; it demands a mindset shift. The following are important practices to integrate security into development without slowing it down.\n\n### **Define shared responsibilities**\n\nMake a very concise list with clarity regarding who’s responsible for what. For example, threats are handled by the security team, and setup or containers are fixed by DevOps. It keeps things from becoming confusing and makes sure nothing gets missed.\n\n### **Cross-train teams and appoint security champions**\n\nTrain security teams to understand how DevOps tools work, and also help DevOps teams perform basic security tasks. You can also rotate team members between both groups to build a deeper understanding.\n\nChoose a security champion in each DevOps team, someone who gets more training and who works closely with their security team. The security champions help turn security requirements into clear action items for developers, making collaboration smoother.\n\n### **Integrate automated security into CI/CD**\n\nUse automated tools like code scanners (SAST), application security testers (DAST), dependency checkers, and IaC scanners to review code and settings each time changes are made. This helps catch basic security issues early without needing to require someone to manually check everything.\n\n### **Unified visibility and Tooling**\n\nCombine alerts from different tools into a single shared system or dashboard, like a bug tracker or Slack channels. If everyone sees the same data and priorities, it’s very easy to cooperate and trust each other.\n\n### **Regular communication routine**\n\nEstablish joint workflows and meetings. This includes security and DevOps perspectives. Gather everyone around after an incident to go through what happened without pointing fingers. Also, have security office hours devoted to DevOps to speak to security specialists.\n\nThese regular talks foster healthy relationships. The meetings help to prevent undesirable attitudes that come up in crises.\n\n### **Foster a DevSecOps culture**\n\nMake security a part of the company culture. Leaders should celebrate and recognize security successes, and everyone, from interns to the CIO, should know they are all responsible for helping make things secure.\n\nInvest time and money into training, threat-awareness drills, and DevOps security certifications. This keeps everyone up to date. Always look to get better: utilize metrics and hold retrospectives to get better.\n\nOver time, security in DevOps becomes normal, not something that’s an afterthought.\n\n### **Continuous Improvement**\n\nSecurities in DevOps are a work in progress. Track things like how many security issues come up and how quickly they’re fixed. It helps with getting better.\n\nAfter a problem, look back to see what went wrong and how to be better next time. When Security and DevOps work together, use the same toolset, and automate tests, they can easily deliver software more securely.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-cybersecurity-teams-can-work-better-with-devops%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Cybersecurity%20Teams%20Can%20Work%20Better%20with%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Cybersecurity Laws Will Shape the Future of DevOps](https://devops.com/cybersecurity-laws-will-shape-the-future-of-devops/)\n\n[How I Automated My Most Tedious Task and Unlocked Our Growth Strategy »](https://devops.com/how-i-automated-my-most-tedious-task-and-unlocked-our-growth-strategy/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
