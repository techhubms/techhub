Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nFive Great DevOps Job Opportunities\n\nDevOps.com is now providing a weekly DevOps jobs report through which opportunities for DevOps professionals will be highlighted as part of an effort to better serve our audience.\n\nOur goal in these challenging economic times is to make it just that much easier for DevOps professionals to advance their careers.\n\nOf course, the pool of available DevOps talent is still relatively constrained, so when one DevOps professional takes on a new role, it tends to create opportunities for others.\n\nThe five job postings shared this week are selected based on the company looking to hire, the vertical industry segment and naturally, the pay scale being offered.\n\nWe’re also committed to [providing additional insights](https://devops.com/webinars/ai-and-your-devops-career-adapting-and-thriving-in-an-evolving-landscape/) into the state of the DevOps job market.
