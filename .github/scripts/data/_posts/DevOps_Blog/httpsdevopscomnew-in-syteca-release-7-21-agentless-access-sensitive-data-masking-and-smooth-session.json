Syteca 7.21 is a major update designed to enhance user privacy, simplify access management, provide seamless oversight, and improve the user experience.\n\nWith release 7.21, Syteca delivers a set of new capabilities, from masking sensitive information in real time to simplifying remote access. These new features help address the most pressing challenges faced by security teams worldwide.\n\n**Sensitive Data Masking**\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nSyteca has become the first cybersecurity vendor to deliver real-time sensitive data masking. With this feature, the platform automatically detects and obscures confidential information (e.g., passwords, credit card numbers, or personal IDs) during live sessions and in recordings. By blurring this data, Syteca helps prevent exposure of private information and supports compliance with data privacy regulations like the GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.\n\n**Web Connection Manager**\n\nUsers can now launch remote sessions (RDP for Windows or SSH for Linux/Unix) directly in web browsers (Chrome, Safari, and Edge). This means that IT teams don’t bother with installing agents, pushing updates, or troubleshooting installation issues. They just provide fast and secure access for both employees and vendors.\n\n**Full-Motion Capture of On-Screen Activity**\n\nThe Syteca platform can now record continuous videos of user sessions, capturing every click and cursor movement. Full-motion session recordings give security teams complete visibility into user activity, which can provide more detailed audit trails and speed up incident investigations. Every session is encrypted for security.\n\n**Intuitive UI**\n\nBeyond new capabilities, Syteca 7.21 introduces a redesigned user interface. The updated UI has a cleaner design while keeping familiar navigation in place. The lighter interface and reduced on-screen clutter help users find key information faster, thus streamlining daily security tasks.\n\n>\n> “Release 7.21 gives organizations better visibility and control over their internal security,” says Oleg Shomonko, CEO of Syteca. “Features like live data masking, full-motion session recordings, and browser-based access mean our clients can enhance the security of their assets and streamline compliance while reducing IT overhead. This update reflects our focus on solving real IT security challenges without adding complexity.”\n>\n\nUsers interested in trying Syteca’s brand new capabilities can access the demo portal at [syteca.com](http://syteca.com/).\n\n**About Syteca**\n\n[Syteca](https://www.syteca.com/en/company/about-us)is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform that helps organizations worldwide protect their inside perimeter.
