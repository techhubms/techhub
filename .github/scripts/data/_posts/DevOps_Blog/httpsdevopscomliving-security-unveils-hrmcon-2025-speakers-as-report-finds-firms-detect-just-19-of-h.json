Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\n# [Home](https://devops.com/) » Living Security Unveils HRMCon 2025 Speakers as Report Finds Firms Detect Just 19% of Human Risk\n\n**Austin / TX, United States, September 25th, 2025, CyberNewsWire**\n\nLiving Security, a global leader in Human Risk Management (HRM), today announced the full speaker lineup for the [Human Risk Management Conference (HRMCon 2025)](https://www.livingsecurity.com/hrmcon-2025?utm_source=cybernewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=hrmcon_speaker_announcement), taking place October 20, 2025, at Austin’s Q2 Stadium and virtually worldwide.\n\nThe announcement follows findings from the newly published [**2025 State of Human Cyber Risk Report**](https://www.livingsecurity.com/2025-human-risk-report-key-cybersecurity-insights?utm_source=cybernewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=2025_human_risk_report&amp;utm_content=key_insights), produced by the **Cyentia Institute in collaboration with Living Security**, which reveals that on average, organizations detect only **19% of all human risk activity**. That means the majority of risky behaviors — from credential misuse to insider threats — go unseen, leaving enterprises exposed to risks that technology or traditional awareness programs alone can’t solve.\n\nHRMCon is a one-day event focused on the people side of cybersecurity, offered this year both in-person in Austin and virtually worldwide. The program is designed for CISOs, security leaders, risk managers, and HR professionals who are responsible for building security culture and reducing human-driven risk. Sessions will explore how to extend risk ownership beyond traditional awareness programs and the security operations center, empowering managers and employees across the business to take accountability. Attendees will gain practical strategies they can apply immediately from executives, global analysts, and peers. Participants with confirmed attendance may also request a completion certificate for Continuing Professional Education (CPE) credits for the full conference.\n\n>\n> “Most organizations remain blind to the majority of human-driven risk, leaving gaps that technology or traditional awareness programs alone can’t solve,” said [Ashley Rose, CEO and Co-Founder of Living Security](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-m-rose/). “Closing that visibility gap requires new strategies, proven frameworks, and collaboration across functions — which is exactly what HRMCon is designed to deliver. No matter where you are in your HRM journey, you’ll walk away with practical playbooks, proven strategies, and inspiring stories you can apply immediately. This isn’t just another security event—it’s a launchpad for making human risk a managed business function, all without pulling you away from your day-to-day responsibilities.”\n>\n\nHRMCon 2025 will feature enterprise CISOs, Fortune 500 veterans, and leading analysts sharing research-backed strategies and real-world lessons on operationalizing human risk management.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n**Speaker Highlights**\n\n**Opening Keynote – Brett Wahlin, CISO, Aurora –** From Counterintelligence to Cybersecurity: Rethinking the Human Factor Across Industries.\n\nRisk frameworks have shaped enterprise security for decades but often overlook the human element.
