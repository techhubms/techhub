Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nOpenAI’s GPT-5-Codex: A Smarter Approach to Enterprise Development\n\nOpenAI just released GPT-5-Codex, and it’s designed to handle the messy reality of enterprise software development. This isn’t just another coding assistant; it’s built for the complex, long-running tasks that define real software engineering work.\n\n### **What Makes GPT-5-Codex Different**\n\nThe most significant change is how GPT-5-Codex adjusts its thinking time according to task complexity. For quick questions or simple fixes, it responds fast. However, for large refactorings or complex debugging sessions, it can work independently for hours, up to seven hours in testing, iterating on solutions until they are successful.\n\nThis dynamic approach shows up in the numbers. For simple tasks, GPT-5-Codex uses 94% fewer tokens than standard GPT-5. For complex work, it doubles down on reasoning time, spending more effort on editing and testing code.\n\nThe model was trained specifically on real-world engineering tasks, including building projects from scratch, adding features, debugging production issues and conducting thorough code reviews. This focused training is evident in benchmark results, where GPT-5-Codex scores 51% on complex refactoring tasks compared to GPT-5’s 34%.\n\n“GPT-5-Codex represents a significant leap forward in how AI can be applied to real-world software engineering. We’ve long anticipated that AI would evolve beyond simple code creation to tackle much more difficult problems and complex development tasks, and this release shows that it’s truly happening,” said Mitch Ashley, VP and Practice Lead of Software Lifecycle Engineering at [The Futurum Group](https://futurumgroup.com/). “The real value is beyond faster coding, but in the model’s ability to handle complexity and problem spaces that require long-running tasks with much larger context windows.”\n\n### **Code Reviews That Actually Catch Problems**\n\nCode review is where GPT-5-Codex really shines. It doesn’t just scan for syntax errors; it understands project context, navigates codebases, checks dependencies and runs tests to validate changes.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. GPT-5-Codex generates 70% fewer incorrect comments than GPT-5 and produces more high-impact feedback. It averages fewer comments per pull request but makes each one count.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nAt OpenAI, GPT-5-Codex now reviews most pull requests, catching hundreds of issues daily before human reviewers even see the code. Teams can set specific review criteria, such as “@codex review for security vulnerabilities,” to focus on particular concerns.\n\n### **Better Integration Across Development Tools**\n\nThe updated Codex works everywhere developers actually code. The CLI tool is open-source and community-driven. The new IDE extension brings Codex directly into VS Code and Cursor. Cloud tasks can be created and tracked without leaving your editor.\n\nThe IDE integration is particularly smart. Codex uses context from open files and selected code to provide more accurate suggestions with shorter prompts. You can start work in the cloud, then pull it into your local IDE for final touches without losing context. Performance improvements are substantial. Cloud task completion times dropped 90% through container caching. Codex now automatically detects and runs setup scripts, installs dependencies as needed and can spin up browsers to test frontend changes visually.\n\n**Security and Safety Considerations**\n\nEnterprise teams need robust security controls. Codex runs in sandboxed environments with network access disabled by default. This prevents harmful actions on local systems and reduces the risk of prompt injection.\n\nSecurity settings are customizable. Teams can limit cloud network access to trusted domains. Local installations can require explicit approval for command execution or allow controlled web search and external connections.\n\nThe tool provides citations, terminal logs and test results for every task, making it easier to review agent work before deployment. While Codex code reviews help catch issues, OpenAI recommends using it as an additional reviewer, not a replacement for human oversight.\n\n### **Real-World Impact**\n\nCompanies are already seeing results. Cisco Meraki used Codex to handle cross-team refactoring work, generating fully tested code while developers focused on other priorities. The tool kept feature releases on schedule without adding risk.\n\nThis matches what many enterprise teams need: A way to handle routine but complex tasks without pulling senior developers away from strategic work.\n\n### **Usage and Availability**\n\nCodex comes with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu and Enterprise plans. Usage limits scale with plan levels. Plus covers focused weekly coding sessions, while Pro supports full-time development across multiple projects.\n\nEnterprise plans get shared credit pools, so teams only pay for actual usage. Business plans can purchase additional credits when needed. API access for GPT-5-Codex is coming soon for CLI users.\n\n### **The Bottom Line**\n\nGPT-5-Codex addresses real enterprise development challenges. It handles long-running tasks independently, provides meaningful code reviews and integrates smoothly into existing workflows. The security controls and usage monitoring make it viable for production environments.\n\nThis isn’t about replacing developers. It’s about giving teams a capable partner that can handle the grinding work of large refactors, thorough code reviews and complex debugging sessions. That frees human developers to focus on architecture, strategy and the creative problem-solving that drives innovation.\n\nFor enterprise teams drowning in [technical debt](https://devops.com/cultural-debt-vs-technical-debt-in-infrastructure-automation/) or struggling with code review bottlenecks, GPT-5-Codex offers a practical solution that actually understands the complexity of real software engineering work.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Developmenthttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%26%23039%3Bs%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%26%23039%3Bs%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%26%23039%3Bs%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%26%23039%3Bs%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fopenais-gpt-5-codex-a-smarter-approach-to-enterprise-development%2F&amp;linkname=OpenAI%26%23039%3Bs%20GPT-5-Codex%3A%20A%20Smarter%20Approach%20to%20Enterprise%20Development%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Oracle Delivers Java 25 Edition of Venerable Programming Language for the AI Era](https://devops.com/oracle-delivers-java-25-edition-of-venerable-programming-language-for-the-ai-era/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
