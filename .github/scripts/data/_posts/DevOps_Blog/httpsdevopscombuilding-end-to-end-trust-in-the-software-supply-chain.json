Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nBuilding End-to-End Trust in the Software Supply Chain\n\nAt swampUP 2025, JFrog’s Guy Levi, head of the architects team, highlights some of the technologies shaping the company’s next chapter. Levi’s role centers on exploring advanced technologies “beyond the horizon,” but he emphasized that swampUP isn’t about future promises — it’s about showing what’s available today.\n\nOne of the highlights Levi pointed to was AppTrust, JFrog’s initiative to establish end-to-end trust across the software supply chain. By unifying governance, risk, and compliance capabilities into a single framework, AppTrust is designed to give enterprises more confidence that applications are secure and reliable from development through deployment. The goal is to tie disparate security and verification processes into one cohesive approach that simplifies how organizations enforce trust at scale.\n\nAnother major focus was JFrog Fly, which Levi described as a breakthrough in supporting AI-era DevOps. Fly provides an “agentic repository” that integrates with Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable AI agents to securely interact with APIs and development pipelines. With AI-generated code and autonomous agents becoming part of daily workflows, Fly aims to ensure those components can be governed, tracked, and optimized just like traditional software artifacts.\n\nTogether, these initiatives underscore JFrog’s push to position itself as the system of record for modern DevOps and AI-driven development. AppTrust tackles the governance side, while Fly addresses how AI agents and automation will reshape pipelines.\n\nFor Levi, the key message was that the industry can’t afford to wait for “next year” to solve these challenges. AI and security pressures are already here, and JFrog is working to deliver the tools teams need now to navigate them.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chainhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chainhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chainhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chainhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chainhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20End-to-End%20Trust%20in%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Is the Future of DevOps DaaS?](https://devops.com/is-the-future-of-devops-daas/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
