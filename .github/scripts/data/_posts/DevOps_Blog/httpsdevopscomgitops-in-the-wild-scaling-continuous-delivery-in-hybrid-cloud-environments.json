Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nGitOps in the Wild: Scaling Continuous Delivery in Hybrid Cloud Environments\n\nOver the last 10 years, software delivery has undergone a significant transformation. Continuous integration and continuous delivery[(CI/CD)](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd) procedures, in conjunction with infrastructure as code (IaC), have become the backbone of modern DevOps pipelines. Yet, as organizations grow into hybrid and multi-cloud environments, these approaches are often unable to keep up with the complexity of distributed systems, regulatory constraints and team autonomy. This is where [GitOps has come into the spotlight](https://devops.com/from-legacy-to-gitops-a-roadmap-for-enterprise-modernization/) as a powerful paradigm for managing infrastructure and applications. At its core, [GitOps is an extension of DevOps principles, which treats Git not only as a code repository but as the single source of truth for declarative system state](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops)s. With automated reconciliation between desired and actual states, GitOps promises consistency, auditability and speed in environments where drift and misconfiguration are constant risks. It allows developers to deploy confidently while providing operations teams with better guardrails and observability. While some early adoption has shown promising results, adopting GitOps on a broader scale ‘in the wild’ has brought up new challenges. Running GitOps at enterprise scale — across multiple teams, regions and cloud providers — requires more than just tools like ArgoCD or Flux. It requires a delicate balance in architecture, governance, security and cultural change. This post examines how organizations can go beyond proof-of-concept approaches to successfully scale GitOps in hybrid cloud environments. Based on real-world practices and emerging patterns, we’ll investigate the opportunities, pitfalls and strategies for achieving continuous delivery at scale — where Git is no longer a version control system, but the backbone of reliable, compliant and resilient software operations.\n\n### What is GitOps Really?\n\nGitOps is also called IaC with Git, but in reality, it is much more. GitOps is based on applying software engineering principles, e.g., version control, code review and automated testing, to infrastructure and operations. Rather than operating configurations using imperative scripts or ad hoc commands, companies store the desired system state (applications, infrastructure, policies) in Git repositories. Based on them, specialized GitOps controllers, such as [ArgoCD or Flux](https://ferrishall.dev/flux-cd-vs-argo-cd), can continuously bring the realized environment in line with the specified state. When a deployment drifts or fails, the controller attempts to bring it back to compliance automatically, which makes Git the source of truth in its entirety for both infrastructure and workloads. This model minimizes human error and provides a clean audit trail, rollbacks and reproducibility, which are essential in current compliance and rapid-movement environments.\n\nThe difference between GitOps and traditional [CI/CD](https://devtron.ai/blog/gitops-vs-traditional-cicd-devtron-modern-approach/) is the control location and the manner in which the delivery occurs. Under standard pipelines, CI/CD tools inject changes into environments, which may need high permissions, service accounts or manual involvement. GitOps inverts this approach — environments invert the state they want out of Git — and the deployment is consistent, verifiable and not tied to sappy external pipelines. This change is insidious but potent — it dissociates the delivery mechanism itself with tooling in the center and puts operational intelligence in its own right. To developers, GitOps implies a standard process of commanding, examining and unifying, which results in automatic deployment. It offers operators more powerful guardrails and a single mechanism to operate distributed systems in Kubernetes clusters, hybrid clouds or edge environments.\n\n### The Case for GitOps in Hybrid Cloud\n\nThe hybrid cloud has become a new reality for many enterprises, intentionally or accidentally. Regulatory compliance usually restricts sensitive workloads from staying on-premises, whereas cost savings and scalability cause other workloads to be transmitted to public clouds. Moreover, acquisitions, regional data residency legislations and changed business demands combine piecemeal IT environments across more than two providers and platforms. It is widely known that managing application delivery is difficult in such environments — teams must align multiple deployment models, security policies and operational practices and ensure that systems are compliant and resilient. Single-environment, traditional CI/CD pipelines are effective when confined to single environments — but fail when they are extended to heterogeneous infrastructures where multiple governance requirements conflict.\n\nHere’s how GitOps offers an attractive benefit. When [Git is used as the sole source of truth, and declarative definitions](https://zuplo.com/learning-center/what-is-gitops) are used to define infrastructure and applications, GitOps generates a consistent operational pattern that is platform-independent. Regardless of whether a workload is running on either AWS, Azure or Google Cloud, or on bare metal, the workflow of deploying and managing it appears the same: Update the Git repository and have GitOps controllers reconcile the changes. Such consistency not only lowers teams’ learning curve but also minimizes the risk of misconfiguration in the environment, where the differences between platforms are a frequent source of outages. For organizations with a hybrid or multi-cloud strategy, GitOps guarantees that governance, security and compliance policies can be coded centrally and applied uniformly across distributed environments.\n\nIn addition to consistency, GitOps also comes with the critical basics of [resilience](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/gitops-build-infrastructure-resilient-applications) and auditability, which are crucial in a hybrid cloud. Drift detection ensures that the environments are continuously audited to their specified state and are immediately visible when configurations change manually, when there is trouble or during security events. The rollback is simple — a Git revert puts the system back in an understandable condition, no matter what cloud or cluster the workload is hosted on. In any industry where audit and compliance reporting are standard, Git history offers a record of all changes in operations that can be verified and have a time stamp. Such traceability is hard to provide with ad hoc pipelines but naturally appears with the use of Git as the backbone operational framework. In hybrid cloud environments, where the risk is more on the surface, GitOps provides efficiency and promises governance, compliance and trust.\n\n[![VMware at KubeCon NA 2025](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kubecon-banner_dark-Version-A-600x300-.jpg)](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2025/10/13/vmware-by-broadcom-at-kubecon-north-america-2025/)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLotLY1RC8HouuSff0OQJQP9ex0k0xLVqj)\n\n### Challenges of Scaling GitOps\n\nAlthough the benefits of GitOps are evident, it does not take much time to realize the complexities of extensive team-based or pilot project-based scaling. Operation design at scale is one of the initial challenges. Organizations are faced with the question of whether to implement monorepos that allow better visibility but introduce bottlenecks, or multi-repos that introduce additional governance overhead and enhance team autonomy. Access control between or among repositories, clusters and teams cannot be managed efficiently, and this is especially significant in controlled industries. GitOps comes with new dependencies, too: Availabilities in Git, branch-protection regulations and pull-request processes directly impact deployment pipelines. This can make developers frantic without proper planning and slow delivery timing. Besides, there is still an unequal maturity of tools. However, applications such as ArgoCD and Flux are potent; with the possibility of multi-cloud failure, policy practices and centralized observability are being developed. This burdens businesses with building so-called custom solutions, adding to their existing workload.\n\nThe GitOps scale issues connected with security and culture are equally important. To transfer the deployments into Git workflows, developers, operators and security teams must work together differently. Developers must get comfortable with infrastructure-as-code and Git-driven release procedures, and operators need to have faith in automated reconciliation instead of human intervention. Resistance tends to arise in cases where roles and responsibilities are not decoded. Security is another crucial issue: Since control is centralized in Git, repositories and access tokens become a valuable target. Their protection needs robust role-based access control (RBAC) policies, secret management systems (e.g., Vault or Sealed Secrets) and techniques such as signed commits and image verification. Simultaneously, the fact that the concept of GitOps implies that everything is constantly reconciled might increase the number of mistakes if a wrong configuration is fused, making Git the single point of failure. These dangers stand out in particular. In contrast, GitOps offers an effective delivery platform; to expand it to a hybrid cloud, one must use tools and invest in governance, culture and security.\n\n### Strategies for Success\n\nSimple tool adoption is not enough to successfully scale GitOps in hybrid cloud environments; it involves considerate architectural designs that balance autonomy and control. The hub-and-spoke model is a time-tested model, characterized by the fact that a central repository (the so-called hub) controls global configurations, policies and security standards. Still, individual teams use application-specific repositories (the so-called spokes). The model enables organizations to implement minimum guardrails, including cluster networking policies, rules or compliance requirements and allows teams to run their delivery workflows. Another good course of action is to divide GitOps into infrastructure and application. Having separate repositories and pipelines between foundational infrastructure (clusters, networking, storage) and application deployments helps organizations increase complexity and eliminate accidental cross-impact between infrastructure and application changes.\n\n![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture1-10.png)\n\nFigure 1. Hub-and-Spoke Design\n\nAs evident in Figure 1, in the [hub-and-spoke](https://www.infotech.com/research/ss/considerations-for-a-hub-and-spoke-model-when-deploying-infrastructure-in-the-cloud) design, the hub is the central control plane for connectivity, security and governance and the spokes host distributed workloads. Communication runs through the hub for easy management and compliance. Applied to GitOps, the hub is the central Git repository alongside GitOps controllers (such as ArgoCD and Flux) serving as the single source of truth. Spokes are dispense environments — clusters, clouds or edges — that reconcile the state with the hub. This way, consistent deployments, centralized policy enforcement and observability can be achieved, while each spoke can be operated autonomously. This makes it easier to scale GitOps across multiple hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\n\nRepository design is also another crucial aspect. Monorepos provide clients with a single perspective for all environments, which is easy to audit and see. Still, they can rapidly grow in complexity, using dozens of teams and thousands of services. Multi-repo approaches, on the other hand, give more distinct boundaries and ownership at the cost of being fragmented in the absence of strong governance. Different companies use a mix of the two: Monorepos on infrastructure components, which must be global, and multi-repos on application teams, which appreciate autonomy. Regardless of the organization structure, there should be defined branching strategies, pull-request templates and an approval workflow that is in line with the compliance requirements. Another essential part is [drift detection](https://sprinto.com/blog/policy-drift-detection/), which includes automated notifications and dashboards tracking configuration drift across clusters, helping teams identify issues early and minimize mean time to recovery (MTTR).\n\nGovernance and policy-as-code are needed to scale GitOps. Policies and their usage, security and compliance can be codified with tools such as Open Policy Agent (OPA) using either Gatekeeper or Kyverno. These policies are pre-flight checks so that only the compliant manifests reach production clusters. Policy checks allow governance to be set up as an automated, repeatable process, not a manual bottleneck embedded in GitOps workflows. Policy-as-code can offer a malleable way to apply localized rules without breaking international norms in hybrid environments where regulatory specifications exist in each region. Moreover, organizations can add cost-consciousness to policies, which can ensure that scaling decisions do not go against FinOps practices.\n\nAnother requisite for success is observability. GitOps pipelines reveal metrics of interest to developers as well as the site reliability engineering (SRE) and compliance groups. Primary indicators comprise the frequency of reconciliations, drift events, failed deployments and rollback numbers. Working with GitOps controllers, Prometheus (as illustrated in Figure 2) and OpenTelemetry enables teams to gain real-time visibility into the status of delivery processes. Dashboards can represent deployment pace, error budgets and commercial conformity in various clusters and clouds. This is essential in hybrid cloud usage where operation blinds are prevalent. In combination with alerting systems, observability ensures that issues are addressed and that the problem does not turn into a wave of outages.\n\n![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture2-2.jpg)\n\nFig 2. Prometheus Monitoring Architecture\n\nThe diagram shows the Prometheus monitoring architecture, one of the core tools often used with GitOps and OpenTelemetry for observability. Prometheus servers gather metrics from exporters or jobs by scraping them directly or using the Pushgateway for short-lived jobs. The data flows into [Prometheus’s time series database (TSDB)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/devops/prometheus-monitoring/), which is made available via an HTTP server. Service discovery (e.g., Kubernetes) is a mechanism for dynamically identifying monitoring targets. Metrics can then be queried via PromQL, visualized in Grafana or the Prometheus web UI and exported through APIs. Alerts are routed through Alertmanager to tools such as PagerDuty or email to provide real-time insights into deployments, reliability and compliance across hybrid clouds.\n\nSecurity hardening should not be disregarded. By putting control of operations in Git into one point of trust- and accordingly, a potential point of failure. Enterprises should apply intense RBAC rules in Git files and clusters, and keep confidences encrypted and under the security of HashiCorp Vault, Sealed Secrets or SOPS. They should incorporate cryptography in committing and containerizing image signatures using solutions such as Sigstore or Cosign. These practices block attacks and unauthorized modifications in supply chains. More importantly, teams must incorporate safe defaults into GitOps processes, like the need to approve any production change more than once, so that automation increases security, as opposed to avoiding it.\n\nScaling GitOps is also more of a cultural process than a technological one. Code developers, engineers and security developers need to adapt to the new deployment model triggered by Git commits and not by manual processes or one-off scripts. This change demands an investment in training and onboarding, along with a blameless culture that promotes experimentation and learning from failures. GitOps processes that fail must undergo regular postmortems by the teams to improve systemic aspects instead of promoting blame. In the long run, it becomes a way of developing trust in the model, boosting adoption and giving developers the ability to take ownership of the delivery without compromising governance and reliability for the operators.\n\nWhen combined, these strategies bring a key reality out to the fore — that GitOps at scale is not a kind of silver bullet — but a disciplined set of techniques encompassing architecture, governance, observability, security and culture. By exploring GitOps, organizations can realize the value of continuous delivery in hybrid cloud contexts, and not only enhance consistency and efficiency, but also resiliency and compliance on an enterprise scale.\n\n### Case Study: GitOps at Scale\n\nTo demonstrate how GitOps may be used in a real-world hybrid cloud setup, we will consider the case of FinServe Global. This fictitious financial services company operates in North America and Europe but represents a real-world organization. Like several regulated businesses, FinServe had to contend with two dimensions: Updating its delivery pipelines and complying with rigid compliance and data residency standards. To address regulatory requirements, the company had a significant physical presence in regional data centers, and at the same time used AWS and Azure to scale and innovate. Fragile deployment practices had increasingly become a substantial barrier by 2021; a subset of teams was using Jenkins pipelines as custom, while others were using Ansible scripts and some were deploying using their fingers. This inconsistency hindered the speed of delivery and generated audit headaches and operational risk.\n\nThe breaking point was reached because a compliance audit revealed inconsistencies between the data center environment configuration and cloud deployments. FinServe retaliated by piloting a GitOps platform (with ArgoCD to deliver applications and Flux to manage infrastructure) before their platform engineering team. A hub-and-spoke repository pattern was developed: A cluster repository characterized by global networking, security and compliance criteria, and each product group had its own repository of application manifests. Open Policy Agent was used to implement policies for enforcing resource limits, encryption standards and network rules and meeting regulatory requirements. Secrets were founded on HashiCorp Vault and watched directly on GitOps. This isolation of concerns enabled platform engineers to provide guardrails while developers deployed applications.\n\nObservability was an expensive investment in successfully implementing GitOps. The team combined ArgoCD and Flux with Prometheus and Grafana, allowing for the development of dashboards that monitored all clusters’ reconciliation statuses, drift detection and deployment success rates. These dashboards were also gradually made essential for monitoring operations and proving compliance at audits. As an example, the auditors could access specific Git commits related to any change in production and time-stamped approval records. Such transparency reduces the manual work needed in preparation for clearing regulatory reviews.\n\nCultural change is also equally important. The new workflow was initially unwelcome among developers who saw GitOps as an extra burden to their existing CI/CD. To facilitate the change, the platform team launched developer enablement classes and designed templates, which streamlined the deployment practices without compromising flexibility. Early victories (e.g., shorter rollback) and fewer on-call incidents contributed to confidence-building. During the 12 months, pilot teams implementing GitOps increased to more than 40 product teams with more than 500 microservices in their hybrid context.\n\nThe results were tangible. Deployment frequency also improved by 35% and the MTTR was reduced by about 50%. Most importantly, audit preparation took less than a week, and was reduced to a few days, courtesy of the version history of Git and the policy enforcement mechanism coming into play. FinServe also stated that configuration-related incidents declined as drifts were easily identified before entering production.\n\nFinServe’s experience highlights that GitOps is not merely an upgrade in tooling but an organizational change. By integrating architectural discipline, policy-as-code governance, good observability and cultural investment, the company could simultaneously scale GitOps in a hybrid cloud setup and accomplish more speed, compliance and resilience.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGitOps has become a swiftly advancing pattern rather than a developing practice, offering a compelling framework for delivering software in non-trivial, distributed conditions. Being the sole source of truth in Git and performing the reconciliation of the desired and actual states partially automated makes hybrid cloud operations consistent, auditable and reliable, where traditional pipelines fail to deliver the needed consistency, auditability and reliability. However, in addition to the pursuance of ArgoCD or Flux, success at scale is not achieved by chance, but by intentional modifications in architecture, governance, observability and security, supported by cultural change.\n\nCompanies investing in these foundations can deploy faster, reduce operational risk and become highly compliant, enabling developers to gain more autonomy. Automation of delivery is not the only goal of GitOps in the wild; it is an endeavor of building trust between systems and teams. It is a viable combination of tools and an avenue to stabilize and scale software functionality for businesses in today’s hybrid cloud age.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environmentshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environmentshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environmentshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environmentshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environmentshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environments%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environments%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environments%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environments%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgitops-in-the-wild-scaling-continuous-delivery-in-hybrid-cloud-environments%2F&amp;linkname=GitOps%20in%20the%20Wild%3A%20Scaling%20Continuous%20Delivery%20in%20Hybrid%20Cloud%20Environments%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Chronosphere Adds AI Remediation Guidance to Observability Platform](https://devops.com/chronosphere-adds-ai-remediation-guidance-to-observability-platform/)\n\n[How Hyperconnected AI Development Creates a Multi-System Secret Sprawl »](https://devops.com/how-hyperconnected-ai-development-creates-a-multi-system-secret-sprawl/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
