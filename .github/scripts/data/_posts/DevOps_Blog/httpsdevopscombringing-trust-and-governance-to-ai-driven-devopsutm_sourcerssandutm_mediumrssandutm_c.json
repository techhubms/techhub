Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nBringing Trust and Governance to AI-Driven DevOps\n\nAt swampUP 2025 in Napa Valley, Alan Shimel sat down with three industry leaders whose companies sit at the heart of today’s AI-driven DevOps transformation: Rahul Tripathi, general vice president and GM of ITSM at ServiceNow; Justin Boitano, vice president of enterprise AI at NVIDIA; and Shlomi Ben Haim, co-founder and CEO of JFrog.\n\nTripathi, only months into his role at ServiceNow, stressed the importance of grounding product strategy in lived practitioner experience. Having led DevOps teams himself, he emphasized that ITSM remains the “bread and butter” of ServiceNow, but AI integration is reshaping expectations for productivity and security across IT operations.\n\nBoitano reflected on NVIDIA’s long journey from pushing CUDA adoption in 2008—when many thought GPU computing was a stretch—to today, where GPUs and AI frameworks have become central to enterprise computing. He noted that partnerships with companies like ServiceNow and JFrog are critical to building out the ecosystem, particularly as organizations look to infuse AI into every layer of their development lifecycle.\n\nBen Haim underscored the urgency behind what he called “AI FOMO.” With board-level pressure driving 40% of CIOs to expand AI budgets, enterprises are rapidly embedding AI into software supply chains. For JFrog, that means positioning itself as the “system of record” for DevOps, launching new platforms like JFrog Fly to simplify AI agent adoption while strengthening governance, traceability and security.\n\nTogether, the panel painted a picture of an industry balancing excitement with pragmatism. AI agents may not replace developers anytime soon, but they are already changing workflows, tooling expectations, and the economics of software delivery. As the panelists made clear, success will depend less on hype and more on how well organizations align AI adoption with trust, verification, and long-term resilience.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOpshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbringing-trust-and-governance-to-ai-driven-devops%2F&amp;linkname=Bringing%20Trust%20and%20Governance%20to%20AI-Driven%20DevOps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« OpenTelemetry Extensions to Enable Observability of AI Agents](https://devops.com/opentelemetry-extensions-to-enable-observability-of-ai-agents/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
