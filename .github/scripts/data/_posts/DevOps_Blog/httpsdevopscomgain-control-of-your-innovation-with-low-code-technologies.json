Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nGain Control of Your Innovation With Low Code Technologies\n\nAs an entrepreneur and CEO of a large global company, I once believed that building an exceptional business technology infrastructure meant creating it entirely from scratch. To me, software coding and development were processes that demanded immense specialized skill, consumed significant time and incurred substantial costs — precise, yet never agile.\n\nThat’s why I was so impressed to [discover low-code technology](https://devops.com/scaleups-are-turning-to-low-code-to-build-modern-internal-app-ecosystems/) — a sophisticated approach to software development for applications and systems, which delivers remarkable speed and flexibility. It can be implemented with minimal hand-coding, leveraging visual interfaces and drag-and-drop functionality, enabling professionals with limited technical expertise to build applications more efficiently.\n\nThanks to low-code technology, you can assemble unique systems using high-quality, pre-engineered components, much like advanced Lego bricks. Instead of working from scratch, you simply snap together ready-made components to define workflows and connect various elements of a system, even adding custom code when needed to adapt to your business needs.\n\nStudies suggest that low-code technology can help achieve up to a 90% reduction in development time compared to traditional coding methods. Again, you don’t need to know how to make the Legos — just how to put them together.\n\nOur global team at RunMyProcess, a cloud-based platform for low-code application development, builds robust business tools — customer portals, internal dashboards and tailored workflows — in days or weeks, not months. Our experts quickly bring solutions to life, freeing clients’ teams from complex challenges.\n\nThis approach also allows for broader participation, enabling more team members to contribute to progress through technology, driving innovation and fostering deeper collaboration. More importantly, low-code technology empowers businesses to turn ideas into functional applications, bringing products and services to market faster. You no longer have to risk your IP while navigating a complex, time-consuming process to reach the market. With low-code technology, you can transform an idea into a reality faster than ever before.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nToday, having a collection of brilliantly built elements is one thing, but making them work together seamlessly is another. That’s where orchestration transforms operations. Envision your entire business as a grand orchestra, with distinct sections such as sales, finance and operations, each playing its part in sync.\n\nWithout a conductor, each section might play its part independently, which means not performing as efficiently or productively as possible. A customer order comes in, the sales section acts and then someone manually cues finance, followed by operations. This chain of manual handoffs often results in delays and errors.\n\nIn real terms, effective orchestration relies on software platforms like RunMyProcess to automate and coordinate complex tasks across systems and departments. Our platform seamlessly merges human and AI data into a torrent of information. It eliminates wasted time and reduces errors that arise from manual coordination, making operations faster and more accurate.\n\nForget the intimidating jargon surrounding orchestration’s elaborate architectural patterns and other intricacies. At its core, the technology automatically ensures that every instrument, department and software system plays its part perfectly and in sequence.\n\nOur high-performance cloud platform has helped major retailers, manufacturers, insurance companies, agribusinesses and service providers streamline their processes, improving both speed and efficiency.\n\nFor example, a publisher burdened by manual edits, lost files and endless emails used the RunMyProcess DigitalSuite to automate workflows. This eliminated 200 hours of weekly busywork, cut article turnaround time in half and gave editors more time to focus on content quality.\n\nSimilarly, a global farm machinery manufacturer overcame slow, error-prone paper inspections by using RunMyProcess’ platform to create a custom digital check sheet. Within weeks, it accelerated quality control by 30%, improved inspection accuracy and gained real-time access to production data — enabling faster fixes and more consistent quality.\n\nBringing together the two tools creates a powerful synergy: Low-code accelerates application creation, and orchestration ensures those applications integrate smoothly across the entire organization. Ultimately, that combination helps companies control costs and manage complexity. While I’ve seen firsthand how these changes make a real difference, as with any construction project, thoughtful planning and skilled integration are essential to ensure everything fits and functions. Lego bricks and orchestra conducting work well as simplified images, but real-world integration is often more complex.\n\nStill, what truly stands out is how collaboration improves. It’s not just the tech folks at the forefront — people across the business can contribute. Processes become clearer, and it’s easier for everyone to get involved.\n\nIn the end, fusing low-code and orchestration is more than a technical upgrade. I see it as a business imperative and an empowering shift that is reshaping how leading companies get work done, and who takes the lead. It creates a foundation for resilience, agility and profitability — turning today’s innovations into tomorrow’s advantages.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologieshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologies%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologies%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologies%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologies%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgain-control-of-your-innovation-with-low-code-technologies%2F&amp;linkname=Gain%20Control%20of%20Your%20Innovation%20With%20Low%20Code%20Technologies%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Observe Adds Two AI Agents to Improve Observability](https://devops.com/observe-adds-two-ai-agents-to-improve-observability/)\n\n[Tabnine Adds Agents Capable of Automating Workflows to AI Coding Platform »](https://devops.com/tabnine-adds-agents-capable-of-automating-workflows-to-ai-coding-platform/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
