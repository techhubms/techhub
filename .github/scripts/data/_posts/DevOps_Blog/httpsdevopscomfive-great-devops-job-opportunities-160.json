Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nFive Great DevOps Job Opportunities\n\nDevOps.com is now providing a weekly DevOps jobs report through which opportunities for DevOps professionals will be highlighted as part of an effort to better serve our audience.\n\nOur goal in these challenging economic times is to make it just that much easier for [DevOps professionals to advance their careers](https://devops.com/devops-careers-report-examines-what-it-takes-sre/).\n\nOf course, the pool of available DevOps talent is still relatively constrained, so when one DevOps professional takes on a new role, it tends to create opportunities for others.\n\nThe five job postings shared this week are selected based on the company looking to hire, the vertical industry segment and naturally, the pay scale being offered.\n\nWe’re also committed to providing additional insights into the state of the DevOps job market. In the meantime, for your consideration.\n\n**Indeed.com**\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nOpenAI New York City [Client Platform Engineer](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=DevOps&amp;l=&amp;fromage=7&amp;sc=0kf%3Aattr%28CF3CP%29%3B&amp;from=searchOnDesktopSerp&amp;vjk=ec05913388eff14c) $255,000 to $325,000\n\n**Dice.com**\n\nDell Technologies Austin, TX [Principal Software Engineer](https://www.dice.com/job-detail/b0d4e04b-9c3b-48f9-82bc-2a4554b22ec7) $170,000 to $220,000\n\n**LinkedIn**\n\nJasper Remote [DevOps Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search-results/?currentJobId=4315880421&amp;distance=25&amp;eBP=NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_CHARGING&amp;f_TPR=r604800&amp;geoId=103644278&amp;keywords=DevOps&amp;origin=SEMANTIC_SEARCH_HISTORY&amp;refId=dyDE9uZS%2FFbblbLIOgwBEA%3D%3D&amp;trackingId=lKit9poKezpudqWKIYwS%2BA%3D%3D) $170,000 to $200,000\n\n**The Job Network**\n\nCTG Columbia, MD [DevOps Engineer](https://www.thejobnetwork.com/jobs?search=CTG+devops+engineer&amp;jobId=2147483647) $120,000 to $226,000\n\n**SimplyHired.com**\n\nViasat Carlsbad, CA [DevOps Engineer](https://www.simplyhired.com/search?q=DevOps&amp;jt=CF3CP&amp;t=7&amp;job=kuC5hWWr7zldVkp7DUiHidbuPI-ekA3085HJjgzJ5Xr3LjxFCAnsTQ) $111,500 to $208,000\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Ffive-great-devops-job-opportunities-160%2F&amp;linkname=Five%20Great%20DevOps%20Job%20Opportunities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Infrastructure as Code, Security Blind Spots, and the Messy Reality of DevOps](https://devops.com/infrastructure-as-code-security-blind-spots-and-the-messy-reality-of-devops/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
