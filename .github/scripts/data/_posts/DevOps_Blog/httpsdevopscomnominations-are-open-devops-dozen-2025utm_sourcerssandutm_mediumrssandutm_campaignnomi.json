Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nNominations Are Open: DevOps Dozen 2025\n\nOnce again, it’s that time of year when our community steps into the spotlight. [The DevOps Dozen](https://devopsdozen.com) is back — and nominations are officially open. If you’ve shipped something meaningful, mentored someone, elevated a team, or built the next great platform, this is your moment to share it with the world.\n\nOver the years, these awards have grown into a signal we can trust — honoring the people and products shaping how modern software gets built and run. This year’s program reflects where the market is headed, with deeper attention on AI, platform engineering, and the practical realities of secure software supply chains. There are [24 total awards](https://devopsdozen.com/#award-categories), split between **Community** and **Tools & Services** — a balance that celebrates both the humans who lead and the technologies that make them faster, safer and better.\n\n### **What’s New, What Matters**\n\nA few things to note up front. Community nominations remain open and accessible. For Tools & Services, there’s a $300 fee — not to ring a cash register, but to keep spam out and ensure we’re evaluating serious entries. If a commercial submission doesn’t make the finalist cut, the fee is refunded. We also cap finalists at 10 per commercial category to keep the field competitive and focused. And as always, final selection blends public voting (40%) with judges’ evaluation (60%) — a formula that balances community energy with experienced scrutiny.\n\n*Note: Tools/Services vendors aren’t eligible for three of the community awards — check each description for the fine print.*\n\n### **The Categories (All 24)**\n\n**Community Awards (9):**\n\n- [Top DevOps Community Evangelist](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/top-devops-community-evangelist/)\n- Most Innovative DevOps Open Source Project\n- DevOps Enterprise Leader of the Year\n- Best DevOps.com Article of the Year\n- [Best DevOps-Related Video or Audio Podcast](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/best-devops-related-video-or-audio-podcast/)\n- Best DevOps Survey/ Research/Report\n- Best DevOps Event of the Year\n- Best DevOps Book of the Year\n- Best Application of AI in Enterprise DevOps Practices\n\n**Tools & Services Awards (15):**\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n- Best Application of Agentic AI in a DevOps Tool/Platform\n- Best New DevOps Service Provider\n- Best New DevOps Tool\n- Best DevOps for DataOps/Database Solution\n- Best DevOps for Mainframe Solution\n- Best Testing Service/Tool\n- Best Platform Engineering Solution\n- [Best DevSecOps Solution](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/best-devsecops-solution/)\n- Best Observability Solution\n- Best Supply Chain Security Solution\n- Top DevOps Vendor Evangelist\n- Best Application of Generative AI in a DevOps Tool/Platform\n- Best End-to-End DevOps Platform\n- [DevOps Industry Leader of the Year](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/devops-industry-leader-of-the-year/)\n- Best DevOps Industry Implementation\n\nIf you’re scanning for what’s “new,” you’re not imagining it: [Agentic AI](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/best-application-of-agentic-ai-in-a-devops-tool-platform/) and [Generative AI](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/best-application-of-ai-in-devops-tool-platform/) each get their own category on the tooling side, and [Platform Engineering](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/best-platform-engineering-solution/) has a dedicated slot as this practice matures from trend to table stakes. Likewise, [Supply Chain Security Solution](https://devopsdozen.com/awards/best-supply-chain-security-solution/) earns standalone recognition — reflecting how software integrity, attestations and provenance moved from “nice to have” to “non-negotiable.”\n\n### **How it Works (and Why it’s Fair)**\n\nThe process is transparent and deliberate:\n\n- **Nominations**: Open to the public. For [Tools & Services](https://devopsdozen.com/tools-and-services-categories/), the $300 nomination ensures signal over noise. Community nominations remain free.\n- **Finalists**: We limit commercial finalists to 10 per category; if you don’t make it, your fee is refunded. Once finalists are set, public voting opens across all 24 categories.\n- **Winners**: Determined by a 40/60 blend—community vote (40%) and judges’ scores (60%). Finalists receive badges and recognition across the Techstrong network; winners receive trophies and the full spotlight they’ve earned.\n\n### **The Judges**\n\nEvery year, we assemble a panel that’s both broad in experience and sharp in judgment. This year’s [Honorable Judges:](https://devopsdozen.com/honorable-judges/)\n\n- **Alan Shimel** — CEO, Founder and Editor-in-Chief, Techstrong Group, Inc.\n- **Mitchell Ashley** — VP & Practice Lead, Software Lifecycle Engineering, Futurum\n- **Tracy Ragan** — OpenSSF and CDF Board Member\n- **Garima Bajpai** — Senior DevOps Leader and Advisor\n- **Ketan Jani** — Staff Site Reliability Engineer, Apple Inc.\n\nIt’s a strong mix of industry leadership, community credibility, and day-to-day operating reality — the combination you want when the mandate is to separate sizzle from substance.\n\n### **Dates You’ll Care About**\n\n- **Nominations**: Open now and run through mid-October (get yours in early; the best entries tell a crisp story with outcomes).\n- **Finalists**: Announced soon after; voting begins immediately thereafter.\n- **Winners**: Revealed at Predict 2026, our annual kickoff to the tech year — where trends and truth meet.\n\n### **Why These Awards Still Matter**\n\nDevOps has always been bigger than tools — and yet tools matter. Culture and process drive outcomes — and yet champions matter. The Dozen sit at that intersection. When a community evangelist rallies practitioners around a better way to ship, that changes outcomes. When a platform reduces toil and cognitive load, that changes outcomes. When we hold ourselves to higher standards in software integrity, that — again — changes outcomes.\n\nThat’s why we do this. Not for trophies, but for momentum. Not for vanity, but for validation. Not just to say “good job,” but to say “this is the work that moved us forward.”\n\nIf you’re reading this, you likely know who deserves a nomination: the unsung maintainer who shipped the fix at 2 a.m., the team that turned a monolith into a product platform, the product that finally made security guardrails feel like guardrails—not handcuffs. Tell us about them.\n\nNominations are open. Show the community what great looks like. Good luck to everyone who participates — and may the best DevOps win.\n\n### **Celebrating Noteworthy DevOps Dozen Winners (2020–2024)**\n\nYou can learn a great deal about the industry by [examining past winners](https://devops.com/meet-the-winners-of-the-2020-devops-dozen%C2%B2-awards/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
