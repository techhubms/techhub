Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nHow Graph Intelligence Is Transforming Software Supply Chain Visibility\n\nAt swampUP 2025 in Napa Valley, longtime JFrog collaborator and Java community veteran Stephen Chin talks about the evolution of software delivery, the fusion of graph intelligence with DevOps, and the growing need for integrated security across the software supply chain.\n\nChin, who has worn many hats across his career — from developer advocate to founder and now technologist working at the intersection of graph data and DevOps — has seen firsthand how the field has shifted since the first swampUP event a decade ago. What began as a small, casual gathering of early DevOps adopters has evolved into a global conversation about automation, AI and security at scale.\n\nIn his latest work, Chin is exploring how graph intelligence can be used to map and understand complex DevOps environments — from dependencies and artifacts to vulnerabilities and trust relationships. He described how visualizing these relationships in graph form gives teams a clearer view of their entire software supply chain, helping them detect risk patterns and respond to incidents faster.\n\nThe conversation turned toward what Chin jokingly dubbed “DevGraphIntelOps” — a synthesis of graph data, intelligence, and DevOps principles aimed at securing modern, AI-driven workflows. As organizations embrace agentic automation and complex multi-repository systems, understanding the connections between components has become mission-critical.\n\nReflecting on the past ten years of swampUP, Chin noted that while tools and trends have evolved, the core DevOps ethos remains the same: collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement. The next frontier, he said, will be about context and visibility — knowing not just what’s running in production, but how every component connects across the entire ecosystem.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibility%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibility%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibility%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibility%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility%2F&amp;linkname=How%20Graph%20Intelligence%20Is%20Transforming%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20Visibility%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Building Faster, Safer Pipelines Through Practical Automation](https://devops.com/building-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
