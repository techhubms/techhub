Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nEmpromptu Unveils Vibecoding Platform for Building Enterprise-Class Apps\n\nEmpromptu revealed today that it has made an artificial intelligence (AI) coding platform for rapidly building enterprise-class applications generally available.\n\nCompany CEO Shanea Leven said, unlike other so-called vibecoding platforms that provide a wrapper around a foundational AI model, the Empromptu platform is designed from the ground up to enable application developers to build enterprise applications that are designed to scale using a set of proprietary AI response optimization frameworks and backend services.\n\nThe Empromptu platform also provides retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language model operations (LLMOps) tooling to provide DevOps teams with a complete AI stack that provides the context engineering framework needed to optimize individual tasks and workflows, she added.\n\nAdditionally, the Empromptu platform also provides access to quality scores, AI output controls, and explainability of how decision-making was made as the application is developed. The SOC-2 compliant platform also provides integrations with payment systems and other existing business applications.\n\nCollectively, those capabilities ensure the output being generated also achieves 98% accuracy, compared to the 60 to 70% accuracy levels typically achieved by other vibecoding tools, said Leven.\n\nFinally, pricing for the Empromptu platform will be based on a predictable set of credits instead of a token-based pricing model that can lead to surprise bills as application developers continuously iterate applications, she added.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nThe overall goal is not just to use a natural language interface to rapidly craft a prototype of an application but rather to build a robust application affordably that can then be deployed in any production environment, including container platforms, without requiring a lot of AI expertise, she added.\n\nIt’s not clear how quickly application development teams are embracing vibecoding enabled by AI coding tools as an alternative to legacy low-code/no-code platforms. While those platforms have enabled application developers to build applications faster, the challenge is that many of them tend not to scale without additional coding efforts using lower-level languages such as Java. Rather than encountering those same issues using AI coding tools, Empromptu is making a case for a platform that addresses those issues as applications are initially built, said Leven.\n\nLess clear is to what degree the pace at which applications are being built and deployed might accelerate in the [age of vibecoding](https://devops.com/vibing-with-the-future-why-vibe-coding-is-the-next-big-wave-for-devops-and-ci-cd-teams/). In theory, the number of applications being created in the next few years could far exceed the number of applications built and deployed in the last decade. The challenge, of course, is not just building an application but also deploying and maintaining it in a production environment. As such, there is now a clear need for frameworks and platforms that make it possible to achieve that goal using vibecoding tools that can be easily embraced by both professional and so-called citizen developers alike. Of course, that also means that the number and types of application developers that any DevOps team is going to need to support is also about to exponentially increase in a way that existing pipelines and tooling are not designed to handle.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Appshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Appshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Appshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Appshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Appshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Apps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Apps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Apps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Apps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempromptu-unveils-vibecoding-platform-for-building-enterprise-class-apps%2F&amp;linkname=Empromptu%20Unveils%20Vibecoding%20Platform%20for%20Building%20Enterprise-Class%20Apps%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Perforce Adds Small Language Model to Create Synthetic Data for App Testing](https://devops.com/perforce-adds-small-language-model-to-create-synthetic-data-for-app-testing/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
