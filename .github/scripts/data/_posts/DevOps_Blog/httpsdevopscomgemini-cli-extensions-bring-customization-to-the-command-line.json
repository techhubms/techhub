Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nGemini CLI Extensions Bring Customization to the Command Line\n\nGoogle announced Gemini CLI extensions on October 8, 2025, three months after launching the [AI-powered command-line tool](https://devops.com/gemini-cli-the-open-source-ai-agent-thats-revolutionizing-terminal-workflows/). The extensions framework lets developers connect Gemini CLI to external tools without leaving the terminal.\n\nMore than one million developers are already using Gemini CLI. Now, they can install extensions from Google, as well as industry partners such as Dynatrace, Elastic, Figma, Harness, Postman, Shopify, Snyk and Stripe, along with the open-source community.\n\n### **How Extensions Work**\n\nExtensions are pre-packaged integrations that connect Gemini CLI to external tools. Each one includes instructions that teach the AI how to use the tool effectively. You don’t need complex setup procedures. Install an extension, and it works.\n\nThe installation process is straightforward: type “gemini extensions install” followed by a GitHub URL or local path. That’s it.\n\nExtensions build on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). While MCP provides the basic connection to a tool, extensions add context and intelligence. They include a “playbook” of tools and capabilities, like local scripts or third-party APIs. When you run a command, Gemini CLI checks this playbook and executes the right tool based on your environment context.\n\nUnder the hood, extensions can bundle MCP servers, context files, excluded tools and custom commands. This packaging makes them easy to distribute and install.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n### **Partner Extensions**\n\nThe launch partners represent a range of development needs:\n\n**Dynatrace** provides real-time application performance insights and root-cause analysis for faster debugging.\n\n**Elastic** connects to Elasticsearch data for developer workflows. It links directly to an Elastic MCP server in Elastic Cloud Serverless.\n\n**Figma** generates code from frames, extracts design context, and checks design system consistency with your codebase.\n\n**Harness** brings AI intelligence to CI/CD pipelines by analyzing execution data, surfacing cost insights and detecting failure patterns.\n\n**Postman** lets you manage collections and environments, evaluate APIs, and automate workflows through natural language.\n\n**Shopify** connects developers to Shopify’s ecosystem with tools for searching documentation, exploring API schemas and building serverless functions.\n\n**Snyk** integrates security capabilities into the development process to catch issues early.\n\n**Stripe** provides tools for interacting with the Stripe API and searching the knowledge base.\n\n### **Google-Created Extensions**\n\nGoogle built extensions for common developer tasks:\n\n- For cloud deployments, there’s Cloud Run (local code to live URL in one step), GKE (cluster management), gcloud (Google Cloud environment interaction), and Google Cloud Observability (troubleshooting).\n- For app builders, extensions include Code Review, Security (vulnerability detection), Google Maps Platform, Flutter, Chrome DevTools, Firebase and Genkit.\n- For generative AI and data work, there’s Nano Banana (image generation), Looker (data visualization), Data Cloud extensions for BigQuery and Cloud SQL, and MCP Toolbox for Databases.\n\n### **Finding Extensions**\n\nGoogle launched a Gemini CLI Extensions page where you can browse available extensions ranked by GitHub stars. The catalog includes community-built, partner, and Google-created options.\n\nThis open ecosystem means anyone can build and share extensions. That approach could lead to a wider range of integrations as the community grows.\n\n### **What This Means for DevOps Teams**\n\nExtensions address a real problem: Context switching. Developers typically jump between the terminal and various web interfaces throughout the day. Extensions bring those external tools into the command line.\n\nThe practical benefit depends on which tools your team uses. If you’re already working with Stripe’s API, having that access in the terminal could save time. The same applies to Figma, if you’re generating code from designs, or Elastic, if you’re analyzing logs.\n\nThe extension system is flexible. You can combine multiple extensions and create custom workflows to suit your specific needs. For teams with internal tools, you can develop proprietary extensions that work in conjunction with public ones.\n\n“Developer’s CLI tools continue to gain utility using AI,” according to Mitch Ashley, VP and practice lead, software lifecycle engineering, [The Futurum Group](https://futurumgroup.com/). What’s telling is the types of products included that extend work beyond code development to CI/CD, security, API management and observability. AI continues its impact across the SDLC.”\n\n### **Looking Ahead**\n\nThe success of Gemini CLI extensions will depend on what the community builds. Google provided the framework and initial set of partners, but the real test is whether developers create useful extensions that solve actual problems.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol provides a standard way to connect tools. Extensions make those connections easier to package and distribute. If the ecosystem grows, we might see extensions become a standard way to extend command-line tools.\n\nFor now, the extensions are available to try. You can browse the catalog, install a few that match your workflow, and see if they help. Some will be immediately useful. Others might need more development before they’re production-ready.\n\nThe framework is open-source, allowing you to build your own extensions if nothing meets your needs. Google provides templates and a step-by-step guide to get started.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Linehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Linehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Linehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Linehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Linehttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Line%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Line%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Line%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Line%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fgemini-cli-extensions-bring-customization-to-the-command-line%2F&amp;linkname=Gemini%20CLI%20Extensions%20Bring%20Customization%20to%20the%20Command%20Line%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Developer Experience: Overcoming 6 AI-Induced Challenges](https://devops.com/developer-experience-overcoming-6-ai-induced-challenges/)\n\n[Whose Ops is it Anyway?
