This beta feature provides full Model Context Protocol (MCP) client support, granting complete access to both read and write operations across your connected tools.\n\nBut here’s what you need to understand up front: this is powerful, and it’s dangerous.\n\n### **What Developer Mode Actually Does**\n\nDeveloper Mode turns ChatGPT into an MCP client. If you’re not familiar with MCP, it’s a protocol that lets AI models interact with external tools and data sources. Think of it as a standardized way for ChatGPT to talk to your other applications.\n\nWith Developer Mode enabled, ChatGPT can do more than read information. It can write, update, and delete data in your connected systems. That’s the power. It’s also the risk.\n\nThe feature is available to Pro, Plus, Business, Enterprise, and Education accounts on the web. You won’t find this in free accounts, and that’s probably intentional.\n\n### **Understanding the Risks**\n\nOpenAI is direct about this: Developer Mode is intended for developers who understand how to safely configure and test connectors. There are three main concerns you need to watch for.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nFirst, prompt injections. When you’re working with external data sources, malicious content could manipulate ChatGPT’s behavior. If your tool pulls in user-generated content or data from untrusted sources, that content could contain instructions that override your intentions.\n\nSecond, model mistakes in write actions. ChatGPT isn’t perfect. It can misunderstand instructions, format data incorrectly, or execute the wrong operation. When you’re dealing with write permissions, a mistake can destroy or corrupt your data.\n\nThird, malicious MCP servers. If you connect to an MCP server you don’t fully trust, it could attempt to steal information from your conversations or abuse the access you’ve granted.\n\nThese aren’t hypothetical risks. There are real concerns that developers need to take seriously before enabling this feature.\n\nMitch Ashley, VP and practice lead, software lifecycle engineering,[The Futurum Group](https://futurumgroup.com/) shares, “To quote Spider-Man Peter Parker’s uncle Ben, ‘with great power comes great responsibility,’ and that is equally true when using MCP servers. ChatGPT Developer Mode must be treated as a production integration surface, not a convenience feature.”\n\nMitch continues, “General recommendations when using ChatGPT Developer Mode are to scope permissions tightly, vet every connector, and design for failure with retries, rollbacks, and guardrails. Clear tool metadata and strict trust boundaries reduce misfires. And never rely on perfect user behaviors; build security and verification into the use of tools exposed through MCP.”\n\n### **Getting Started**\n\nEnabling Developer Mode is straightforward. Go to Settings, then Connectors, then Advanced, and toggle on Developer Mode. From there, you can add remote MCP servers in the Connectors tab.\n\nThe system supports SSE and streaming HTTP protocols. For authentication, you can use OAuth or run without authentication if your setup allows it.\n\nOnce your connectors are added, you can manage individual tools within each connector. Toggle tools on or off as needed, and refresh connectors when you update your MCP server to pull in new tools and descriptions.\n\n### **Making ChatGPT Use Your Tools**\n\nHere’s where things get tricky. ChatGPT won’t automatically know when to use your custom tools versus its built-in capabilities. You need to be explicit in your prompts.\n\nThe most reliable approach is to name the specific tool you want. For example: “Use the Acme CRM connector’s update\\_record tool to change the contact status.” When you’re working with write operations, this specificity isn’t just helpful—it’s essential.\n\nYou should also tell ChatGPT what *not* to use. “Do not use built-in browsing or other tools; only use the Acme CRM connector.” This prevents the model from falling back to its default behaviors when you need it to use your custom integration.\n\nIf you have multiple connectors that do similar things, set clear preferences. “Use CompanyDB for authoritative data; use other sources only if CompanyDB returns no results.”\n\nFor complex operations, specify the sequence. “First call Repo.read\\_file with the path. Then call Repo.write\\_file with the modified content. Do not call other tools.”\n\n### **Better Tool Descriptions Help**\n\nThe quality of your tool descriptions matters. When you set up your MCP server, write action-oriented tool names and descriptions. Include guidance about when to use each tool and when not to use it.\n\nAdd parameter descriptions and enums. This helps ChatGPT distinguish between similar tools, making it less likely to choose a built-in tool when your custom tool is the right choice.\n\nThink of tool descriptions as documentation for ChatGPT. The clearer you are, the better results you’ll get.\n\n### **The Safety Net**\n\nDeveloper Mode includes a confirmation system for write actions. By default, any tool that could modify data requires your approval before execution.\n\nYou’ll see the full JSON payload for each tool call. Review it carefully. Check that the parameters are correct, and the action matches your intent. Wrong inputs can lead to data loss or unintended changes.\n\nYou can choose to remember your approval for a specific tool within a conversation. Use this option only when you trust the underlying application completely. New conversations will require confirmation again.\n\nThe system respects the readOnlyHint annotation from MCP tool specifications. Tools without this hint are treated as write actions and require confirmation.\n\n### **Worth the Risk?**\n\nDeveloper Mode fills a real need for teams building custom integrations with ChatGPT. It gives you programmatic access to your tools without building a separate API layer.\n\nBut it requires discipline. Test your connectors thoroughly. Use explicit prompts. Review every write action. And only connect to MCP servers you trust.\n\nIf you’re not prepared to handle these responsibilities, stick with the standard ChatGPT experience. Developer Mode is a tool for developers who understand the stakes.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilitieshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fchatgpt-developer-mode-full-mcp-access-with-serious-responsibilities%2F&amp;linkname=ChatGPT%20Developer%20Mode%3A%20Full%20MCP%20Access%20with%20Serious%20Responsibilities%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Massive VS Code Secrets Leak Puts Focus on Extensions, AI: Wiz](https://devops.com/massive-vs-code-secrets-leak-puts-focus-on-extensions-ai-wiz/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
