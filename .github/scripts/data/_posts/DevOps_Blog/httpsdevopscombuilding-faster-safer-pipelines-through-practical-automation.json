Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nBuilding Faster, Safer Pipelines Through Practical Automation\n\nAt swampUP 2025, Alan Shimel spoke with Hariharan Ragothaman, a technologist and repeat attendee who has taken his passion for DevOps automation to the next level. While not a JFrog employee, Ragothaman has been a frequent participant in the JFrog community, first attending swampUP 2023 and returning this year to present a framework he developed to optimize infrastructure deployments.\n\nRagothaman’s project focuses on improving accessibility, security and speed in the deployment process—three areas that often compete for attention in enterprise DevOps environments. Using JFrog’s platform as a foundation, he built a framework designed to dramatically reduce the time it takes to bring new services into production without compromising on compliance or control. The result, he explained, is a more efficient, secure, and transparent pipeline that helps teams move from code to deployment faster and with greater confidence.\n\nWhat makes Ragothaman’s approach particularly compelling is its emphasis on practical, repeatable automation. By embedding quality checks and security policies directly into the framework, teams can accelerate delivery while maintaining strong governance. His work aligns closely with JFrog’s broader vision for end-to-end trust and automation across the software supply chain—a theme echoed throughout this year’s conference.\n\nBeyond his technical presentation, Ragothaman reflected on the collaborative spirit of swampUP, describing it as a unique space where practitioners can share real-world solutions and learn from one another. For him, the event isn’t just about product announcements—it’s about community, experimentation, and the drive to keep improving how software gets delivered.\n\nHis takeaway: innovation in DevOps doesn’t just come from platforms; it also comes from practitioners who use those platforms to reimagine what’s possible.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automationhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fbuilding-faster-safer-pipelines-through-practical-automation%2F&amp;linkname=Building%20Faster%2C%20Safer%20Pipelines%20Through%20Practical%20Automation%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Five Great DevOps Job Opportunities](https://devops.com/five-great-devops-job-opportunities-159/)\n\n[How Graph Intelligence Is Transforming Software Supply Chain Visibility »](https://devops.com/how-graph-intelligence-is-transforming-software-supply-chain-visibility/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
