Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nA Modern Approach to Multi-Signal Optimization\n\nIn modern cloud operations, we’re not just facing a data tsunami; we’re caught in a signal storm. An application’s throughput metric looks flat, but its underlying pod central processing unit (CPU) usage is spiking. A new deployment manifest is applied successfully via kubectl, but user latency is slowly creeping up. These signals are a mix of complementary and conflicting information, creating a confusing picture that paralyzes decision-making.\n\nThe problem isn’t the signals themselves, but our approach to them. We consider all metrics equally important, which leads to confusion. Without a framework, a spike in a pod’s CPU usage is given the same weight as a drop in user sign-ups. This lack of structure is the root cause of the analysis paralysis many engineering teams feel today.\n\nThis confusion has specific negative impacts. It leads to [slow incident response](https://devops.com/three-strategies-for-reducing-mttd-and-mttr-as-outage-costs-spiral/) (MTTR) as engineers waste time toggling between Grafana dashboards, Datadog traces and kubectl logs, manually trying to correlate conflicting signals. It also drives costly ‘best guesses’. When a pod begins restarting, the loudest symptom is a resource issue. Therefore, the reflexive action is to scale up behavior that contributes directly to the industry-wide 32% cloud waste statistic. Most importantly, you cannot build reliable automation on a foundation of chaotic, unclassified signals.\n\nTo escape the storm, we need a deliberate multi-signal optimization strategy. This strategy’s success hinges on a critical first step: Analyzing and classifying all signals into a logical framework. Only then can we build a solution that is not just fast, but also precise and cost-effective.\n\n### Creating Order with Metric Classification\n\nThe practical first step in this strategy is to organize the chaos. It’s how you make sense of the noise before you can act on it. We do this by implementing a framework called the signal hierarchy.\n\nOutcome metrics are the ‘what matters’ or ‘north star’ metrics. These define business and user success and are what you are solving for. They are always application-level indicators such as p99 latency, application error rates, cost per transaction or user conversion rates.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nPrimary metrics are the ‘external drivers’ or ‘causal signals’. These are independent events that act upon your system causing it to react. In the Kubernetes world, these include changes in user traffic from an ingress controller, application programming interface (API) requests per second, a code release or a configuration change or the trigger of a CronJob.\n\nSecondary metrics are the ‘internal symptoms’ or ‘diagnostic signals’. They show how the system’s infrastructure is responding to the primary drivers. These are the classic infrastructure metrics we’re all familiar with: Pod CPU and memory usage, network I/O and disk saturation.\n\nThe goal of this classification is to understand the role of each signal. This simple act of categorization allows a fix or a resolution to be found systematically and logically: It prioritizes negative changes in outcomes, looks for causes in primary signals, and uses secondary signals for evidence and diagnosis.\n\n### The Strategy in Action: From Classification to Correlation\n\nLet’s walk through how this multi-step strategy works in a real-world Kubernetes environment. Imagine a sudden, sharp increase in the p99 latency for an e-commerce checkout service running as a deployment.\n\nThe first step is real-time classification. As signals stream in from Prometheus, the Kubernetes API and CI/CD tools, it should go through a classification system to get classified appropriately. The p99\\_latency\\_spike would be tagged as an outcome. A pod\\_cpu\\_high metric would be tagged as a secondary. The other two signals are identified: A recent increase in api\\_requests\\_per\\_sec and a deployment\\_event from ArgoCD are tagged as primary. This classification system, which could be a static classifier or an ML-based classifier, provides an essential context for what comes next.\n\nWith signals now classified, we need an approach to correlate them. This process prioritizes the negative outcome (high latency) and immediately looks for a causal primary signal to explain it. Here, it finds the ‘bad deployment’ narrative: The p99\\_latency\\_spike (outcome) began shortly after the deployment\\_event (primary), which was followed by the pod\\_cpu\\_high metric (secondary). These three signals complement each other perfectly.\n\nHowever, what if the signals were conflicting? Imagine the latency is high (outcome), but pod CPU and memory are normal (secondary) and ingress traffic is flat (primary). The lack of complementary infrastructure symptoms is just as important. It tells the engine to correctly rule out a resource bottleneck in the service itself and widen its search for other primary causes such as the failure of a downstream API dependency.\n\nThe diagnosis is now based on a coherent, correlated story; not a single, noisy alert. In our first scenario, the system generates a precise operation — kubectl rollout undo — instead of the simplistic and costly kubectl scale deployment. This generated operation is then dispatched through a safety pipeline for verification before execution.\n\nThe result is that a precise and effective action was taken. The right action was taken because the system first classified the signals to understand their roles, then correlated them to find the true narrative.\n\n### Proactive Classification: Focusing on the Metrics That Matter\n\nThe signal hierarchy isn’t just a reactive tool for incident response. Its most profound impact comes from applying it proactively. For any given application, we can perform this analysis ahead of time, creating a focused model of what truly drives its behavior and performance.\n\nInstead of waiting for an issue, we can analyze a service’s telemetry landscape in a steady state. Out of the hundreds of metrics an application performance monitoring (APM) tool may expose for a single service, we can pre-identify the critical few. For our checkout service, this means defining that p99\\_latency and payment\\_error\\_rate are its core outcome metrics, and ingress\\_traffic and inventory\\_api\\_calls are its key primary drivers.\n\nThe immediate benefit is a dramatic improvement in efficiency. When an alert on an outcome metric fires, the system’s initial hypothesis formation is no longer a search across hundreds of potential signals. It begins with a much shorter, pre-validated subset of high-impact metrics, making the correlation step exponentially faster. But the true power of this pre-identified model is that it allows us to move beyond rapid reaction into the realm of prediction. By continuously monitoring anomalous patterns in the key primary and secondary drivers, the system can predict imminent issues and take corrective action before the user-facing outcome metric is impacted. This is the shift from firefighting to fire prevention.\n\nThis proactive approach also yields a powerful secondary benefit: Optimizing the observability stack itself. By identifying which metrics are truly causal and which are simply redundant or highly correlated symptoms, teams can make informed decisions to reduce their monitoring overhead. This allows you to potentially stop measuring, storing and paying for unnecessary telemetry without losing any meaningful visibility, thereby reducing the cost of your observability platform.\n\n### From Strategic Insight to Business Impact\n\nA disciplined multi-signal strategy is more than a technical improvement; it’s a direct driver of business value, moving organizations from costly reaction to profitable proaction. The impact of this strategic approach is clear, measurable and significant.\n\n- Crushing Cloud Waste: By strategically correlating traffic patterns (primary) with resource usage (secondary), we’ve found that over 60% of production workloads can be tuned for cost improvements of 20% or more.\n\n- Unlocking ‘Long Tail’ Savings: For the bottom 50% of an organization’s resources (such as staging and development environments), this strategy consistently yields average cost reductions of 30–40% by understanding usage schedules and dependencies.\n\n- Boosting Performance and Reliability: By automatically correlating negative outcomes to their primary triggers, root cause analysis becomes an instantaneous process. This is why our model leads up to 78% less application downtime.\n\nThe key to conquering modern cloud complexity isn’t another dashboard or another tool. It’s adopting a holistic strategy. This strategy must begin with the foundational step of classifying signals to create order from chaos. From this foundation of clarity, you can build powerful, intelligent automation that saves money, protects revenue and — most importantly — allows your engineers to focus on innovation.\n\nStop chasing individual signals in a storm of data. It’s time to adopt a multi-signal optimization strategy and let an autonomous engine turn that chaos into clear, actionable and profitable intelligence.\n\nKubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025 is taking place in Atlanta, Georgia, from November 10 to 13.
