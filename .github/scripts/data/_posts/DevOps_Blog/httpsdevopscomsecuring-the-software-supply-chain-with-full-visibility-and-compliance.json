Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nSecuring the Software Supply Chain with Full Visibility and Compliance\n\nAt swampUP 2025 in Napa Valley, JFrog’s Yossi Shaul, senior vice president of DevOps, joined Alan to reflect on both his personal journey and JFrog’s evolving role in shaping modern software delivery. Shaul has been with JFrog since its early days, starting with the creation of Artifactory nearly 16 years ago — before “DevOps” was even a recognized term. He recalled leading the Artifactory team, driving its adoption, and later stepping into architectural leadership before returning to oversee JFrog’s entire DevOps organization across product and engineering.\n\nShaul highlighted how much has changed since those early years. What began as a simple repository manager has grown into a platform that now touches nearly every aspect of software supply chain management. With the rise of AI, security concerns, and increasingly complex pipelines, the pressure on DevOps teams has only intensified. JFrog’s answer has been to expand beyond artifact management into governance, automation, and AI-driven workflows — all areas Shaul now helps drive.\n\nOne theme that stood out in the discussion was continuity. Shaul’s long tenure gives him a unique perspective on how JFrog has evolved with the industry — from open source beginnings to enterprise adoption, from managing binaries to securing supply chains, and now from human-driven workflows to AI-assisted delivery.\n\nShaul also emphasized the importance of listening to customer feedback. swampUP, he noted, is not just about unveiling what’s next but about validating that the technologies JFrog delivers address real-world challenges DevOps teams face daily.\n\nJFrog’s DNA remains rooted in DevOps, even as it pushes into the AI era. For Shaul, the mission is clear: build platforms that help teams deliver software faster, more securely, and with confidence at scale.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliancehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliancehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliancehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliancehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliancehttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliance%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliance%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliance%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliance%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fsecuring-the-software-supply-chain-with-full-visibility-and-compliance%2F&amp;linkname=Securing%20the%20Software%20Supply%20Chain%20with%20Full%20Visibility%20and%20Compliance%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Microsoft’s AI Agents Target Technical Debt Crisis](https://devops.com/microsofts-ai-agents-target-technical-debt-crisis/)\n\n[MLOps at Scale: How Community Is Driving AI Into Production »](https://devops.com/mlops-at-scale-how-community-is-driving-ai-into-production/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
