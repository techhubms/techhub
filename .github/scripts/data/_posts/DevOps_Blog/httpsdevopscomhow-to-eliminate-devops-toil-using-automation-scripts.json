Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nHow to Eliminate DevOps Toil Using Automation Scripts\n\nEngineering teams today are facing under-the-hood productivity killers that are affecting job satisfaction and work efficiency. These productivity killers are called toils. Toils are repetitive, manual, and mundane tasks that provide no long-term value to your application or infrastructure.\n\nToils are experienced in countless ways in modern development operations. It can be the daily routine of manually deploying code to various environments, or the weekly routine of restarting all services that should self-recover, or the monthly server patching of multiple machines that requires manual management, and the constant administrative headaches that could be prevented with properly managed scripts. All these practices share similar characteristics, which are that they’re manual, repetitive, and scale linearly with system growth.\n\nThe overtime accumulations and impact of these DevOps toils are more productivity impactful than what most organizations realize. [According to a recent survey](https://devops.com/survey-shows-mounting-devops-frustration-and-costs/), developers and DevOps professionals spend approximately 15 hours per week managing manual tasks such as debugging pipelines and waiting for tests and builds to complete. This represents nearly 40% of a typical work time that could be redirected toward innovation, system improvements, and strategic initiatives.\n\nThe solution lies in [script automation](https://cloudray.io/articles/script-automation-guide), rather than the ad-hoc processes that often create more problems than they solve in DevOps workflows. When strategic script automation is adopted as part of the DevOps workflow, it brings about a streamlined workflow that cuts down the repetitive, manual, and mundane tasks, which saves your team valuable time.\n\nThis article will show you a practical framework for eliminating DevOps toil through automation. You’ll learn how to find the highest impact automation opportunities, choose the right technical approach for your environment, and implement sustainable solutions that reduce long-term maintenance burden, not add to it.\n\n### The Strategic Advantages of Script-Based Automation\n\nThere are numerous approaches to solving DevOps toil, ranging from purchasing enterprise solutions to redesigning DevOps workflows. However, script automation gives the most practical and immediate actionable solution for most teams. Generally, scripts offer flexibility, accessibility, and direct implementation, which makes them the first choice to eliminate toils in DevOps workflows.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nScripts have several advantages over more complex automation solutions. First, they use existing knowledge of your existing team. Most DevOps professionals already know Bash, Python, or PowerShell, which can be leveraged on the fly without following the learning curve of specialized tools. Secondly, they can be implemented incrementally, so you can automate one process at a time rather than having to change the whole workflow. Thirdly, they’re transparent and debuggable, so maintenance and troubleshooting is easy even for team members who didn’t write the original script.\n\nMost importantly, scripts can address the specific quirks and edge cases in your environment. While commercial automation platforms force you to adapt your processes to fit their capabilities, custom scripts can be tailored to work exactly how your systems work, not how they should work.\n\nSuccessful script automation isn’t just about writing code that works. It’s about creating sustainable solutions that genuinely reduce long-term maintenance burden. The most effective automated solutions follow four core principles:\n\n1. **Idempotency:** Scripts should produce the same result no matter how many times they’re run. Running a deployment script twice shouldn’t create duplicate resources or system conflicts. This principle ensures scripts can be safely re-run during troubleshooting without creating more problems.\n2. **Observability:** Every automated process should provide clear feedback about what it’s doing and whether it succeeded. This means comprehensive logging, meaningful error messages, and status indicators that help operators understand system state without manual investigation.\n3. **Fail-Safe Design:** Scripts should be designed to fail gracefully and provide clear recovery paths. When something goes wrong and it inevitably will, the script should leave the system in a known, recoverable state rather than an undefined failure condition.\n4. **Documentation Through Code:** The best scripts are self-documenting, with clear variable names, logical structure, and embedded comments that explain not just what the code does, but why specific decisions were made.\n\nThe most successful automation initiatives begin with what industry practitioners call the “15-minute rule”. If a task takes longer than 15 minutes to complete manually and needs to be performed more than once per month, it’s an ideal candidate for script automation. This threshold ensures you’re targeting genuinely repetitive work while avoiding the trap of over-engineering solutions for infrequent edge cases.\n\nCommon examples of 15-minute rule candidates include database backup verification, log rotation and cleanup, service health checks, configuration file deployment, and security certificate renewal processes. These tasks are frequent enough to justify automation effort but simple enough to script successfully without extensive infrastructure changes.\n\nThe key insight here is that small, focused scripts compound their value over time. A five-minute script that saves 30 minutes per week represents a 156-hour annual time savings for your team. This time can be redirected toward strategic improvements rather than operational maintenance.\n\n### Choosing Your Automation Approach\n\nYour DevOps toil elimination success depends on choosing the right automation way for your environment and team. Don’t jump straight into scripting. Instead, take the time to evaluate your options to avoid costly mistakes and get sustainable solutions.\n\n**Language Selection Strategy**\n\n[Your scripting language](https://cloudray.io/articles/bash-vs-python) should align with three things: team expertise, infrastructure requirements, and long-term maintainability. The best teams standardize on one main language and allow exceptions for specific use cases. This way, you balance consistency with practical flexibility, so most team members can maintain and extend existing scripts and accommodate special cases.\n\n**Simple Scripts vs Orchestration Platforms**\n\nStart with simple, focused scripts that solve specific problems before going for a broader [orchestration solution](https://spacelift.io/blog/cloud-orchestration-tools%5C). A 20-line bash script that automates database backups provides immediate value and minimal maintenance. Orchestration platforms like Ansible or [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) are great for managing large infrastructures, but they introduce overhead that may not be justified for basic toil.\n\nThe decision point is often scope and complexity. If you’re automating tasks within a single system or a few servers, scripts are usually the way to go. If you need to coordinate activities across multiple infrastructures or manage complex dependencies, orchestration tools are more valuable.\n\n**Building for Your Team’s Reality**\n\nConsider your team’s current skills, time to learn new tools, and existing infrastructure constraints. The best automation way is the one your team can implement, maintain, and extend over time.\n\n### **Practical Implementation**\n\nMoving from theory to working solutions requires a systematic approach that gets quick wins while building towards toil elimination. The best implementations follow a structured methodology that minimizes risk and maximizes early value.\n\n**The 15-Minute Rule for Prioritization**\n\nStart by identifying tasks that take more than 15 minutes and occur at least monthly. These are your highest value automation targets—frequent enough to justify development time, complex enough to provide real relief. Common examples are log cleanup routines, service health checks, backup verification, and configuration deployments.\n\nDocument these tasks before automating them. Understanding the manual process completely prevents automation scripts from missing critical edge cases or error conditions that experienced operators know by instinct.\n\n**Essential Patterns**\n\nEvery automation script should follow four patterns. First, have a comprehensive success and failure log. Second, write scripts that can handle interruptions by either resuming cleanly or giving clear directions for how to recover. Third, validate the script achieved what it was supposed to before marking it complete. Fourth, include rollback for any script that modifies state.\n\n**Testing and Validation Framework**\n\nNever deploy automation scripts to production. Create isolated test environments that mirror production so you can test script behavior in realistic conditions. Start with dry-run modes that show what the script would do without actually running.\n\nBuild up your confidence by rolling out slowly, starting with non-critical systems and then moving on to production infrastructure.\n\n### Measuring Success and Scaling Up\n\nShowing the value of your automation efforts requires metrics that matter to both engineering teams and leadership. Focus on concrete improvements like time saved, errors reduced and system uptime rather than vanity metrics. For example, if automating database backups reduces a 45-minute manual process to 5 minutes of automated execution, that’s a 40-minute improvement per occurrence. Multiply that across daily, weekly or monthly to calculate total time recovered for your team. Also, monitor error reduction rates and incident response times as automated processes are more consistent and faster than manual ones.\n\nBeyond individual script performance, successful automation initiatives build momentum through cultural adoption. Survey your team about workload reduction and job satisfaction improvements – high-performing teams consistently report that automation allows them to focus on strategic projects rather than operational firefighting. Track team adoption rates of new automated processes and measure the time between identifying automation opportunities and implementing solutions as this will show your team’s automation maturity.\n\nOnce initial scripts are working, scale by expanding into adjacent processes and sharing successful patterns across teams. Create reusable script libraries that standardize common operations while allowing for customization for specific requirements. Establish automation guidelines to ensure consistency and maintainability as your script portfolio grows and create internal documentation so team members can build on each other’s automation work rather than starting from scratch each time.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\nDevOps toil doesn’t have to be part of your team’s daily grind. By identifying and replacing manual tasks with well-designed automation scripts you can free up a lot of time for more strategic work. Start small with simple, high-impact scripts that solve obvious pain points and then gradually expand as your team gets more comfortable. Remember, it’s not about automating everything; it’s about eliminating the toils that consume the most time and attention of your team.\n\nWhen done right, script automation becomes a force multiplier that not only eliminates toil but enables your team to tackle more complex problems and deliver more value to your organization.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhow-to-eliminate-devops-toil-using-automation-scripts%2F&amp;linkname=How%20to%20Eliminate%20DevOps%20Toil%20Using%20Automation%20Scripts%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Grafana Labs Extends AI Capabilities of Observability Platform](https://devops.com/grafana-labs-extends-ai-capabilities-of-observability-platform/)\n\n[Technical Debt: Make Developers Happier Now or Pay More Later »](https://devops.com/technical-debt-make-developers-happier-now-or-pay-more-later/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
