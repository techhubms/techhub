Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nHashiCorp Embraces Agentic AI to Streamline Management of IT\n\nHashiCorp today added a slew of updates to its platform for managing and securing IT infrastructure, including integration with multiple automation frameworks and a preview of an ability to use artificial intelligence (AI) agents to provision infrastructure as code (IaC).\n\nAnnounced at the [HashiConf 2025](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/conferences/hashiconf), the unit of IBM will this week showcase Project infragraph, which lays the foundation for adding AI agents to the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).\n\nKyle Ruddy, senior director of product marketing for HashiCorp, said AI agents should make its unified control plane for provisioning, securing and managing IT infrastructure more accessible to members of IT teams that today have varying levels of programming expertise.\n\nAt the same time, HashiCorp is making it easier to integrate HCP with third-party automation frameworks, including the Ansible framework provided by sister IBM company Red Hat and frameworks from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft, to streamline workflows both before and after workloads are deployed.\n\nIn the future, HashiCorp plans to extend the reach of the AI agents it is building to provide integrations with Red Hat Ansible and OpenShift, IBM watsonx Orchestrate, Concert, Turbonomic and Cloudability platforms to further streamline IT management workflows.\n\nIn the meantime, HashiCorp is extending its infrastructure lifecycle management (ILM) and security lifecycle management (SLM) platforms. For example, HCP Terraform Stacks, a framework, makes it simpler to organize and deploy multiple, interdependent Terraform configurations as a single entity is now generally available.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nHashiCorp in beta is also adding HCP Terraform search to make it simpler to quickly discover IT infrastructure resources and, if needed, import them in bulk to HCP. There is also the HCP Terraform actions tool available that promises to automate and streamline Day 2 infrastructure operations by codifying them alongside the code used to provision infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, there is now also a beta instance of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that will make HCP more accessible to AI agents, along with an HCP Packer tool that provides visibility into software builds of material (SBOMs) that can be stored in an SBOM storage platform that is now generally available.\n\nOn the SLM front, HashiCorp is making available in beta an HCP Boundary RDP credential injection tool that secures Windows remote desktop protocol (RDP) sessions and a HCP Vault Radar MCP server to enable AI tools to analyze infrastructure and application environments for leaked secrets and sensitive misconfigurations.\n\nThere is also available in beta HCP Vault Dedicated, a tool for secrets inventory reporting, which will be followed by the release of Vault Enterprise 1.21 to automate cryptographic workflows, manage post-quantum readiness, and enforce zero-trust controls using new application programming interfaces (APIs) and capabilities.\n\nFinally, HashiCorp is generally making available HCP Vault Radar Jira SaaS scanning (GA) and a set of plugins for integrated development environments (IDEs) that are available in beta.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to make it simpler for IT teams to both automate workflows in ways that make [IT environments fundamentally more secure](https://devops.com/trend-micro-survey-finds-lack-of-it-security-input-in-devops-introduces-cyber-risk-for-72-of-companies/), says Ruddy. The challenge, as always, is lashing together all the frameworks required to achieve that goal.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IThttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IThttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IThttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IThttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IThttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IT%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IT%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IT%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IT%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fhashicorp-embraces-agentic-ai-to-streamline-management-of-it%2F&amp;linkname=HashiCorp%20Embraces%20Agentic%20AI%20to%20Streamline%20Management%20of%20IT%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Chainguard Adds Curated Repository to Secure JavaScript Libraries](https://devops.com/chainguard-adds-curated-repository-to-secure-javascript-libraries/)\n\n[Living Security Unveils HRMCon 2025 Speakers as Report Finds Firms Detect Just 19% of Human Risk »](https://devops.com/living-security-unveils-hrmcon-2025-speakers-as-report-finds-firms-detect-just-19-of-human-risk/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
