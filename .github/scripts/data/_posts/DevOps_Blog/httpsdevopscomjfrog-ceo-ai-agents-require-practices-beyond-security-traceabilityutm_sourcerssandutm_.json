When he asked attendees to raise their hands if they already had AI embedded in their software supply chains, nearly everyone responded affirmatively. “If you don’t, you can leave the room,” he said to laughter.\n\nBen Haim called JFrog “the system of record for your software supply chain” amid daily attacks on software infrastructure.\n\nTo that end, JFrog unleashed a slew of [announcements](https://devops.com/jfrog-unveils-devops-platform-for-the-agentic-ai-era/) Tuesday. It launched JFry, a DevOps platform that simplifies AI agent integration for application developers working at scale. Built on Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP), JFry connects with popular development tools including Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude Code, allowing DevOps teams to centrally manage software components through semantic metadata while optimizing release deployments and integrating with package managers and GitHub repositories.\n\nThe company has introduced AI agents that automatically remediate software vulnerabilities by applying real-time policy analytics during code development. Alongside this, JFrog launched its AppTrust platform, which serves as a unified hub for governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) teams. Supporting this ecosystem, JFrog has established the Evidence Ecosystem through AppTrust partnerships with GitHub, ServiceNow, SonarQube, Akuity, Akto, Coguard, Dagger, Nightvision, Shipyard, and Troj.ai.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang

JFrog has overhauled its AI model catalog with a new Secure Model Registry that enables governance policy enforcement and cost tracking across multiple models.\n\nBen Haim was joined onstage by several executives whose companies partner with JFrog.\n\nSonar CEO Tariq Shaukat predicted that while much will change with AI adoption, core principles will remain constant. “It’s never been about how fast developers type on a keyboard,” Shaukat said, advocating a “trust, but verify” approach to AI-generated code. “We’re helping with that verification step as software is being written,” he said.\n\nServiceNow General Vice President Rahul Tripathi, drawing from his experience running large DevOps teams, emphasized the tension between speed and security. “Nobody wants to receive a notification that our software was breached,” he said. “It’s about getting IT Ops moving at the speed of DevOps.”\n\n“Trust, but verify, or ‘Vibe then verify.’ We’re helping with that verification step as software is being written,” Shaukat added.\n\nJustin Boitano, vice president of enterprise AI at ServiceNow, said his company’s approach to scaling AI development, revealing that CEO Jensen Huang had challenged the team to double chip production, which could only be achieved by “infusing AI across our lifecycles.” Boitano noted that performance-optimized models can achieve double or triple token efficiency improvements.\n\nWhen Ben Haim asked whether AI would replace human developers, Boitano downplayed the concern. “I think that’s over-hyped,” he said. “We see it as improving productivity across the board.”\n\nThe discussion underscored the industry’s focus on balancing AI adoption with governance and security concerns as organizations navigate the rapidly evolving technological landscape.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceabilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceabilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceabilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceabilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceabilityhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceability%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceability%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceability%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceability%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fjfrog-ceo-ai-agents-require-practices-beyond-security-traceability%2F&amp;linkname=JFrog%20CEO%3A%20AI%20Agents%20Require%20Practices%20Beyond%20Security%2C%20Traceability%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[«
