Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nAIOps for SRE — Using AI to Reduce On-Call Fatigue and Improve Reliability\n\nSite reliability engineering (SRE) has become an emergent niche practice invented at Google to become a foundation of contemporary enterprise performance worldwide. With the continued growth of microservices, a multi-cloud infrastructure and continuous deployment pipelines adopted by organizations, the operational surface area has increased to the extent that human personnel cannot monitor and manage it in real time. The effectiveness of distributed systems has compounded their complexity, such that traditional monitoring, alerting and incident response are no longer effective.\n\nThis complexity brings about a side effect, which is alert fatigue. There is an enormous torrent of sporadic, redundant, intractable and downright fake notifications of on-call engineers. Rotations 24/7, with escalation links excessively burdened, have already overstretched teams and demoralized the staff, promoting burnout. Under this scenario, human judgment has become a bottleneck instead of a defense mechanism since cognitive overload slows the decision-making process and compromises incident response. The practices of SRE, such as maintaining a high rate of innovation and stability simultaneously, are more challenging to maintain as most of the staff is occupied with operational toil.\n\nHere is where[AIOps](https://devops.com/how-aiops-is-revolutionizing-devops-monitoring-in-the-cloud-era/) (artificial intelligence for IT operations) comes into the picture. As Gartner defines AIOps as the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to optimize the work of IT, it introduces such advanced features as anomaly detection, event correlation, predictive insights and automatic remediation. This is not a substitute for human expertise but an additional feature to the SRE teams: Reducing noise, bringing out actionable indicators and refocusing attention on high-value engineering work.\n\nThis article will discuss how AIOps can be used by SREs to alleviate on-call exhaustion and enhance system reliability. It will analyze the problem area, unpack the pragmatic application of AI/ML to the SRE process, emphasize the practical examples and comment on the challenges and prospects.\n\n### The Problem Space: On-Call Fatigue in SRE\n\nThe core of SRE is the on-call model — a rotating approach in which engineers must respond 24/7 to any incident. The mechanics are simple: Incidents are identified by monitoring systems, escalated by a paging or chat-based alert and resolved based on a documented runbook or a make-it-up investigation. However, this is not a simple step. Escalation trees imply that one unresolved alert can trickle down through several levels of engineers, all of whom were taken out of intensive work or sleep. Eventually, this pattern of upheaval is disastrous for productivity and health.\n\nThe high number of false positives and low-value alerts is one of the most urgent issues. Modern observabilities create massive telemetry; without enlightened filtering, providers get inundated with thousands of reports daily. According to a survey by [PagerDuty (2021)](https://spike.sh/blog/pagerduty-review-for-incident-management/), most incident responders have over 10 alerts per shift, and most said that they could not be acted on. The outcome is alert fatigue, wherein engineers grow used to the notifications, leading to the danger of missing the most critical signals when they are the most needed.\n\n[![VMware at KubeCon NA 2025](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kubecon-banner_dark-Version-A-600x300-.jpg)](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud-foundation/2025/10/13/vmware-by-broadcom-at-kubecon-north-america-2025/)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLotLY1RC8HouuSff0OQJQP9ex0k0xLVqj)\n\nRepeated laboring is also troublesome, with incidents that have no final system solution. Google’s SRE book describes [toil](https://sre.google/workbook/eliminating-toil/) as manual, repetitive, automatable labor that increases linearly with the growth of services. The same problem that on-call engineers may experience night after night could be a repetitive memory leak, a one-time API crash, a cranky monitoring threshold or similar issues. Every repetition takes away attention and makes the feeling of futility even stronger.\n\nThese situations cause human bottlenecks in peak outages. Manual triage and system correlation overload the responders when several systems fail simultaneously. Critical minutes are wasted, and the question is how to decide whether it was 50 alerts of one root cause or 50 discrete issues.\n\nIt is significant in terms of human cost. A [2025 report](https://www.catchpoint.com/learn/sre-report-2025#:~:text=Introduction%20Welcome%20to%20the%20seventh%20edition%20of,SRE%20%28%20Site%20Reliability%20Engineering%20%29%20survey.) by Catchpoint lists almost 70% of SREs, indicating that on-call stress impacted burnout and attrition. Chronic sleep disturbance, constantly switching between contexts and psychological stress, damages not only the well-being of an individual but also the work of the team and the reliability on a large scale.\n\n### What is AIOps and Why Now?\n\nAIOps was a term Gartner initially popularized. It refers to using ML and sophisticated analytics on the data of IT operations to enhance event correlation, anomaly identification and root cause analysis. As a practitioner, though, AIOps will be less about the use of marketing terms and more about addressing a particular operational truth: Humans are simply incapable of operating on the size and speed of the systems of today. AIOps to SREs constitutes a set of AI- and ML-based methods that achieve impedance matching, indicate patterns that cannot be seen by human eyes and allow proactive operations instead of reactive ones.\n\nAIOps has four main [capabilities](https://www.selector.ai/blog/aiops-in-2025-4-components-and-4-key-capabilities/). Anomaly detection detects log, metric or trace abnormalities, which can be used to indicate incidents. Event correlation broke the events into single incidents to create fewer pages that do not inundate on-call engineers. Predictive analysis uses past data to predict possible outages or performance declines to alert customers before they are affected. Lastly, auto-remediation will undertake available runbooks or coordinate corrective measures without manual intervention and maintain the stability of services as SREs concentrate on high-order engineering.\n\n![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture1-6.png)\n\n*Figure 1. AIOps main capabilities*\n\nThere is no coincidence in the timing of the adoption of AIOps. Architectures based on the cloud produce unprecedented amounts of telemetry, whether short-lived containers or microservice connections. With the current ML developments and real-time data processing, it is now possible to analyze these streams in real time, and insights can be revealed within seconds instead of hours. In the meantime, companies feel the ever-increasing pressure of providing greater availability and reliability with no corresponding increase in the number of SREs. This compounding factor continues to drive automation as an essential but not extraneous feature.\n\nAlthough traditional monitoring is stationary-based with high static thresholds and manual triage requirements, AIOps systems are[learned](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/11/2102)and adaptable. They do not signal at each CPU spike, rather than just the exception, they put them into perspective, coordinate and expand the exception across layers and suggest or take action. In the case of SREs, this shift is a transition to more strategic (mission-based) and intelligence-augmented (to a greater degree) reliability engineering practice instead of reactive firefighting.\n\n### Applying AIOps to SRE Practices\n\nThe great potential of AIOps to SRE does not lie in its abstract definitions but in its direct assurance of practices in everyday operations. AIOps transform the incident lifecycle by tackling historic causes of toil, including noise, detection delays, slow diagnosis and manual repairs. The five tangible areas where it provides quantifiable value are presented below.\n\n1. Noise Reduction & Event Correlation\n\nThe most apparent irritant of SREs is the deluge of alerts provided by monitoring systems. The CPU spike in one microservice will cascade into the downstream latency warning, database connection error and end-user timeouts, generating dozens or even hundreds of unnecessary alerts. Without AIOps, an engineer must manually correlate relationships across pages, meaning no system is designed to handle high stress.\n\nAIOps platforms use a method of clustering and deduplication to reduce these to a single coherent incident. AI can automatically detect links between related events by analyzing the metadata containing the time, topological dependencies and historical co-occurrence. Consequently, the number of alerts is reduced, and they have more context. As a real number, it may imply transforming 1,000 raw events into one actionable event with causal chains attached. In the case of on-call engineers, this directly converts into reducing pages, less exhaustion and less time to respond.\n\n1. Anomaly Detection & Early Warning\n\nThe old methods of monitoring use hard-coded thresholds: CPU exceeding 80%? Page the team. However, distributed systems hardly ever act in linear, foreseeable fashions. Technically correct functional alarms may occur in seasonal traffic bursts, short-lived load tests or warming up a cache. AIOps proposes using statistical and ML-based anomaly detection, in which normal behavior is dynamically trained on logs, metrics and traces. As opposed to set thresholds, models identify the delicate differences between what is expected to be the case. This allows it to give early alerts (before service-level objectives (SLOs) are violated).\n\nAn example of this is an incremental change in [99th percentile](https://controlplane.com/community-blog/post/4-tips-to-improve-p99-latency) latency that could be undetected by conventional systems until it is enacted by user degradation. Trends can be detected at an earlier hour, and anomaly detection can alert the teams so that they can take the initiative. The alteration of reactive firefighting to preventative action is radical. Anomalies can be surfaced during working hours when they are less disruptive, instigating engineers to wake up at 2 a.m. because a customer-impacting incident transpired.\n\n1. Root Cause Analysis Acceleration\n\nIdentifying the actual root cause can be the most time-consuming procedure when an incident has occurred. Dependency tracing through manual methods is a titanic undertaking in microservices, where one user request could pass through dozens of services. It is common to waste minutes or hours of critical time perusing dashboards, cross-checking logs and speculating on possible hypotheses by the engineer.\n\nAIOps systems have the potential to speed up a root-cause analysis with the use of graph-based algorithms and ML models on service associations. Analyzing the data on historical incidents and the current telemetry can allow you to propose the root cause with confidence scores. An example is where the latency warning of several services keeps being correlated with the memory pressure in a particular cluster of the cache. The AI can instantly identify the probable location as the cluster.\n\nThis does not eliminate human validation but reduces the time to insight. Engineers do not have to work with a blank slate because a set of hypotheses supported by evidence is provided as a starting point, and the mean time to resolve (MTTR) is significantly minimized.\n\n1. Predictive Incident Management\n\nAIOps has the strongest ability to look ahead and is the most compelling. It can predict system degradation before it occurs by training predictive models using past performance, seasonal usage and infrastructure measurements.\n\nTake the case of an e-commerce platform going into the holiday shopping season. Under modern traffic patterns and resource consumption patterns, AIOps may indicate that a database cluster will become congested in the next two hours. Other scaling actions can be proactively taken, or SREs can be notified to take preventive measures by the system rather than waiting till the inevitable event of an outage occurs. This foresight lens transforms the operations from reactive due to the need to fight fires all the time and the reliability-first strategy. It concerns minimizing downtime and generating trust that should systems be subjected to the rarely observed demand spikes they would not be catastrophic.\n\n1. Automated Runbooks & Self-Healing\n\nAutomation is the final promise of AIOps. There are many known solutions to incidents: Restart a service, delete a cache or turn around a certificate. Conventionally, these are recorded on runbooks that the engineers run manually.\n\nAIOps can execute runbooks automatically so that some types of incidents invoke a predefined workflow or script. For instance, when a service starts failing consistently because it has been discovered there is a memory leak, the system can just do a safe restart without alarming an engineer. More sophisticated applications proceed to self-healing systems, where repairing decisions are made dynamically (dependent on incident context). The key here is balance. Complete automation is potentially dangerous, particularly in novel or high-stakes incidents. Most mature organizations use a human-in-the-loop approach, whereby automation is used to deal with routine, complex or uncertain situations under the supervision of engineers. The result is a decrease in unnecessary wakeups and more significant engineering work.\n\n![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Picture2-3.png)\n\n*Figure 2. AIOps maturity spectrum from reactive to proactive incident management*\n\n*Use Cases*\n\n1. Walmart’s [AIDR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16887) — Anomaly Detection for Incident Response at Scale\n\nWalmart’s AI Detect and Respond (AIDR) project offers a remarkable viewpoint on scaling AIOps in a large and heterogeneous operational environment to decrease the on-call load and significantly enhance reliability. The proposed AIDR is an AI-driven anomaly detection platform aimed at maintaining the health of the business and the system in real time across Walmart’s applications, platforms and teams.\n\nDuring three months of validation, AIDR implemented over 3,000 models supporting more than 25 business, platform and ops teams. In the same period, it reported approximately 63% of the major incidents and an average decrease of more than seven minutes in mean time to detect (MTTD).\n\n*Table 1. Results and metrics*\n\n| Metric | Improvement | | --- | --- | | [Mean time to detect (MTTD)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16887) | Reduced by more than seven minutes on various major incidents | | Coverage of major incidents | ~63% of major incidents covered by AIDR in the test/validation period | | False positives and noise | Lowered compared to prior methods (including static thresholds) due to the models + rules hybrid approach |\n\nArchitecturally, AIDR relies on univariate and multivariate ML models, statistical models and rule-based fixed thresholds. This hybrid technique enables the maintenance of domain-specific constraints (through rules) and uses adaptive models that acquire baseline models and automatically identify variations.\n\nTo maintain long-term performance, AIDR incorporates a feedback loop: Feedback on the quality of the alerts (true vs. false positives) is provided by the teams, and drift detection is included in the system to detect instances of poor performance and cases of change in input distribution. The self-onboarding is also present: Different teams possessing different degrees of ML knowledge can input their metrics/signals into AIDR, model them and be deployed.\n\nIn terms of output other than raw MTTD, AIDR’s impact was also significant in curtailing noise (many alerts are removed or muted vs. legacy rule-based or hard threshold-based alerts) and amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal of on-call engineers. It has generated previous identification of occurrences that would otherwise be realized only after customer exposure.\n\n2. Cambia Health Solutions — [Alert Correlation](https://www.bigpanda.io/customer/cambia-health-solutions-case-study/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) & Noise Reduction with BigPanda\n\nCambia Health Solutions is a nonprofit health services organization with a severe problem of alert overload and manual triage of incidents. Their legacy monitoring systems emitted various alerts, and many emerged as redundant or were not contextualized, causing delayed responses and high operational expenses. To eliminate such problems, Cambia deployed the AIOps platform developed by BigPanda that employs ML to correlate and enrich alerts, converting them into actionable incidents.\n\nCambia significantly enhanced their network operations centre (NOC) operations by integrating BigPanda:\n\n1. Less Alert Noise: The high level of correlation generated by BigPanda’s advanced correlation engine eliminated irrelevant alerts, and the noise level was also significantly reduced.\n2. Enhanced Alert Enrichment: Contextual data, including host names and CI/CD pipeline data, was added to alerts, offering insight to the NOC teams.\n3. Automated Incident Management: Close to [83%](https://www.bigpanda.io/customer/cambia-health-solutions-case-study/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) of the alerts were automatically handled and did not require manual intervention.\n4. Better SLA Compliance: The NOC reached its service level agreements (SLAs) compliance 95% of the time, and critical alerts were recognized within 30 seconds of occurrence.\n\nSuch improvements enabled Cambia’s NOC team to prioritize quickly resolving real incidents, increasing system reliability and customer satisfaction.\n\nThe table presented below lists the most critical performance indicators of Cambia before the adoption of BigPanda and following it:\n\n*Table 2. Metrics and BigPanda*\n\n| Metric | Before BigPanda | After BigPanda | | --- | --- | --- | | [Alert Noise Reduction](https://www.bigpanda.io/customer/cambia-health-solutions-case-study/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | High | Low | | Percentage of Automated Alerts | 0% | 83% | | SLA Compliance | 70% | 95% | | Time to Identify Critical Alerts | 30 minutes | 30 seconds |\n\n### Challenges and Limitations of AIOps in SRE\n\nAlthough AIOps has transformative potential in the SRE teams, its adoption is challenged. Data quality has become the inherent bottleneck: ML models and anomaly detection algorithms can only be as good as the data being fed. False positives, missed events or a direct inflection of automated behavior may occur due to inconsistent, incomplete or noisy data. This is why the cliche of [garbage in, garbage out](https://profisee.com/blog/garbage-in-garbage-out/) applies.\n\nIt is also essential to trust and explain. Most SREs are wary of using AI insights, especially when models propose remedial procedures without explicit reasoning. The hidden nature of black-box predictions may destroy trust, and teams may disregard this information or confirm every suggestion by hand, thereby reducing the productivity benefits.\n\nThe other practical limitation is integration complexity. Current observability stacks are diverse combinations of monitoring solutions, logging systems and CI/CD pipelines. To ensure data integration, exact similarity in event schemes and end-to-end incident context, retrofitting AIOps must be carefully planned.\n\nThere is also organizational and cultural resistance. The teams might feel that AI will diminish human judgment, impacting employment by reducing the number of people employed, slowing the adoption process and creating a clash between engineers and management. Moreover, overheads such as costs and resources to manage pipelines in ML (such as compute, storage and staff) can be substantial, particularly in smaller companies.\n\nThe key principles of overcoming these challenges have to do with incremental adoption: Begin with low-risk automation (e.g., alert correlation), keep human-in-the-loop validation, ensure that data are strongly governed and ensure the message about AI is that the latter is an augmentation and not a replacement. A gradual trust-establishment process will make SRE teams understand that productivity and reliability benefits are achieved without losing confidence in operational stability.\n\n### Future Directions and Emerging Trends\n\nThe AIOps in SRE on the next frontier assumes smart augmentation instead of automation. Among the recent trends is the emergence of SRE AI copilots, which have been developed and implemented within ChatOps. Engineers may use such copilots during a live incident to summarize alerts, prescribe remediation actions or point out impacted services. It is a 24/7 operational partner that can help lessen the cognitive load on engineers.\n\nGenerative AI (Gen AI) is also starting to enter incident postmortem, where a summary, timeline and root cause hypothesis are constructed out of telemetry and logs without human intervention. These systems make incident analysis faster, more efficient and error-free since the documentation is at least consistent and fast due to codifying knowledge based on previous incidents.\n\nContinuous learning systems are also becoming popular. These systems are dynamically configured to respond to changing system behavior, continuously learning normal behavior and anomalies to improve their thresholds, correlations and predictive models. This adaptable model will ensure that AIOps will be helpful as systems become more intricate, with model drift minimized and actionable information preserved.\n\nLastly, AI is also being used in chaos engineering and resilience testing. AI can be used to make SREs proactively monitor services that anticipate the systems to respond to failures and highlight latent vulnerabilities before any actual incident happens. All these trends combined indicate a future in which AI can alleviate the toil and suggest SREs into more resilient self-optimizing systems.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAIOps is one of the paradigm shifts in SRE, which changes how teams handle complex distributed systems. Using AI and ML, SREs can minimize alert noise, speed up anomaly creation and root cause analysis and automate repetitive remediation efforts. These capabilities directly respond to the endemic issues of on-call fatigue, burnout and operations bottlenecks, enabling engineers to devote their time to high-value problem-solving activities rather than solving problems by hand.\n\nThe practical applications, such as the alert correlation improvements in Cambia Health Solutions and the AIDR predictive monitoring in Walmart, prove the improvements in reliability, efficiency and well-being among the teams. Nonetheless, some challenges such as data quality, trust, integration complexity and cultural resistance remain. These risks can be avoided through careful and gradual implementation, along with human-in-the-loop validation to achieve the potential benefits of AIOps.\n\nUltimately, AI augments the future of SRE: Systems that learn, adapt and proactively ensure reliability would allow engineers to be more strategic and tactical in creating a resilient, self-healing infrastructure than they think they can be now, and act as responders instead of architects.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0https://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Faiops-for-sre-using-ai-to-reduce-on-call-fatigue-and-improve-reliability%2F&amp;linkname=AIOps%20for%20SRE%C2%A0%E2%80%94%C2%A0Using%20AI%20to%20Reduce%20On-Call%20Fatigue%20and%20Improve%20Reliability%C2%A0%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« DevSecOps in Practice: Closing the Gap Between Development Speed and Security Assurance](https://devops.com/devsecops-in-practice-closing-the-gap-between-development-speed-and-security-assurance/)\n\n[MIT Researchers Propose a New Way to Build Software That Actually Makes Sense »](https://devops.com/mit-researchers-propose-a-new-way-to-build-software-that-actually-makes-sense/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
