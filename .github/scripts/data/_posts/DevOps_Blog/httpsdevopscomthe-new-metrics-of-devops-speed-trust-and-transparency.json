Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nThe New Metrics of DevOps: Speed, Trust and Transparency\n\nAt swampUP 2025, Alan sits down with Aman Sardana and Vijay Kumar Soni to talk through one of the defining challenges of modern software delivery—how DevOps practices must evolve to accommodate the growing influence of artificial intelligence across the software development lifecycle. They explore the intersection of automation, security and scalability as organizations rethink their pipelines to handle AI-driven workloads and agentic development patterns.\n\nThe rapid integration of AI into coding, testing, and deployment workflows has significantly accelerated release velocity, but it has also increased complexity. Traditional CI/CD models are now being stress-tested by AI-generated code, model deployment requirements, and the need for continuous governance. The emerging consensus is that future-ready DevOps teams must combine automation with observability, policy enforcement, and risk management — effectively treating AI systems as first-class citizens within the software pipeline.\n\nThey also address the growing need for explainability and traceability as AI systems become embedded into infrastructure management and application delivery. Teams can no longer rely solely on deterministic systems; instead, they must design feedback loops that account for dynamic, probabilistic outcomes generated by AI. This requires enhanced collaboration between platform engineers, data scientists, and security teams to ensure consistency and reliability.\n\nUltimately, there’s a new reality for DevOps: speed alone is no longer the primary benchmark of success. In the AI era, the goal is responsible acceleration — maintaining trust, transparency, and control even as automation and AI agents transform how code, infrastructure, and models move from design to production. The next generation of DevOps will be defined not only by how fast organizations can deliver, but by how intelligently and securely they do it.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparencyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparencyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparencyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparencyhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparencyhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparency%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparency%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparency%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparency%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-new-metrics-of-devops-speed-trust-and-transparency%2F&amp;linkname=The%20New%20Metrics%20of%20DevOps%3A%20Speed%2C%20Trust%20and%20Transparency%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Opsera Adds AI Agent Capable of Analyzing Quality of Code Generated by AI Tools](https://devops.com/opsera-adds-ai-agent-capable-of-analyzing-quality-of-code-generated-by-ai-tools/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
