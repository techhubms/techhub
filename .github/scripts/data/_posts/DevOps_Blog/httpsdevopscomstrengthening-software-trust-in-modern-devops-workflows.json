Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nStrengthening Software Trust in Modern DevOps Workflows\n\nAt swampUP 2025 in Napa Valley, Alan Shimel sat down with Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, and Gal Marder, EVP of Strategy at JFrog, for a discussion on how partnerships across the DevOps and AI ecosystems are reshaping the way software is built, secured and delivered.\n\nShaukat emphasized that Sonar’s relationship with JFrog is rooted in shared values around trust, transparency, and code quality. As AI continues to accelerate software creation, both companies see a growing need for solutions that help developers not only move faster but also maintain the highest levels of security and reliability. “It’s never been about how fast developers type,” Shaukat noted. “It’s about ensuring that what’s being built is safe, verifiable, and ready for production.”\n\nThe discussion also touched on the rising influence of AI in DevOps workflows and the responsibility that comes with it. Shaukat and Marder agreed that as teams adopt AI tools to generate, test, and deploy code, governance must evolve to keep pace. That’s where the partnership between Sonar and JFrog becomes especially relevant—bridging code integrity with artifact management, vulnerability detection, and software supply chain security.\n\nMarder added that this collaboration exemplifies JFrog’s broader strategy to build a unified, secure DevOps ecosystem powered by trusted partnerships. Together, Sonar and JFrog are working to redefine how software quality and trust are measured in an era where AI agents, automation, and human developers all share the same pipeline.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflowshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflowshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflowshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflowshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflowshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflows%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflows%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflows%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflows%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fstrengthening-software-trust-in-modern-devops-workflows%2F&amp;linkname=Strengthening%20Software%20Trust%20in%20Modern%20DevOps%20Workflows%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Secure Governance and Scalable Management for AI Models](https://devops.com/secure-governance-and-scalable-management-for-ai-models/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×\n\nExecutive Security as a Strategic Priority\n\nStep 1 of 8\n\n12%\n\nWhich best describes your level of influence on cybersecurity, risk and/or data protection in your organization?(Required) I make decisions about or have influence over cybersecurity strategy\n\nI make decisions about or have influence over risk strategy\n\nI am responsible for protecting data at my organization\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions that protect the PII of employees and customers\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to underpin our cybersecurity strategy\n\nI am responsible for building and/or implementing solutions to manage and mitigate risk\n\nOther/NA\n\nHave you or members of your family or other executives and members of their families been targets of social engineering attacks?
