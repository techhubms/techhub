Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nThe Cloud Reset: DevOps Brings Workloads Back to Private Clouds\n\nMany DevOps teams are hitting the reset button and rebalancing their use of public versus private clouds after a decade of “public cloud-first” strategies.\n\nRecent[research](https://www.vmware.com/docs/private-cloud-outlook-2025) reveals that 69% of enterprises are considering moving workloads from public cloud back to private environments. DevOps teams’ desire for greater control, security and cost predictability is largely driving this shift. Indeed, 92% of IT leaders say they trust private cloud more for security and compliance needs than public cloud\n\nThe [shift to private cloud](https://devops.com/30-minutes-private-cloud/) is very DevOps-driven. This is because all stakeholders can benefit. DevOps teams benefit from the private cloud’s stability and how existing or future investments in on-premises infrastructure are complemented and maintained. With the benefits cloud computing offers (automation, scalability and self-service), DevOps teams are better able to manage security and meet compliance needs, especially when data sovereignty is concerned. Additional benefits for the business DevOps stakeholders include how private cloud can help reduce rapidly rising public cloud costs.\n\n### Learning from a Decade of Public Cloud\n\nThe lessons learned in the public cloud space over the past few years are key. Public cloud platforms are agile and scalable, but they often present unpredictable costs and [data governance issues](https://devops.com/protecting-data-public-cloud-hybrid-cloud-2/). Most companies admit that at least some of their public cloud budget is wasted, and almost half believe that at least a quarter of their cloud spending is lost to inefficiencies.\n\nCost unpredictability has surfaced as a major concern. Most companies acknowledge that at least some of their public cloud budget is wasted, and nearly half believe that at least a quarter of their cloud spending is lost to inefficiencies. What began as a promise of “pay only for what you use” often led to surprise bills from unforeseen usage spikes, data transfer costs and complex pricing models that made budgeting nearly impossible.\n\nEqually significant are concerns over security and data control. While public cloud providers offer robust security features, many organizations struggle to navigate the shared responsibility model and the complexities of managing security across multiple cloud environments. More leaders believe that private or hybrid cloud environments better meet stringent security requirements and provide them with direct oversight of critical data. For industries with strict compliance mandates, having complete control over data location and access has become non-negotiable.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n### The Evolution, Not Abandonment, of Cloud Strategy\n\nThis shift doesn’t signify a failure of cloud computing or a return to traditional on-premises infrastructure. Instead, it illustrates a maturation of cloud strategy. Organizations seek the same cloud benefits, such as automation, self-service provisioning and scalability, but within a more predictable and accountable operational model.\n\nPrivate clouds have advanced considerably since the early days of virtualization. Modern private cloud platforms now provide the same cloud-native capabilities that made public clouds appealing: containerization, microservices architecture, DevOps tooling and infrastructure as code. The distinction lies in where these capabilities are deployed and who oversees them.\n\n### Strategic Workload Placement\n\nThe trend toward repatriation is fundamentally about strategic workload placement. Organizations are realizing that not all workloads are equal, and the “lift and shift everything to public cloud” strategy often fails to yield the expected benefits.\n\nWorkloads with predictable resource requirements, sensitive data, or stable performance needs are increasingly being transitioned back to private cloud environments, where they can be managed and controlled more effectively. Meanwhile, workloads that benefit from elastic scaling, global distribution, or specialized cloud services continue to reside in public clouds.\n\nThis hybrid approach enables organizations to optimize for different priorities, keeping mission-critical applications in private clouds for security and control, while utilizing public clouds for innovation and experimentation. It’s about selecting the right tool for each task rather than forcing all workloads into a single model.\n\n### Cost Governance and Predictability\n\nIn private cloud environments, IT departments can allocate resources per workload and precisely determine the cost of delivering those resources. This predictability encompasses not only infrastructure costs but also operational expenses, compliance costs and the total cost of ownership.\n\nWhen a department’s application suddenly requires additional compute power in a private cloud, it prompts a conversation about capacity planning and budget allocation, but not an unexpected bill at the end of the month. This level of control enables organizations to more effectively align IT spending with business objectives and mitigate the “shadow IT” issue that often plagues public cloud deployments.\n\n### The Path Forward\n\nIn this era of cloud reset, DevOps teams are not abandoning the benefits of the cloud, but rather refining their approach. Our analysis at ReveCom shows the next phase in cloud computing for DevOps teams involves selecting the right environment for each workload while ensuring performance, interoperability and accountability are in alignment with DevOps.\n\nFor many organizations, this means developing sophisticated hybrid cloud strategies that leverage the best of both worlds. Private clouds offer the control, security and predictability required for core business applications, while public clouds provide the flexibility and innovation platform for new initiatives.\n\nAs DevOps teams continue to move to private and hybrid clouds, it’s a strategic shift in how they think about their infrastructure. It’s acknowledging that the cloud isn’t just a destination, but an operational approach that can be applied where it makes the most sense for business. As DevOps teams continue to refine their cloud strategies, the focus is shifting from “cloud-first” to “cloud-smart,” with private clouds increasingly playing a crucial role in delivering the promise of cloud computing while maintaining the governance and control that enterprises need.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Cloudshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Cloudshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Cloudshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Cloudshttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Cloudshttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Clouds%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Clouds%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Clouds%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Clouds%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fthe-cloud-reset-devops-brings-workloads-back-to-private-clouds%2F&amp;linkname=The%20Cloud%20Reset%3A%20DevOps%20Brings%20Workloads%20Back%20to%20Private%20Clouds%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« How Software Engineers and Students Use AI to Move Faster than Ever (without breaking things)](https://devops.com/how-software-engineers-and-students-use-ai-to-move-faster-than-ever-without-breaking-things/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
