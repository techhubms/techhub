Depending on who’s talking, AI is either saving the day or slowing workflow to a crawl. As always, the truth lies somewhere in between.\n\nLet’s start with numbers—because CEOs love numbers. A recent [GitLab–Harris Poll](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gitlab-c-suite-survey-ai-130000192.html?utm_) survey, spotlighted on DevOps.com, reveals that C-level executives believe their organizations are [saving about $28,249 per developer per year](https://devops.com/survey-attributes-massive-economic-gains-to-rise-of-ai-in-software-development/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) thanks to AI—citing a 48% boost in developer productivity and revenue growth of 44% from software innovation. Boards are buying in: 91% say software innovation is a core business priority, and 73% believe the future of development is roughly a 50/50 human–AI partnership.\n\nImpressive. But let’s pump the brakes.\n\nIn a rigorously controlled study by [METR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09089) earlier this year, 16 seasoned open-source devs worked on codebases they deeply knew. The result? Using AI tools like Cursor Pro and Claude Sonnet slowed them down by 19%, not sped them up—even though they believed they’d gotten 20% faster.\n\nSo, what’s going on?\n\n### **Anecdotes from the Trenches**\n\nI’ve asked around—friends in DevOps, SRE, platform engineering, QA. Some swear AI has become indispensable: code scaffolding, test generation, documentation, even automated monitoring rules—AI frees them to focus on higher‑order problems. Others say it’s a distraction: slow response times, hallucinations, buggy outputs. They reverted to using AI only for very specific tasks—and even then, cautiously.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n### **Why the Numbers Vary So Widely**\n\nA few takeaways on the inconsistencies:\n\n1. **Different Perspectives, Different Truths:** C‑levels see aggregate ROI. They hear, “We saved $28K per dev,” and think AI is working wonders. But for veteran developers wrestling with complex, familiar code, those tools may get in the way.\n2. **Productivity Is Hard to Measure:** It’s not just lines of code or build velocity. Consider code review quality, mean time to recovery (MTTR), mental workload, or innovation throughput. AI may boost documentation, reduce brain strain, or improve test coverage—benefits that don’t show up in raw speed metrics.\n3. **Use Case Matters:** METR’s study focused on incremental work in mature repositories—a tough environment for AI. Newer or less experienced devs might see different effects. For example, GitHub Copilot has shown up to 55% faster task completion in controlled JavaScript experiments, and broader Copilot use has led to higher acceptance rates for generated code and potential global GDP impact.\n4. **Bias and Perception:** People love saying AI helps—it’s fun, it feels good. But as METR pointed out, “developer satisfaction ≠ speed.” Emotional payoff can skew perception.\n5. **Reliability and Trust Issues:** Even as developers adopt AI, recent incidents—like Replit mistakenly deleting critical data or Google Gemini CLI destroying files—have rattled trust. According to a Stack Overflow survey, 84% use or plan to use AI coding tools, yet nearly **half distrust** the accuracy, 75% prefer human input, and two‑thirds have ethical or security concerns.\n\n### **So, Should You Believe the Hype?**\n\nYes—but with caveats.\n\n- For executives, AI clearly presents economic opportunity and strategic promise.\n- For developers, especially trafficking in complex, legacy systems, the current generation of AI tools may introduce friction.\n- The real power of AI may lie in assisting—not replacing—human developers, particularly when matched to tasks like testing, documentation, design reviews, onboarding, or scaffolding new modules.\n\nAt the end of the day, AI in the software lifecycle isn’t a silver bullet—and it’s not a catastrophe. It’s a powerful tool that, when wielded with context awareness and realistic expectations, can be transformative. But until AI better grasps nuance, legacy complexity, and real-world workflows, the hype will keep over-promising—and developers will need to keep testing, measuring, and adapting.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hypehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hypehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hypehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hypehttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hypehttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hype%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hype%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hype%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hype%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype%2F%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Drss%26utm_campaign%3Dai-do-or-dont-believe-the-hype&amp;linkname=AI%3A%20Do%20or%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20the%20Hype%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Why Continuous Integration Matters More Than Ever](https://devops.com/why-continuous-integration-matters-more-than-ever/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×"
