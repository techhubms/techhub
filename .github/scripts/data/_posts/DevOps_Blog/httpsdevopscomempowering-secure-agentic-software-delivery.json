Stay informed on the latest DevOps news\n\nEmpowering Secure, Agentic Software Delivery\n\nAt swampUP 2025 in Napa Valley, JFrog co-founder and CTO Yoav Landman joined Alan to reflect on the company’s latest announcements and the broader direction of software delivery in the AI era. Landman noted that this year’s event may have been JFrog’s most ambitious yet, with a wave of product releases designed to tie together themes of trust, automation, and AI-driven DevOps.\n\nOne highlight is the company’s push to unify governance through AppTrust, which provides end-to-end traceability and compliance across the software supply chain. The aim is to ensure that every artifact — whether human- or AI-generated — can be validated and trusted before moving through the pipeline.\n\nAnother centerpiece is JFrog Fly, billed as an “agentic repository” that enables AI agents to securely interact with APIs and development workflows via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). As AI coding tools become commonplace, Fly is intended to help DevOps teams manage the complexity of agent-driven development while maintaining control and visibility.\n\nLandman emphasized that these aren’t abstract roadmaps — they’re production-ready features shaped directly by customer feedback. The feedback loop from swampUP, he noted, often influences products within months rather than years, especially as AI accelerates iteration cycles.\n\nFor Landman, the common thread across these initiatives is addressing the realities of modern DevOps: accelerating release velocity while ensuring governance and security don’t lag behind. With software supply chains under constant pressure and AI poised to reshape workflows, he argued that platforms like JFrog must become the system of record for DevOps in order to keep pace.\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://securityboulevard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Techstrong-Gang-Youtube-PodcastV2-770.png)](https://youtu.be/Fojn5NFwaw8)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\n[![Techstrong Gang Youtube](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/770X330-DevOps-AppDev-Mar2025-2D.jpg)](https://info.futurumgroup.com/devops_appdev?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=in-article&utm_campaign=DevOps-Application-Report)\n\nThe conversation underscored the urgency: in a world where AI is changing how code is created and deployed, trust and automation aren’t optional — they’re foundational.\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Deliveryhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Deliveryhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Deliveryhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Deliveryhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Deliveryhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\nhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/x?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Delivery%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Delivery%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Delivery%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Delivery%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fdevops.com%2Fempowering-secure-agentic-software-delivery%2F&amp;linkname=Empowering%20Secure%2C%20Agentic%20Software%20Delivery%20-%20DevOps.comhttps://www.addtoany.com/share\n\n[« Building End-to-End Trust in the Software Supply Chain](https://devops.com/building-end-to-end-trust-in-the-software-supply-chain/)\n\n[![](https://devops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Copy-of-DO-Banners-1540x660-1.png)](https://webinars.devops.com/in-article-newsletter-popup)\n\n×",
