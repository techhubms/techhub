  "Description": "Nedim’s [recent post](https://medium.com/@nedimhozic/net-aspire-bridging-the-gap-between-application-and-infrastructure-07e94e8e9432) does a great job summarizing what Aspire is today. I want to talk a bit about where we’re headed — and more importantly, *why* we’re building it this way.\n\nAt its core, Aspire is a platform that gives developers an abstraction that makes sense to them, and gives platform engineers and DevOps teams a place to plug in.\n\nLet me explain what I mean.\n\n**The platform engineer abstracts over the cloud provider**\n\nIn my view of the world, platform engineers abstract over the cloud provider. They take the raw capabilities of something like Azure, AWS, or GCP — and curate a secure, cost-controlled, locked-down subset of that cloud for the rest of the organization. They enforce policy, establish best practices, and manage the boundaries between environments.\n\nBut to do that well, they need two things:\n\n1. A way to describe the policies, capabilities, and constraints of the environment they’re building.\n2. A developer experience that makes those constraints usable and understandable to the teams actually building apps.\n\nThe first part is (relatively) solved (tools exist, but they are low level and have gaps). There are plenty of infrastructure-as-code tools — Terraform, Bicep, Pulumi, etc. — that let platform teams define their world.\n\nThe second part is where things fall apart.\n\n**This is the gap Aspire is trying to fill**\n\nDevelopers shouldn’t have to know what flavor of PostgreSQL their org uses, what subnet it’s on, or which configuration knobs to toggle. They shouldn’t need to learn how to write Terraform to use Redis.\n\nBut they *do* need to describe their app: what it consists of, what it connects to, and what its dependencies are. Aspire gives them a way to do that in their language — projects, services, containers, endpoints, references.\n\nAt the same time, Aspire gives platform engineers an integration point. They can define what happens when someone calls AddRedis() or adds a project with WithReference() — what infrastructure that maps to, how it’s configured, and what policies apply.\n\nThis is the heart of Aspire: a bridge between the way developers think and the world platform engineers manage.\n\n**Aspire is not here to replace your infrastructure toolchain**\n\nWe’re not trying to be another Pulumi or Terraform. Those tools are great at describing infrastructure. Aspire is about describing *applications, their dependencies and* relationships — and then giving you enough hooks to connect that to whatever infra layer you want.\n\nAspire can feed into those tools. It can generate configuration, produce environment-specific manifests, and wire up resources with the right secrets and connection strings. But it always starts from the application developer’s point of view.\n\nThat’s the difference.\n\n**Where we’re going**\n\nRight now, Aspire is focused on improving the local development loop — modeling apps, spinning up dependencies, and simplifying service discovery and configuration.\n\nBut that’s just the beginning.\n\nIn the future, Aspire will help you:\n\n- Define environment-specific behavior (what “Redis” means in dev vs. test vs. prod)\n- Generate pipeline and deployment scaffolding from your app model\n- Support platform-defined “components” or “integrations” that wrap infrastructure, defaults, policies, and wiring\n- Enable full app modeling as code — not YAML\n\nUltimately, I want you to be able to describe your app once, and have that shape:\n\n- Your local dev setup\n- Your pipeline config\n- Your production deployment\n\nThis is the world we’re building toward.\n\n**Wrapping up**\n\nAspire is a bet on better abstractions. It’s not just about spinning up containers faster — it’s about helping developers express what they’re building in a way that maps to how platform engineers run it.\n\nWe’re trying to shrink the gap between intent and execution. Between “I want to add Redis” and “here’s the production-grade, policy-compliant, secure, observable Redis that works in all environments.”\n\nIt’s early, but the foundation is there — and I’m excited for where it’s going.\n\n![](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6eb421a92ab8)",
