  "Description": "At the heart of Aspire is a resource model. It defines the shape of your application — its services, dependencies, configuration, and how everything connects. But this model doesn’t just describe intent; it runs in two distinct modes:\n\nIn **runtime mode**, Aspire acts as a local orchestrator. It executes your application model directly, standing up resources like processes, containers, and local emulations of cloud services. This is the developer inner loop: fast, iterative, and predictable. Resources behave like runtime entities with well-defined lifecycles. This lets developers model their app the same way whether they’re running everything locally or deploying to the cloud.\n\nIn **publish mode**, Aspire compiles the application model into artifacts you can hand off to a deployment pipeline. These include Kubernetes manifests, Terraform configs, Bicep/ARM templates, Docker Compose files, or CDK-based constructs.\n\nIn Aspire, the action is called **publishing**, and the units that perform this work are called **publishers**. But under the hood, the architecture closely mirrors a traditional compiler.\n\n### Lowering the Model\n\nIn a traditional compiler, you take a high-level programming language and lower it step by step:\n\n- First into an **intermediate representation** (IR), which abstracts away language-specific features.\n- Then into **machine code**, tailored to a specific CPU architecture.\n\nAspire does the same thing, but for applications:\n\n- The **application model** is the high-level language.\n- Aspire lowers this into **intermediate constructs**, which may or may not be target-specific (for example, CDK-style object graphs).\n- Finally, a **publisher** emits the target runtime representation: the YAML, HCL, or JSON files your platform actually runs.\n\nThis layered approach lets Aspire do powerful things:\n\n- Validate and enrich models during transformation\n- Support multiple deployment targets\n- Let users hook into each phase to customize behavior\n- Keep the high-level model clean, expressive, and portable\n\nAnd importantly, **the translation process itself is extensible**. You can define your own transformations, enrichments, and output formats, allowing Aspire to adapt to your unique infrastructure and deployment environments.\n\n### A Compiler for Application Topology\n\nMost tools out there operate at one layer: either they run your app, or they deploy it. Aspire spans both.\n\nWe don’t just execute the app — we *compile* it. This gives us structure, separation of concerns, and the ability to build reusable publishing pipelines.\n\nWant to inject annotations into every resource before deployment? Write a transform. Want to target a new environment like Nomad or Azure Container Apps? Write a publisher.\n\nJust like compilers enable new languages to target new chips, Aspire enables new models to target new infrastructure.\n\nPublish mode is still evolving, but this compiler-like architecture gives us a foundation to grow from. In the future, Aspire will:\n\n- Enable fully declarative deployment workflows\n- Support multiple publish targets out of the box\n- Let teams build custom publishers and transforms for their internal platforms\n- Bridge the gap between developer intent and production infrastructure\n\nWe’re building a compiler for application topology — one that treats your architecture as a first-class artifact.\n\nMost tools give you a way to run your app. Aspire gives you a way to *describe* it — and then compile that description into something real.\n\nThis is how we bridge the gap between local dev and production, between intent and implementation.\n\nThis is the Aspire compiler.\n\n![](https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f8ccdf4bca0c)",
