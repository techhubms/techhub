I look it up every time, and waste more than a few minutes in trying to pin down the problem. So I'm writing it down!\n\nIssue is this:\n\n- Trying to renew my Administration Server Certificate\n- It's a self-signed certificate\n- Prompts for Hostname (auto-fills)\n- Prompts for **Distinguished Name**\n\nFor the Distinguished name which is typically provided as a hostname, any reasonable person would put in the... well, the hostname:\n\n![Filezilla Admin Self Signed Admin Certificate](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2025/FileZilla-Server-Self-Generated-Certs-and-Distinguished-Name-failures/FileZillaAdminSelfSignedAdminCertificate.png)\n\nbut unfortunately this is what you get in response:\n\n![Filezilla Admin Self Signed Admin Certificate FAIL](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2025/FileZilla-Server-Self-Generated-Certs-and-Distinguished-Name-failures/FileZillaAdminSelfSignedAdminCertificate-FAIL.png)\n\nYeah, not really helpful, that! üí©\n\n[!\\[\\](/images/sponsors/banner-example.png?v=1.2)](https://markdownmonster.west-wind.com?ut=weblog)\n\n## Distinguish This!\n\nThe problem is that Filezilla actually **expects a full Common Name entry** so what's required is something like this (at minimum):\n\n![Dialog With CN](https://weblog.west-wind.com/images/2025/FileZilla-Server-Self-Generated-Certs-and-Distinguished-Name-failures/DialogWithCN.png)\n\nNow it works.\n\nUnintuitively, you have to provide a proper Common Name (CN) formatted string. It doesn't help that the dialog calls this the *Distinguished Name*, which is the domain part of the Common Name, which normally with other certificate requests refers to the DNS domain name.\n\nWith Filezilla you need a CN formatted string:\n\n**Minimal** (works)\n\n```none CN=ftp.example.com\n\n```\n\n**Full**\n\n```none CN=ftp.example.com, O=Example Corp, C=US\n\n```\n\n*-- **O** for organization, **C** for country.*\n\nAnd that's all it takes. I didn't put those in here and it worked fine without - only the CN entry is required especially for the local admin certificate.\n\n## Summary\n\nFilezilla isn't known for nice interfaces and the Admin interfaces are clearly very Unix focused and assume a lot of things. This is one of those cases. It's not the first time I've stumbled on this, which is why I'm here writing this trivial bit of information down in the hopes it will help burn it into my brain so I remember next time. üòÅ\n\n[!\\[\\](/images/Sponsors/BearsBeer-Display.jpg)](https://goldenbeartshirts.com)\n\n### Other Posts you might also like\n\n- [Using SQL Server on Windows ARM](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Oct/24/Using-Sql-Server-on-Windows-ARM)\n- [Fighting through Setting up Microsoft Trusted Signing](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2025/Jul/20/Fighting-through-Setting-up-Microsoft-Trusted-Signing)\n- [Web Browser Control & Specifying the IE Version](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2011/May/21/Web-Browser-Control-Specifying-the-IE-Version)\n- [Programmatic Html to PDF Generation using the WebView2 Control with .NET](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2024/Mar/26/Html-to-PDF-Generation-using-the-WebView2-Control)\n\nShare on:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2025/Jun/06/Distinguished-Name-on-FileZilla-Server-SelfGenerated-Certs&amp;text=Distinguished%20Name%20on%20FileZilla%20Server%20Self-Generated%20Certs&amp;via=RickStrahl\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2025/Jun/06/Distinguished-Name-on-FileZilla-Server-SelfGenerated-Certs&amp;t=Distinguished%20Name%20on%20FileZilla%20Server%20Self-Generated%20Certs http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2025/Jun/06/Distinguished-Name-on-FileZilla-Server-SelfGenerated-Certs&amp;title=Distinguished%20Name%20on%20FileZilla%20Server%20Self-Generated%20Certs\n\n![Make Donation](/images/donation.png \"Find this content useful?
