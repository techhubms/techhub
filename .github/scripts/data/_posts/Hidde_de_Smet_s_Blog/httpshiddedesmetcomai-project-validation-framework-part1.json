This is Part 1 of a 3-part series.\n\n# Is AI the right solution? A guide to validating AI projects\n\nBefore diving into complex AI development, it’s crucial to determine if AI is genuinely the most effective and appropriate solution for the problem at hand. This guide outlines key considerations and a decision tree framework to help you make an informed decision.\n\n## The AI project ROI decision tree framework\n\nA decision tree for evaluating AI project ROI, especially for non-technical stakeholders, should be simple, clear, and focus on business outcomes. Here’s a potential starting structure:\n\n### Level 1: Strategic alignment\n\n- **Question 1:**Does the proposed AI project directly align with our company’s strategic objectives? (e.g., related to core operations, innovation goals, market positioning, customer satisfaction)\n- **Yes:** Proceed to evaluate key project pillars.\n- **No:** Re-evaluate or reject. (Clearly state why it’s not aligned).\n\n### Evaluating key project pillars (Objective, Audience, Training, Operations)\n\nTo assess the feasibility and potential of an AI project, consider the following four pillars. These should be used alongside broader feasibility criteria (data readiness, skills availability, and technology stack readiness) for a comprehensive evaluation.\n\n1. **Objective**: Clearly define the problem the AI project aims to solve. Ensure it aligns with the strategic goals of the company and addresses a specific, measurable pain point or opportunity. What does success look like?\n2. **Audience/Impact scope**: Estimate the number of paying customers, internal users, or stakeholders who will benefit from the system. Quantify the potential positive impact (e.g., on customer satisfaction, employee productivity, operational efficiency, revenue generation).\n3. **Training & data**: Evaluate the time, cost, and resources required to acquire/prepare data and train the AI model. Consider the availability, volume, and quality of (labeled) data, and the complexity of the training process. What are the data acquisition and preparation efforts?\n4. **Operational cost & maintenance**: Assess the average daily, monthly, or annual cost of running the AI system in production. Include infrastructure, maintenance, monitoring, model retraining, and ongoing support costs.\n\n### Level 2: Potential business impact\n\n- **Question 2:**What is the primary expected business benefit?\n- **A) Cost reduction:** (e.g., optimizing processes, reducing waste, automating manual tasks, lowering operational expenditures) -&gt; Proceed to impact quantification (A)\n- **B) Revenue increase:** (e.g., personalized experiences, new product/service offerings, market expansion, improved customer acquisition/retention) -&gt; Proceed to impact quantification (B)\n- **C) Risk mitigation:** (e.g., predicting supply chain disruptions, ensuring quality control, fraud detection, improving compliance) -&gt; Proceed to impact quantification (C)\n- **D) Efficiency improvement:** (e.g., automating repetitive tasks, speeding up processes, improving resource utilization) -&gt; Proceed to impact quantification (D)\n- **Other (specify):** (e.g., improved decision making, enhanced innovation capabilities) -&gt; Proceed to impact quantification (Other)\n\n### Level 3: Impact quantification\n\n- **Question 3 (Example for Cost Reduction):**Can we estimate the potential cost savings with reasonable accuracy?\n- **Yes:** What are the estimated annual savings? (e.g., &lt;$X, $X-$Y, &gt;$Y). How confident are we in this estimate? -&gt; Proceed to feasibility & effort.\n- **No:** Further analysis needed before proceeding. Hold. The inability to quantify impact is a significant risk.\n\n*(Similar quantification questions, focusing on measurable outcomes and confidence levels, would follow for revenue increase, risk mitigation, efficiency improvements, etc.)*\n\n### Level 4: Feasibility & effort\n\nThis level integrates the “Evaluate key project pillars” with a more direct assessment of implementation challenges.\n\n- **Question 4:**What is the estimated effort/cost to implement this AI project (including development, infrastructure, training, and initial rollout)?\n- **Low:** (e.g., &lt;3 months, &lt;$Budget\\_Low)\n- **Medium:** (e.g., 3-9 months, $Budget\\_Low-$Budget\\_Medium)\n- **High:** (e.g., &gt;9 months, &gt;$Budget\\_Medium)\n- **Question 5:**Based on the “Pillars” evaluation, do we have the necessary data (quality, quantity, accessibility), skills (internal team, external support), and technology (infrastructure, tools)?\n- **Yes, mostly:** Proceed.\n- **Partially, gaps exist:** Identify gaps and formulate a clear plan to address them. This might involve investment in data acquisition/cleansing, upskilling/hiring, or technology adoption. Factor this into the overall effort and cost.\n- **No, significant gaps:** High risk. Re-evaluate the project’s viability or make foundational investments in prerequisites before proceeding with the AI project itself.\n\n### Level 5: ROI Assessment & Go/No-Go decision\n\n- **Based on quantified impact vs. estimated effort/cost and risk assessment:**\n- **High impact / Low effort:** Prioritize (Quick Win). These projects offer the best immediate returns with manageable risk.\n- **High impact / Medium-High effort:** Strategic bet (plan carefully). These require significant investment and careful planning but promise substantial long-term value. Risk mitigation strategies are crucial.\n- **Low impact / Low effort:** Consider if resources allow (opportunistic). These can be pursued if they align with strategic goals and don’t detract from higher-priority initiatives. Ensure they are genuinely low effort.\n- **Low impact / High effort:** Avoid or De-prioritize. These projects are unlikely to deliver sufficient value for the investment and effort required.\n\n### Visualizing the decision process: AI project ROI decision tree\n\n```mermaid graph TD A[Start: New AI project proposal] --> B{L1: Strategic alignment?}; B -- Yes --> FP[Evaluate: Objective, Audience, Training, Operations]; B -- No --> Z1[Reject/Re-evaluate: not aligned];\n\nFP --> C{L2: Primary business benefit?};\n\nC --> D1[Cost reduction]; C --> D2[Revenue increase]; C --> D3[Risk mitigation]; C --> D4[Efficiency improvement]; C --> D5[Other];\n\nD1 --> E1{L3: Est.
