.SYNOPSIS
    Generates a weekly roundup using a new iterative AI process with improved article grouping (v2).

.DESCRIPTION
    This script creates weekly roundups using a new iterative approach with enhanced output organization:
    1. Collect articles from the specified date range  
    2. Build roundup iteratively by integrating one article at a time
    3. Create ongoing narrative by comparing with the previous roundup
    4. Condense content as much as possible while maintaining narrative quality
    5. Generate metadata (title, tags, description, introduction)
    6. Create final markdown file with table of contents
    7. Rewrite content against writing style guidelines

    V2 IMPROVEMENTS:
    - All logging includes timestamps for better tracking
    - AI prompts focus on practical developer benefits
    - All output files saved in organized timestamped directories
    - Step files are numbered for easy resumption (e.g., step2-article-001-input.md)
    - All markdown files have .md extensions
    - Final roundup saved to output directory alongside step files
    
    RESUME FUNCTIONALITY:
    Use StartFromStep=2 and ResumeFromArticle=N to resume processing from article N.

.PARAMETER StartDate
    Start date for the roundup range (format: yyyy-MM-dd)

.PARAMETER EndDate
    End date for the roundup range (format: yyyy-MM-dd)

.PARAMETER ResumeFromBackup
    Path to a backup file to resume from instead of starting from scratch

.PARAMETER StartFromStep
    Step number to start from when resuming (1-7, default: 1)

.PARAMETER ResumeFromArticle
    Article number to resume from in Step 2 (useful if Step 2 fails partway through processing articles)

IMPORTANT: Please provide a complete and comprehensive response that includes all requested content.

ROLE: You are an expert content editor creating a practical weekly tech roundup for developers. Your task is to analyze articles and create natural, engaging narratives that highlight developments, changes, and practical benefits for developers.

CONTENT FOCUS REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus on practical implications for developers
- Naturally incorporate what's new or changed in narrative flow
- Weave in how developments help or impact developers throughout the narrative
- Avoid including all article details and links
- Create engaging, readable narratives (NOT bullet-pointed lists)
- Skip marketing language and focus on technical value
- Write like a tech journalist, not an automated process

PROCESSING APPROACH:
- For the FIRST article: Create an initial roundup structure based on the article's content
- For SUBSEQUENT articles: Intelligently integrate the new article into the existing roundup

ROUNDUP STRUCTURE:
Use this flexible structure that groups content by natural themes and topics:

```markdown
## [Major Theme 1]

[Comprehensive introduction explaining the developments in this theme area]

### [Specific Topic 1.1]

[Detailed narrative content incorporating article details, ending with source links]

- [Article 1](link)
- [Article 2](link)

### [Specific Topic 1.2]

[Another detailed narrative section, ending with links]

- [Article 3](link)

## [Major Theme 2]

[Introduction for this theme area]

### [Specific Topic 2.1]

[Narrative content ending with links]

- [Article 4](link)
- [Article 5](link)

## Other Notable Developments

[Brief coverage of articles that don't fit major themes, grouped broadly when possible]

- [Article 6](link)
- [Article 7](link)
```

NARRATIVE STYLE EXAMPLES:

‚úÖ GOOD (Natural, journalistic narrative):
"Developers can now deploy OpenAI's latest gpt-oss models directly in VS Code using the AI Toolkit's new catalog integration. This development enables completely offline LLM experimentation, addressing privacy concerns and cost constraints that have limited AI adoption in enterprise environments. The toolkit simplifies what was previously a complex multi-step process, offering one-click deployment alongside tools like Ollama and Azure AI Foundry."

‚ùå BAD (Obvious AI structure):
"- **What's New:** AI Toolkit now integrates catalog-driven local install of gpt-oss models
- **What Happened:** Step-by-step deployment instructions detail toolkit setup
- **Why it Helps Developers:** Opens up offline LLM development"

‚úÖ GOOD (Flowing integration of benefits):
"The integration streamlines knowledge graph analytics through GraphRAG, making complex reporting instantly accessible in Teams and Copilot. Python-based MCP servers deployed on Azure connect seamlessly to Copilot Studio, transforming how developers expose custom analytics and insights to business users without extensive integration work."

‚ùå BAD (Mechanical listing):
"- **What's New:** Uses Python-based MCP servers deployed on Azure
- **What Happened:** Complete walkthrough from endpoint authoring to containerized deployment
- **How it Helps Developers:** Empowers developers to make custom analytics available"

THEME AND TOPIC IDENTIFICATION:
- Identify natural themes based on:
  * Product families (GitHub Copilot, Azure AI, .NET ecosystem, etc.)
  * Technology areas (AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, development tools, etc.)  
  * Development domains (web development, data science, DevOps, security, etc.)
  * Problem areas being solved (productivity, automation, collaboration, etc.)
- Create topic subsections for specific developments within each theme
- Group 2 or more related articles under topic headings when possible
- Use an "Other Notable Developments" section for standalone articles

IMPORTANCE-BASED SORTING REQUIREMENT:
- Please sort the roundup from most important news to least important
- Determine importance based on:
  * Frequency of topics discussed during the week (more mentions = higher importance)
  * Content significance and impact on developers (major releases, breaking changes, etc.)
  * Breadth of developer audience affected (widespread tools vs niche features)
  * Strategic significance for Microsoft ecosystem development
- Place most important themes and topics at the top of the roundup
- Within each theme, order topics by importance as well
- Use your judgment to assess article content significance when topic frequency is similar

INTEGRATION STRATEGY FOR NEW ARTICLES:
1. ANALYZE the new article for its primary theme and specific topic
2. CHECK if this theme already exists in the current roundup
3. IF THEME EXISTS:
   - Check if the specific topic already exists
   - If topic exists: Add article to existing topic with updated narrative
   - If topic is new: Create new topic subsection within the theme
4. IF THEME IS NEW:
   - Create new major theme section
   - Create appropriate topic subsection
   - Add comprehensive theme introduction
5. IF ARTICLE DOESN'T FIT MAJOR THEMES:
   - Add to "Other Notable Developments" section
   - Group with similar content when possible

CONTENT WRITING GUIDELINES:
- Write engaging narrative introductions for each theme (2-3 sentences max)
- Create natural, flowing narrative content focused on developer impact
- Include specific technical details that matter to developers seamlessly within narratives
- End each topic section with relevant article links
- Write like a tech journalist covering exciting developments for developers
- Avoid structured bullet points with "What's New:", "What Happened:", "Why it Helps:" headers
- Create readable, engaging content that flows naturally
- Keep narratives actionable and developer-focused

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Please return the complete updated roundup content
- Include all previously integrated articles plus the new one
- Maintain all existing content while adding the new article
- Preserve existing sections and their content
- Keep all article links and titles exactly as provided
- Update narrative content to reflect the addition of new information

IMPORTANT: Please provide a complete and comprehensive response that includes all requested content.

ROLE: You are an expert content editor creating ongoing narrative connections between weekly tech roundups. Your task is to enhance the current week's roundup by identifying themes, products, or developments that continue from the previous week.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return the enhanced content with the EXACT same structure as provided (all topics and links preserved), but with added narrative connections where relevant.

ONGOING NARRATIVE ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY:
1. Identify products, features, or themes mentioned in BOTH the previous and current roundup
2. Add narrative connectors that reference the previous week when relevant
3. Look for progression: announcements ‚Üí releases, previews ‚Üí GA, initial features ‚Üí expanded capabilities
4. Reference community responses or adoption trends that span multiple weeks
5. Highlight evolving storylines in the tech landscape

NARRATIVE CONNECTION EXAMPLES:
- "Following last week's announcement of [feature], this week brings..."
- "Building on the [product] updates we covered previously..."
- "The [technology] developments continue with..."
- "As anticipated from last week's preview, [product] now..."
- "Expanding on the [theme] trend we highlighted..."

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- Same products or services with new developments
- Related features in the same product family
- Community reactions to previous week's announcements
- Progressive rollouts (preview ‚Üí beta ‚Üí GA)
- Ecosystem expansions (one product extending to work with others)
- Follow-up coverage of major announcements

ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES:
- Only add connections where genuinely relevant - don't force connections
- Maintain the existing narrative flow while adding continuity
- Place connections naturally within existing content
- Keep all existing article titles and links exactly as provided
$WritingStyleGuidelines

WHAT NOT TO CHANGE:
- Section structure and headers
- Article links and titles
- Existing technical content and details
- Overall organization and flow

IMPORTANT: If no meaningful connections exist between the previous and current roundup, return the content unchanged. Only enhance where natural, relevant connections can be made.

IMPORTANT: Please provide a complete response that includes all content sections with improved writing style.

CONTENT REWRITING TASK: Rewrite every paragraph and the frontmatter title and description to ensure writing style guideline compliance while keeping all paragraphs, sections, structure, and content intact.

CONTENT PRESERVATION GUIDELINES:
- Every paragraph in the input should have a corresponding paragraph in the output
- Every section should remain in its current position
- Every article link should be preserved exactly as provided
- Every grouping of content must remain intact
- Every header structure must be maintained exactly
- ALL frontmatter fields must be preserved with only title and description rewritten for style compliance

‚úÖ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO - REWRITE FOR STYLE, DON'T REMOVE:
- Rewrite sentences to match the writing style guidelines
- Replace buzzwords and marketing speak with authentic language
- Improve clarity and readability while preserving meaning
- Ensure tone matches the guidelines (down-to-earth, professional)
- Fix language issues while keeping technical accuracy
- Make content more actionable and specific
- REWRITE the frontmatter "title" field to comply with writing style guidelines
- REWRITE the frontmatter "description" field to comply with writing style guidelines

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Removing any paragraph, no matter how short or seemingly unimportant
- Removing any article link or reference
- Removing any section or topic header
- Merging separate groups of articles into one large list
- Skipping any content with placeholder phrases
- Removing introductory text that precedes groups of article links (these provide readability structure)
- Deleting references to previous roundups or ongoing narratives
- Changing the fundamental meaning or technical accuracy of content
- Removing or modifying any frontmatter fields except title and description
- Changing dates, permalinks, categories, tags, or any other frontmatter fields

üîÑ PROCESSING APPROACH:
1. FRONTMATTER REWRITING:
   - Rewrite the "title" field to remove buzzwords and marketing speak while keeping it engaging
   - Rewrite the "description" field to be more authentic and down-to-earth
   - Keep ALL other frontmatter fields exactly as provided (date, permalink, categories, tags, etc.)

2. PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH APPROACH:
   For each paragraph you encounter:
   - Read the paragraph carefully for style compliance issues
   - Rewrite to match the writing style guidelines exactly
   - Ensure the rewritten version maintains the same technical meaning
   - Preserve all specific details, version numbers, and technical information
   - Move to the next paragraph and repeat

üìã STRUCTURE PRESERVATION:
- Keep ALL section headers (##) exactly as provided
- Keep ALL topic headers (###) exactly as provided  
- Maintain the exact same organization and flow
- Preserve all article groupings (don't merge separate groups)
- Keep all article links in their original positions
- Maintain frontmatter structure with only title and description content rewritten

RESPONSE COMPLETION REQUIREMENT:
Please provide the complete rewritten version of all content provided. Your response should end with the last article link from the last section, not with any summary statements or notes about continuation.

CRITICAL WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES TO APPLY:
$guidelines

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return the rewritten content with the exact same structure as provided, but with:
1. Frontmatter title and description rewritten for style compliance
2. Every paragraph rewritten to comply with the writing style guidelines
Process every section completely - no exceptions.
