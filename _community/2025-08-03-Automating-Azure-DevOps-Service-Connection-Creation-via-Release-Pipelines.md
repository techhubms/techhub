Odd-Good-6514 and several contributors examine approaches for automating Azure DevOps service connection setup across environments, detailing authentication considerations and alternatives to manual setup.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Automating Azure DevOps Service Connection Creation via Release Pipelines

Original author: Odd-Good-6514

## Scenario

The author maintains a PowerShell script that automates the creation of Azure DevOps service connections from a set of JSON files. Typically, this process involves logging in via the Azure CLI (`az login`) and manually running the scripts.

## Objective

- Automate running these scripts using a release pipeline that processes all service connection definitions across multiple environments.
- Enable automated, repeatable provisioning of service connections from Azure DevOps to Azure resources.

## Key Challenge: Authentication in Pipelines

The main technical concern raised is *how to authenticate* within the release pipeline to create the service connections:

- Options mentioned include using a Personal Access Token (PAT), an existing service connection, or alternative mechanisms such as OIDC.
- Contributors caution that service connections, once created, still require manual specification in pipeline definitions, as they cannot be dynamically assigned via variables.
- Pipeline definitions may be updated via Azure DevOps REST APIs, but this adds complexity and might reduce benefits of automation.

## Suggested Best Practices

- **Use an existing service connection** in the pipeline for authenticationâ€”don't create credentials on the fly.
- **Service Principals in Entra (Azure AD):** Create a service principal with precise, least-privilege permissions required for connection setup.
- **OIDC-based Authentication:** Prefer OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication in pipelines to avoid manual credential management and password rotation.

## Additional Perspectives

- A contributor suggests reconsidering Azure DevOps altogether if your codebase resides in GitHub, implying GitHub Actions may offer a better integration story with modern authentication (OIDC by default).

## Takeaways

- Automating service connection creation is possible, but authentication (and permissions management) must be handled carefully.
- OIDC is recommended for modern pipeline authentication scenarios.
- Full automation of pipeline assignment to new service connections still has manual gaps or requires custom API logic.
