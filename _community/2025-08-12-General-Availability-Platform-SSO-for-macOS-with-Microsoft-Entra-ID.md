# General Availability: Platform SSO for macOS with Microsoft Entra ID

**Authors:** Veena Soman (Senior Software Engineer, Microsoft), Justin Ploegert (Principal Product Manager, Microsoft)

## Overview

Platform Single Sign-On (SSO) is now generally available for macOS with full support from Microsoft Entra ID. This feature, built on the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in, delivers integrated and secure single sign-on experiences across Apple devices in enterprise environments.

## What is Platform SSO?

Platform SSO leverages macOS integration and the Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in to allow users to authenticate to their Macs using Microsoft Entra ID. Once authenticated, users experience seamless, passwordless sign-in across applications and browsers, reducing authentication fatigue and enhancing organizational security.

**Key Features:**

- Passwordless sign-in via UserSecureEnclaveKey or Smart Card methods
- Use of device-bound passkeys through Secure Enclave-backed credentials
- Synchronized local accounts using Microsoft Entra ID passwords
- Seamless SSO across native macOS apps and browsers including Edge, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome
- Streamlined device registration and Just-in-Time (JIT) compliance onboarding

## Security and Operational Benefits

- Designed for zero trust security models and hybrid work scenarios
- Strong biometric enforcement (leverage Secure Enclave for phishing resistant authentication)
- Enhanced telemetry for diagnostics and visibility
- Granular authentication strength controls and policies
- Rich authentication logging for auditing and compliance
- Direct integration with Microsoft Graph APIs for programmatic management
- Cloud Kerberos support allowing macOS devices to access Azure file shares natively

## Early Adopter Feedback

Since public preview in May 2024, Platform SSO has seen adoption in education, healthcare, finance, and tech industries. Organizations report:

- Simplified user onboarding
- Reduced helpdesk calls for credential issues
- Strengthened Zero Trust postures

## Deployment Guide

To enable Platform SSO in your organization:

1. Ensure macOS devices are on version 13+ (14+ recommended) and enrolled in MDM such as Intune.
2. Deploy the Microsoft Intune Company Portal app (v5.2504.0 or later).
3. Configure Platform SSO policies in Intune or your preferred MDM.

## Whatâ€™s New Since Public Preview

Platform SSO's GA introduces:

- Hardware biometric enforcement (Secure Enclave)
- Enhanced IT admin diagnostics and sign-in log detail
- More granular authentication policy control
- Programmatic configuration via new Microsoft Graph APIs
- Cloud Kerberos support

## Looking Forward

Upcoming features include JIT compliance remediation and a redesigned My Security Info interface. Future Company Portal versions will support newer macOS enhancements, including macOS Tahoe 26, for SSO.
