# General Availability of Azure Backup Vaulted Support for Azure Files Premium (SSD) Shares

**Author:** Subhash_athreya

## Overview

Microsoft announces that Azure Backup now provides vaulted backup support for Azure Files Premium (SSD) shares, a critical advancement for organizations with mission-critical workloads on Azure Files. This feature allows IT administrators and developers to safeguard data using immutable and offsite backups, providing resilience against ransomware, accidental deletions, and regional outages.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Enterprise-Grade Data Protection**: Azure Backup now secures Premium (SSD) file shares at the same level as standard (HDD), supporting production scale workloads.
- **Immutable and Offsite Backups**: Defends against ransomware, accidental deletion, and region-wide disruptions with secure, untouchable copies held in geo-redundant storage.
- **Long-Term Retention and Granular Restores**: Retain data for compliance/regulatory needs and recover exactly what is needed at point-in-time.
- **Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)**: Enables cross-region restore, allowing business continuity even if the primary Azure region is unavailable.
- **Compliance and Security**: Supports scenarios requiring strict data durability, supporting financial, healthcare, and other regulated industries.

**Customer Perspective:**
> Implementing Azure Backup for our premium file shares has significantly enhanced our data protection strategy... The seamless integration and scalability makes it essential for our cloud infrastructure.  
> â€”Swisscom

## How It Works

1. **Cross-Region Recovery**: Restore data to a different Azure region as part of disaster recovery planning using Recovery Services vault with GRS.
2. **3-2-1 Backup Rule Compliance**: Ensures three copies of data across two types of storage, with one offsite (remote region). Aligns with industry best practices for backup and recovery.
3. **Security and Ransomware Protection**: Recovery Services vault maintains an untouched copy isolated from production, allowing organizations to restore from the last safe backup and resume operations after incidents.

## Use Case Scenarios

- **Profile Data in VDI Environments**:  
  Protect persistent FSLogix profiles for Azure Virtual Desktop, Citrix, or VMware Horizon, ensuring critical user data is resilient to attack or error.

- **Application Storage**:  
  Safeguard file shares supporting Windows-based enterprise applications (SQL Server, ERP systems, custom line-of-business apps).

- **Cloud-Native Workloads**:  
  Enable backup and disaster recovery for legacy NAS-to-cloud migrations, especially for SMB workloads on AKS or similar.

- **Hybrid Deployments with Azure File Sync**:  
  Extend resilient protection to hybrid environments, covering both on-premises and cloud-resident data.

## Getting Started

1. [Create a Recovery Services vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-create-recovery-services-vault?source=recommendations): The vault stores and manages your backups.
2. [Create a backup policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/manage-afs-backup#create-a-new-policy): Define backup frequency and retention according to business requirements.
3. [Select storage account and file shares](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-files?tabs=recovery-services-vault): Back up all or select file shares as needed for critical data.

**Tip:** Selecting the vault tier in policy settings enhances the security posture, provides managed offsite backup, and supports business continuity.
