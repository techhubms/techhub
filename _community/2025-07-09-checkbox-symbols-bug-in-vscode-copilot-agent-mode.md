ZomboBrain shares their recent experience using GitHub Copilot Pro within Visual Studio Code to improve their PowerShell scripting abilities. <!--excerpt_end--> One issue that has arisen during this process is the unexpected appearance of checkbox-like symbols in the code whenever a new task starts and ends, despite no actual checkboxes being intended in the script. The author points out this behavior as confusing and questions whether it is a known bug or some misconfiguration on their part.

To illustrate the problem, a screenshot is provided ([Imgur link](https://i.imgur.com/XMriK6h.png)), showing what these checkboxes look like in the code editor. Following further research, the author discovers a related, unaddressed bug report from May on the [GitHub repository for vs-code-copilot](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues/10537), suggesting that other users have encountered the same issue but a solution has yet to be implemented.

Overall, the article serves as both a bug report and a request for advice from the community, inviting further discussion and possible solutions for users facing similar challenges with GitHub Copilot Pro in Visual Studio Code.
