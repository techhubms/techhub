description: "The author observes that GitHub Copilot's agent inconsistently remembers code execution context within a session. Initially, it used `docker-compose`, but after code updates, it reverted to plain `python`. The article suggests better context retention for improved usability, referencing how Claude maintains such context."

Own-Dark14 highlights a limitation in GitHub Copilot's session memory, where the agent fails to retain context consistently during code execution.<!--excerpt_end-->

### Summary

Own-Dark14 discusses a user experience issue encountered with GitHub Copilot's agent during code execution within a single session. Initially, when prompted, the agent correctly executed code using `docker-compose`. Upon updating the code and requesting another run, the agent unexpectedly switched to running it with plain `python`, seemingly forgetting the previously used method.

### Observations

- **Inconsistency Noted**: The agent failed to remember its earlier context (execution via `docker-compose`) and changed behavior mid-session.
- **Expected Behavior**: Ideally, the agent should recall the context of execution style previously used in the session for consistency.
- **Comparison**: The author references Claude, noting its stronger session memory. Claude informs users not to re-upload files as it remembers within a session, benefiting user consistency.
- **User Recommendation**: The post advocates for improved contextual consistency in GitHub Copilot, suggesting that session memory enhancement would make for a more user-friendly experience.

### Conclusion

Retaining execution context, such as the method used to run code, is valuable for maintaining a seamless and predictable workflow in tools like GitHub Copilot.
