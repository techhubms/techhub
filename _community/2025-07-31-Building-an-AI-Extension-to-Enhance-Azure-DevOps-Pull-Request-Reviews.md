# Building an AI Extension to Enhance Azure DevOps Pull Request Reviews

**Author: TechieRedditer**

After struggling with long PR review cycles, I decided to build an AI-powered assistant that plugs directly into Azure DevOps to ease the pain of code review, work item tracking, and developer workflow.

---

## Features

- **AI-powered PR Reviews**: Delivers inline, GitHub-style review comments and code suggestions directly within your PRs.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Use phrases like "What bugs are assigned to me?" to quickly retrieve work items, saving time over manual dashboard navigation.
- **Automatic Work Item Creation**: Automatically generates new work items from review findings, tying actionable issues back to code discussions.
- **Bring Your Own LLM**: The extension works with your own OpenAI or Azure AI API key (BYOLLM approach), ensuring privacy and flexibility.

---

## Real-world Results

- **Review time lowered by approximately 60%**
- **Consistently identifies security issues missed by manual reviews**
- **Work item queries complete in seconds, reducing friction and boosting productivity**

---

## Availability

- **Free on the Visual Studio Marketplace**: [Download the extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aidevx.aidevex-extension)
- **See the demo/info**: [aidevex.com](https://aidevex.com/)

---

## Integration Scenarios and Limitations

- **Azure DevOps + Jira**: Currently supports only native Azure DevOps work item integration. Jira support is not available yet, but granular feature controls (enabling/disabling chat, PR review, or work item automation) are in the roadmap.
- **Complex Codebases**: For large monorepos (e.g., 500k+ lines, embedded/Eclipse projects, HAL target architectures), the extension reviews PRs in isolation due to language model context window limits. It won't perform deep, cross-project architectural analysis or recommend complex code reorganizations but will surface basic issues, security risks, and code smells.

---

## Manual Evaluation

You can manually test the extension on representative PRs alongside your current workflows. The extension operates read-only and provides a dedicated UI, ensuring a risk-free, side-by-side comparison with your regular review process.

---

## Key Takeaways

- AI-powered reviews can significantly accelerate PR turnaround while maintaining code quality.
- Integration leverages modern language models (OpenAI/Azure AI) without storing your code externally.
- Feature flexibility and real-world constraints are openly discussed, with clear communication on what the tool can and cannot do in large, complex codebases.
