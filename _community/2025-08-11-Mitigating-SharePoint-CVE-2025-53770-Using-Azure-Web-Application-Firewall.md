# Mitigating SharePoint CVE-2025-53770 Using Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)

**Author:** yuvalpery

## Summary

Microsoft has disclosed [CVE-2025-53770](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53770), a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting on-premises SharePoint Server versions 2016, 2019, 2010, 2013, and Subscription Edition (SE). The vulnerability is exploited by chaining two issues—authentication bypass (CVE-2025-49706) and a deserialization flaw (CVE-2025-49704)—allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary C# code on affected servers.

### Impacted Versions and Patch Status

- **Patched:** SharePoint 2016, 2019, Subscription Edition (SE) — security updates available
- **Not Patched:** SharePoint 2010, 2013 — unsupported, remains vulnerable

### Attack Chain in Brief

1. **CVE-2025-49706 – Authentication Bypass**: Attackers send a specially crafted `POST` request to `/\_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx?DisplayMode=Edit&a=/ToolPane.aspx` using a manipulated `Referer` header (`/\_layouts/SignOut.aspx`), tricking SharePoint into authorizing the request.
2. **CVE-2025-49704 – Deserialization**: The attacker sends another `POST` to the same endpoint, this time with a serialized payload that extracts cryptographic keys from `web.config`. They then use these keys to craft a VIEWSTATE payload containing malicious C# code, which SharePoint executes.

## Microsoft's Recommended Response

- **Apply security updates** for supported versions immediately.
- **Isolate or upgrade legacy systems** (2010/2013) as they will not receive patches. Restrict network access if upgrades are not possible.
- **Consult Microsoft's official blog** for full mitigation steps: [Customer guidance for SharePoint vulnerability CVE-2025-53770](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/08/customer-guidance-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/).

## Defending with Azure Web Application Firewall (WAF)

To help detect and block exploitation attempts on SharePoint Servers, create a **custom WAF rule** that matches known attack patterns used for CVE-2025-53770.

### Example WAF Custom Rule Logic

- **Condition 1:** Request URI contains `/\_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx` or `/\_layouts/15/spinstall0.aspx`
- **Condition 2:** `Referer` header contains `/\_layouts/SignOut.aspx` or `/\_layouts/15/SignOut.aspx`

#### Sample JSON Rule

```json
{
  "customRules": [
    {
      "name": "CVE202553770",
      "priority": 100,
      "ruleType": "MatchRule",
      "action": "Block",
      "matchConditions": [
        {
          "matchVariables": [
            { "variableName": "RequestUri" }
          ],
          "operator": "Regex",
          "negationConditon": false,
          "matchValues": ["(?i)/_layouts(?:/\\d+)?/(SignOut|spinstall0|ToolPane)\\.aspx"],
          "transforms": []
        },
        {
          "matchVariables": [
            { "variableName": "RequestHeaders", "selector": "Referer" }
          ],
          "operator": "Regex",
          "negationConditon": false,
          "matchValues": ["(?i)/_layouts(?:/\\d+)?/(SignOut|spinstall0|ToolPane)\\.aspx"],
          "transforms": []
        }
      ],
      "skippedManagedRuleSets": [],
      "state": "Enabled"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

- **Patch immediately**: Update SharePoint 2016/2019/SE to the latest security releases.
- **Review WAF configuration**: Implement and test the provided Azure WAF custom rules to protect vulnerable endpoints.
- **Restrict legacy SharePoint server access**: Limit network exposure and plan migration away from unsupported versions.

## Additional Information

- Stay informed on the latest SharePoint vulnerabilities via Microsoft's Security Response Center.
- Regularly audit and update network security appliances to respond to emerging threats.
