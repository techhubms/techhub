In this post, amrohann presents Termix v1.2.0, a .NET-powered terminal file manager, highlighting major new features and installation tips.<!--excerpt_end-->

## About Termix v1.2.0

**Termix** is a terminal-based file navigator built using .NET. The latest release, version 1.2.0, brings several usability enhancements and new features designed to improve productivity for developers and terminal users.

### New Features in v1.2.0

- **Cut, Copy, Move, and Paste Workflows**: Perform file operations quickly with keyboard shortcuts:
  - Press `C` to copy the selected file or directory.
  - Press `X` to move the selected file or directory.
  - Press `P` to paste the pending copy or move operation into the current directory. The common workflow is to mark items for copy or move, navigate to the destination, and then paste.
- **Status Bar Indicators**: The status bar now displays a clear indicator ("Copy" or "Move") before completing your paste, making operations transparent.
- **Progress Bar for Large Operations**: A progress bar appears when handling large files, providing feedback on operation status.
- **More Stable Fuzzy Search**: Improved fuzzy search allows users to find files more reliably within the terminal UI.

### Installation and Updates

Get Termix installed or updated on your system using the dotnet global tool command:

- To install Termix for the first time:

  ```shell
  dotnet tool install --global Termix
  ```
