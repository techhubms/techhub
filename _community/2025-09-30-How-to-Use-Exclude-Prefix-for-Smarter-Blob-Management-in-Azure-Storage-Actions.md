# How to Use Exclude Prefix for Smarter Blob Management in Azure Storage Actions

Azure Storage Actions is a versatile platform enabling automated management of data in Azure Blob and Data Lake Storage. Among its key features, **Exclude Prefix** allows you to fine-tune automation jobs for better precision and data safety.

## What Is the Exclude Prefix Feature?

The **Exclude Prefix** option lets you omit specific blobs or folders from being targeted in Azure Storage Actions. This is helpful for scenarios such as:

- Moving blobs to a cooler tier while protecting important config or log files
- Deleting outdated blobs but keeping those matching certain paths
- Rehydrating archived blobs while excluding critical data
- Automating workflows on blob change events, only for selected containers or paths

**Example:**
If you need to archive blobs older than 30 days but want to exclude any log or config files from the process, you can add `logs/` or `config/` as prefixes in the exclusion list. This ensures automation does not touch those files or folders.

## Step-by-Step: Using Exclude Prefix in Azure Storage Actions

### 1. Create a Storage Task

- Go to the Azure portal and search for **Storage tasks**.
- Under **Services**, select **Storage tasks – Azure Storage Actions**.
- Click **Create** to begin configuring a new task.
- Fill out all required fields and proceed to the **Conditions** step.

### 2. Specify Task Conditions

To configure an action (e.g., deletion):

- Define your desired conditions on the **Conditions** page (such as deleting blobs with the access tier set to Hot).
- Add additional filter criteria as needed.

### 3. Add the Assignment

- Under **Select scope**, choose your subscription and storage account, and name the assignment.
- In **Role assignment**, select **Storage Blob Data Owner** to grant the task the necessary permissions.
- In **Filter objects**, set the **Exclude Blob Prefix** field to omit blobs or folders you do NOT want modified by this task (e.g., `excludefiles/`).

### 4. Task Trigger and Monitoring

- Define trigger details, such as execution schedule and report storage location.
- After deployment, view task status and reports through **Assignments** > **View task runs**.
- You can download comma-separated reports for review.

### 5. Enabling Task Assignments

- The **Enable task assignment** checkbox is checked by default, so assignments run automatically.
- If this box is unchecked, manually enable an assignment later from the **Assignments** page.

### 6. Alternative Exclusion via Conditions

- Beyond Exclude Prefix, you can use the **Not** operator (`!`) in task conditions to filter out blobs dynamically (e.g., exclude where blob name equals "Test").
- See [Multiple Clauses in a Condition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage-actions/storage-tasks/storage-task-conditions#multiple-clauses-in-a-condition) for advanced logic.

## Why Use Exclude Prefix?

- Prevent accidental modification or deletion of critical files
- Increase automation safety and operational reliability
- Enable granular, targeted management within large-scale blob or Data Lake environments
- Reduce errors and support compliance by protecting key data folders

## Conclusion

The **Exclude Prefix** property in Azure Storage Actions empowers you to automate data management tasks with precision. By defining exclusions, you can safeguard sensitive or mission-critical data while maintaining operational efficiency at scale.
