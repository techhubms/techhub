# Microsoft Security Exposure Management Ninja Training

A curated, practical roadmap to help you build in-depth expertise in Microsoft Security Exposure Management (MSEM), designed by YuriDiogenes. This guide is organized into progressive modules, covering everything from the fundamentals to advanced integrations and compliance strategies.

## What is Microsoft Security Exposure Management (MSEM)?

Microsoft Security Exposure Management helps organizations:

- Build and mature exposure management programs using continuous threat exposure management (CTEM) processes.
- Visualize and assess your organization's security risks across assets through real-time, inside-out and outside-in analysis.
- Identify and protect critical assets while understanding potential attacker intrusion paths and lateral movement risks.
- Clearly communicate risk metrics and insights to both technical and business stakeholders.
- Integrate with both Microsoft and third-party security solutions for comprehensive exposure analysis and incident remediation.

## Training Modules Overview

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Introducing Microsoft Security Exposure Management | Learn MSEM basics and primary use-case scenarios. |
| 2. Planning MSEM Adoption | Discover best practices for planning adoption, supported platforms, and operational considerations. |
| 3. Attack Surface Management Capabilities | Deep dive into threat path visualization, attack surface maps, and related features. |
| 4. Exposure Insights | Explore how to leverage metrics, recommendations, and event data for strengthening your security posture. |
| 5. First- and Third-Party Integrations | Understand extending capabilities using Microsoft and third-party connectors and tools (e.g., MDC, MDI, MDE, MDVM, EASM). |
| 6. Regulatory Compliance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Use compliance dashboards, integrate standards, and leverage Azure Blueprints. |
