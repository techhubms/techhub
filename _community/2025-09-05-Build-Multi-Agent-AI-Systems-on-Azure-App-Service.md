# Build Multi-Agent AI Systems on Azure App Service

## Introduction

Discover how to enhance your Azure App Service applications by integrating multi-agent AI architectures with technologies like Azure AI Foundry, Model Context Protocol (MCP), OpenAPI, and .NET Aspire. This guide walks through building a fashion e-commerce demo with multiple specialized AI agents, increased observability, and seamless cloud deployment.

## Key Technologies and Architecture

### Multi-Agent System Components

- **Main Orchestrator** manages workflow and inventory queries via MCP tools
- **Cart Manager** handles shopping cart operations through OpenAPI integrations
- **Fashion Advisor** provides personalized styling recommendations
- **Content Moderator** ensures safe, compliant user interactions

### Tooling and Integrations

- **MCP Tools**: Real-time external inventory connections using the Model Context Protocol
- **OpenAPI Tools**: Direct API links to App Service, enabling seamless agent actions
- **Connected Agent Tools**: Enable automatic, orchestrated communication between agents for more complex workflows

### .NET Aspire and Premium v4 App Service

- **.NET Aspire**: Enhances developer experience by providing built-in observability and cloud-native patterns, plus real-time telemetry in local development
- **App Service Premium v4**: Offers the most performant, scalable hosting for modern, AI-powered workloads

## Implementation Patterns

- **Incremental Enhancement**: Extend existing App Service infrastructure with multi-agent capabilities
- **Simple Integration**: Use familiar tools like `azd up` for environment and agent deployment
- **Production-Readiness**: Build on mature Azure services; easily extendable as new features emerge

## Step-By-Step Getting Started

1. **Clone the Sample**: Download code and resources from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/seligj95/app-service-aspire-eshop-agents)
2. **Quick Deploy**: Use `azd up` for one-command infrastructure setup
3. **Configure Agents**: Run the provided Python setup script to stand up your multi-agent environment
4. **Environment Linking**: Add a single environment variable to connect your agents
5. **Explore and Test**: Experiment with the provided sample conversations and observe agent orchestration in action

## Upcoming Features and Roadmap

- **MCP Authentication Integration**: Enhanced security with Azure Entra ID
- **Azure AI Foundry Updates**: New agent features, integration improvements, and model support
- **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper Azure Monitor and business intelligence integrations
- **Multi-Language Sample Expansion**: Support for more programming languages beyond .NET and Python
