# Exploring HPC and AI Innovation: Microsoft + AMD at HPC Roundtable 2025

On September 30th, 2025, the city of Turin will host the HPC Roundtable, a significant industry event focused on advancements in high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructure. The event draws leaders and practitioners from across industries to explore how cloud-native solutions are transforming engineering practices, simulations, and intelligent workloads.

## Microsoft and AMD at the Forefront

Microsoft, in partnership with AMD, will play a key role in the event. Their collaboration centers on bringing scalable, cloud-native HPC solutions to industries facing increasingly complex computing demands. The discussions will emphasize combining Microsoft Azure's robust cloud offerings with AMD's advanced hardware to meet the requirements of modern simulation and AI workloads.

## Featured Session: Polestar's CAE Journey with Azure HPC

A major highlight is the session "Driving Innovation – Polestar’s CAE Environment Journey with Microsoft Azure High Performance Computing (HPC)" by Peter Lee from Polestar. This presentation illustrates how Polestar modernized their Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) workflows using:

- Azure HB-series virtual machines powered by AMD
- Azure Managed Lustre for high-throughput parallel storage

By migrating from traditional on-premises systems to Azure, Polestar achieved greater scalability, improved agility, and optimized the performance/cost equation for simulation workloads—directly accelerating product development.

## Accelerating Intelligence: HPC and AI Roundtable

In a panel titled "Accelerating Intelligence with HPC and AI," Microsoft’s Wolfgang De Salvador (Product Manager, Azure Managed Lustre) will join industry thought leaders to discuss:

- The convergence of simulation and machine learning
- Hybrid compute environment evolution
- Future strategies for intelligent workload orchestration

The session aims to guide organizations reimagining their HPC strategies to better support both engineering and advanced AI workloads.

## Key Takeaways for Attendees

Participants will:

- Learn about cutting-edge Azure HPC solutions in real-world automotive and engineering contexts
- Discover the impact of cloud-native AI and simulation infrastructure
- Engage with Azure and AMD experts
- Network with peers shaping next-generation compute

## Event Details

- **Date:** September 30th, 2025
- **Location:** Turin, Italy
- **Organized by:** DoITNow
- **Target Audience:** Engineers, researchers, IT leaders, technologists interested in practical AI and HPC transformation
