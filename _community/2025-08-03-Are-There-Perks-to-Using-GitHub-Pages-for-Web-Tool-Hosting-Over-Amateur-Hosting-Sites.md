Qwert-4 asks about the advantages of using GitHub Pages versus other amateur hosting options for hosting simple web-based utilities, inviting a discussion on deployment choices.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Exploring GitHub Pages vs. Amateur Hosting Sites for Web Tools

**Author:** Qwert-4

### Context

The author has developed several simple web-based utilities using HTML and JavaScript. Traditionally, these kinds of tools are often hosted using GitHub Pages, as shown in their example: [utf-c](https://denull.github.io/utf-c/). However, the author is considering other hosting options for their personal websiteâ€”specifically platforms aimed at hobbyists and amateurs such as Neocities or Nekoweb.

### The Central Question

Is there a clear advantage to choosing GitHub Pages over services like Neocities or Nekoweb for hosting small, static web utilities focused on amateur audiences?

### Considerations & Discussion Points

- **GitHub Pages**
  - Simple, free hosting for static sites and web utilities.
  - Git-based version control and collaboration features.
  - Integration with the broader GitHub ecosystem, making it easy to open-source code and accept contributions.
  - Custom domains are available, and site updates are tied to repository changes.
  - Ideal for developers already familiar with GitHub workflows.

- **Neocities/Nekoweb**
  - Focused on communities and personal websites, especially for creative or amateur projects.
  - May offer more creative freedom in site structure and content presentation.
  - Often built around web self-expression and digital art communities.
  - May include web-based editors and a stronger sense of community or nostalgia.
  - Integration with version control or CI/CD workflows may be limited compared to GitHub.

- **Shared Factors**
  - Both types of services support static content (HTML, CSS, JS-based utilities).
  - Free to use for basic projects.
  - Suitable for sharing simple utilities with a public audience.

### Conclusion

The choice may come down to your priorities: If you value source control, collaboration, and integration with development workflows, GitHub Pages offers technical advantages. If your focus is on web creativity, personal expression, or community engagement, Neocities or Nekoweb might be preferable. Both are valid paths for sharing web-based tools with an amateur audience.
