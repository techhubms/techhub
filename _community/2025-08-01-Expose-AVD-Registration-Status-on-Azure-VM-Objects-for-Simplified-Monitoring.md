Vu_Hoang suggests exposing Azure Virtual Desktop registration status directly on Azure VM objects to streamline monitoring and automation in enterprise deployments.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Proposal: Surfacing AVD Registration Status on Azure VM Objects

**Author:** Vu_Hoang

### Context

In large enterprise environments, determining whether individual Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are properly registered with Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) can be challenging. Currently, administrators often have to query AVD host pools or rely on indirect metrics and status signals, which complicates monitoring and automation tasks.

### Proposal

Vu_Hoang recommends exposing the AVD registration status (such as Registered, Not Registered, Pending) as a field directly on the Azure VM object. The status should be accessible through multiple interfaces, including:

- Azure Portal UI
- Azure Resource Graph queries
- Azure PowerShell and CLI
- Azure Resource Manager REST API

### Benefits

- **Simplified Automation**: Registration status data would be available for programmatic access, allowing for streamlined automated workflows and scripts to detect and act upon registration states.
- **Operational Monitoring**: Easier monitoring of VM readiness and health in AVD environments, helping admins quickly identify and remediate unregistered or misconfigured VMs.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates management across large-scale deployments by exposing required data in one place.

### Use Cases

- Automated remediation scripts can detect VMs in a 'Not Registered' state and trigger corrective actions.
- Monitoring dashboards can easily visualize the AVD registration state for all VMs in an environment.
- Auditing and reporting on AVD infrastructure is simplified by direct query access to VM registration status fields.

### Request Summary

Surfacing the AVD registration status directly on Azure VM objects via built-in Azure tools and APIs would present significant operational advantages for enterprise customers. This feature would positively impact automation, monitoring, and troubleshooting processes in large-scale Azure Virtual Desktop implementations.
