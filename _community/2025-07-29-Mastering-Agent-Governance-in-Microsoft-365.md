In this comprehensive guide, Chad Stout walks IT leaders and compliance officers through a practical, phased approach to governing AI agents in Microsoft 365, especially in regulated industries.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

Chad Stout’s article presents a strategic, phased approach to governing AI agents within Microsoft 365, aimed at highly regulated industries such as Healthcare and Life Sciences (HLS). The content is aligned with Microsoft’s ‘Administering and Governing Agents’ guidance, focusing on risk mitigation and scalable innovation.

## Key Themes & Roadmap

### Why Governance Matters

- **Increased Agent Usage:** AI agents are becoming integral in regulated organizations, raising concerns about security, compliance, and data protection.
- **Strategic Imperative:** Governance ensures organizations can innovate with AI while meeting stringent regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).

### Phased Rollout Approach

#### Phase 1: Establish Governance Foundation

- **Build a champion team**—cross-functional, involving IT, compliance, clinical operations, and research.
- **Define objectives:** Identify risks (e.g., data breaches, unauthorized access) and desired outcomes.
- **Inventory agents:** Document tools and platforms in use (e.g., SharePoint, Copilot Studio, Azure AI).
- **Early compliance involvement:** Align with healthcare regulations from the outset.

#### Phase 2: Configure Core Controls

- **Microsoft 365 Admin Center:** Setup agent access, usage policies, lifecycle management.
- **Power Platform Admin Center:** Enforce DLP, environment controls, sharing restrictions.
- **Microsoft Purview:** Apply sensitivity labels and insider risk policies. Ensure secure environments for agents handling protected data.

#### Phase 3: Pilot with Guardrails

- **Limit rollout:** Start with a small, monitored group of makers and developers creating agents.
- **Controls:** Monitor behaviors, usage patterns, and potential oversharing.
- **Regular compliance/security reviews:** Begin with internal/non-critical workflows.

#### Phase 4: Train and Empower

- **Training programs:** Tailored for end users, makers, developers, and different business roles.
- **Center of Excellence (CoE):** Share templates, best practices, provide ongoing support.
- **Success stories:** Promote internal wins to sustain engagement.

#### Phase 5: Scale with Confidence

- **Expand development:** Safely foster agent adoption across departments.
- **Monitor and refine:** Use pay-as-you-go tracking, audit results, and feedback to optimize.
- **Proactive risk identification:** Leverage Microsoft Purview for continuous improvement.

## Business Impact and Closing Thoughts

- **Accelerate innovation** while ensuring compliance and security.
- **Reduce organizational risk** through managed, proactive governance.
- **Build trust** with stakeholders and regulators.
- **Continuous journey:** Governance needs ongoing updates, training, and adaptation as technologies and regulations evolve.
