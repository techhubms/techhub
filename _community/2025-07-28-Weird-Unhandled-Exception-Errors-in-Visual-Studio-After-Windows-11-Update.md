Quiet_Equivalent_569 details an issue with unhandled exceptions in Visual Studio after a Windows 11 update, looking for troubleshooting advice.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

Quiet_Equivalent_569 reports an ongoing issue with unhandled exception errors in Visual Studio following a Windows 11 update. The problem manifests only when running the project inside Visual Studioâ€”building the project succeeds, and running the executable directly from the terminal works as expected.

## Problem Details

- **Context:**
  - No changes have been made to the project that could explain the error's sudden appearance.
  - The issue began following a Windows 11 update.
  - Visual Studio was updated, and the .NET upgrade extension was installed. The project was upgraded accordingly.
  - The latest versions of the relevant framework and SDK from Microsoft were installed.
- **Behavior Observed:**
  - After these updates, the error resolved for a short time.
  - Upon restarting the computer, the error reappeared, reflecting the updated version.
  - The project continues to build successfully. Changes made to the project are reflected when running the build output directly from the terminal.
  - The unhandled exception error occurs only when launching the project from within Visual Studio (using 'Start without debugging').
- **Evidence:**
  - Several screenshots are provided that illustrate the errors and the installed versions.

## Attempts to Resolve

- Downloaded and installed the most recent SDK and framework versions.

These actions produced only a temporary solution; restarting the machine caused the issue to recur.
