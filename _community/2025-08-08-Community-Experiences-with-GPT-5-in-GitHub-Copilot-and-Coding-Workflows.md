# Community Experiences with GPT-5 in GitHub Copilot and Coding Workflows

**Author**: gullu_7278

This thread captures real-world, hands-on feedback from developers integrating GPT-5 into their coding routines, especially via GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code agents. Participants reflect on the technical nuances, speed/latency trade-offs, coding effectiveness, and comparison with other major LLMs such as Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 4.

## Developer Feedback Themes

### Coding Performance and Language Support

- GPT-5 is perceived as an improvement for React coding and out-of-the-box capability compared to previous versions (e.g., GPT-4.1).
- Experiences in ML and Data Science remain mixed; some see no significant jump over prior models like Sonnet 4.
- Comparative rankings and subjective impressions vary – e.g., Claude 4 > Gemini 2.5 Pro > GPT-5 for some workflows.
- GPT-5 closes the gap with Claude for code, but there is still a perceived difference.

### Workflow and Usability

- GitHub Copilot integration, especially via VS Code chat/agent mode, reveals some pain points:
  - Slowness: Minutes-long pauses as GPT-5 appears to scan large codebases with little user-visible output.
  - Trouble with specialized workflows: e.g., issues syncing tasks via markdown files and terminal commands.
  - Better UI design on certain tasks, but struggles with basic code edits and confirms.
- Copilot agent and settings: community requests for help with VS Code `settings.json` configurations not working as expected (`"chat.tools.autoApprove": true`, etc.).

### Cost and Value Assessment

- Premium token cost (1 per request) is a sticking point, especially compared to Claude.
- Some feel the performance difference doesn't justify the price versus earlier models.

### Mixed Success Stories

- Quick and impressive solutions on parsing bugs and UI redesigns.
- Some tasks suffer from sluggish response or overlong processing, occasionally degrading code quality versus earlier LLMs.
- General wait-and-see attitude pending rollout issues and wider adoption.

## Key Takeaways and Open Questions

- GPT-5 using Copilot is a step forward for some languages and tasks, but developer friction with speed and workflow breakages are notable.
- Price and usability are major deciding factors—many intend to keep comparing across models.
- Community members are troubleshooting and exploring agent configuration, seeking best practices.
