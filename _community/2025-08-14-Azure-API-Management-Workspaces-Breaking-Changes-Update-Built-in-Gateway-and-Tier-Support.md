# Update To API Management Workspaces Breaking Changes: Built-in Gateway & Tiers Support

## Overview

Microsoft has announced an update to previously communicated breaking changes around Azure API Management (APIM) workspaces. This specifically affects the use of preview workspaces on the built-in gateway.

## What’s Changing?

- **Continued support**: If your APIM instance uses preview workspaces on the built-in gateway and aligns with the new tier-based workspace limits, these workspaces will continue to operate unchanged. Additionally, such workspaces will automatically transition to general availability upon the formal release of built-in gateway support.
- **Workspace limits** are now tier-dependent:

  | API Management Tier     | Workspace Limit on Built-in Gateway |
  |------------------------|--------------------------------------|
  | Premium & Premium v2   | Up to 30 workspaces                   |
  | Standard & Standard v2 | Up to 5 workspaces                    |
  | Basic & Basic v2       | Up to 1 workspace                     |
  | Developer              | Up to 1 workspace                     |

## Why Is This Changing?

Microsoft initially required workspace gateways to improve reliability and scalability, especially in large or federated API environments. However, feedback from customers utilizing preview workspaces or operating in non-Premium tiers highlighted a continued need for built-in gateway support with workspaces. This rollback ensures existing workflows are maintained while still encouraging the use of workspace gateways where advanced scalability and isolation are needed.

## What’s Not Changing?

- Other aspects of the workspace-related breaking changes remain in effect.
- Service-level managed identities remain unavailable within workspaces.
- Premium and Premium v2 services continue to support both workspace models: built-in gateway and dedicated workspace gateways.
