# Building a Secure and Compliant Azure AI Landing Zone: Policy Framework & Best Practices

**Author:** Madhur_Shukla

## Overview

In an AI-first world, deploying AI and cognitive workloads without proper governance on Azure introduces security, compliance, and cost risks. This article walks through a practical approach to designing and deploying an enterprise-grade Policy & Compliance Framework for the Azure AI Landing Zone (AI ALZ), leveraging Policy as Code and automation to enforce guardrails at scale.

---

## Why Governance Matters for AI on Azure

- **Governance, compliance, and security** are foundational for any organization scaling AI on Azure. Lack of guardrails can lead to issues with data privacy, regulatory compliance, and uncontrolled cloud spend.

## About Azure AI Landing Zone (AI ALZ)

- AI ALZ is a Microsoft reference architecture that integrates core AI and ML services (Azure Machine Learning, Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services) with best practices in identity management, networking, operations, and governance.
- Provides a standardized, secure, and scalable baseline for deploying AI solutions in enterprise environments.

## Policy & Compliance Framework Architecture

- Azure Policy is the backbone of the AI ALZ governance model:
  - Policies: Define individual compliance rules.
  - Initiatives: Group sets of related policies.
  - Assignments: Apply these rules to resource groups/subscriptions.
  - Compliance Reporting: Tracks non-compliance for remediation.
- The framework applies to:
  - Azure Machine Learning (AML)
  - Azure API Management
  - Azure AI Foundry
  - Azure App Service
  - Azure Cognitive Services
  - Azure OpenAI
  - Azure Storage Accounts
  - Azure Databases (SQL, Cosmos DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Azure Kubernetes Service

## Core Policy Categories

1. **Networking & Access Control**
   - Restrict deployments to approved Azure regions.
   - Enforce Private Link/Endpoint for critical resources.
   - Disable public network access for workspaces, storage, key vaults.
2. **Identity & Authentication**
   - Require user-assigned managed identities.
   - Enforce authentication with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
   - Disable local authentication wherever possible.
3. **Data Protection**
   - Enforce encryption at rest with customer-managed keys (CMK).
   - Restrict all public access to storage and database resources.
4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Ensure diagnostic settings send logs to Log Analytics.
   - Require activity/resource logs to be enabled and retained.
5. **Resource-Specific Guardrails**
   - Built-in and custom policy initiatives across OpenAI, Kubernetes, App Services, Databases, and more.

## Policy Automation with Enterprise Policy as Code (EPAC)

- EPAC is a PowerShell toolkit to automate Azure Policy/Initiative/Assignment creation via code, supporting CI/CD integration through GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and more.
- Advantages:
  - Treat policy like application code (source-controlled, versioned)
  - Automatic ordering and dependency resolution
  - Desired state enforcement (ensures only approved policies are present)
  - Seamless integration with Azure Landing Zones governance baseline

## Implementation Steps

1. **Author Policy Definitions and Initiatives** in JSON/Excel.
2. **Store Policy Artifacts** in a code repository (e.g., GitHub).
3. **Configure EPAC** with CI/CD pipelines to deploy and manage policies.
4. **Monitor Compliance** using Azure Policy’s compliance dashboard.
5. **Iterate**: Update policies as new AI services or regulatory requirements arise.

## Wrap-up

This guide demonstrates that building and operating an AI Landing Zone on Azure is not just about deploying workloads—it's about ensuring responsible, secure, and compliant AI operations at scale. By adopting Policy as Code with EPAC, organizations can automate governance, stay compliant, and accelerate trustworthy AI adoption.
