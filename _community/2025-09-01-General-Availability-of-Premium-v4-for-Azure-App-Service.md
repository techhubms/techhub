# General Availability of Premium v4 for Azure App Service

Azure App Service Premium v4 is now generally available for both Windows and Linux customers. Premium v4 brings substantial improvements in platform performance, scalability, and cost effectiveness for running web applications at scale.

## Key Benefits

- Fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for web stacks on Windows and Linux
- Built with the latest AMD Dadsv6/Eadsv6 series hardware featuring NVMe temporary storage
- Enhanced performance: Up to 58% higher throughput and lower response times compared to earlier plans
- New pricing optimized for large-scale app modernization
- Additional reliability with features like integrated monitoring, deployment slots, and zone resilience
- Multiple SKU options from 1 vCPU/4GB (P0v4) up to 32 vCPUs/256GB (P5mv4)

## Performance and Load Testing Results

Recent comparative load tests between Premium v4 and Premium v3 revealed:

| SKU     | CPU Utilization | Throughput (RPS) | Pv4 vs Pv3 Throughput | Response Time (p90) |
|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| P1v3    | 77.3%          | 817              |                      | 20 ms               |
| **P1v4**    | 78.8%          | **1295**         | **+58.5% higher**    | **17 ms**           |
| P1mv3   | 79.6%          | 1048             |                      | 17 ms               |
| **P1mv4**   | 79.5%          | **1329**         | **+26.8% higher**    | **16 ms**           |

- Test site: Classic ASP.NET app used in lab settings, with simple .aspx pages and no external dependencies.
- Load was generated using Azure App Testing in the same Azure region for reliable measurements.
- All load scenarios were targeted at ~80% CPU utilization on a single instance to estimate real-world performance.

*Note: Hardware used for these comparisons was Standard_D2d_v4 for P1v3 and Standard_D2ads_v6 for P1v4; Standard_E2ads_v5 for P1mv3 and Standard_E2ads_v6 for P1mv4.*
