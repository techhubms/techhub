# Sprint Planning and Capacity Management in Azure DevOps Without Predefined Tasks

**Author:** TimePerfect8403

Migrating your team's workflow to Azure DevOps can be challenging, especially when it comes to planning sprints and measuring capacity. The scenario discussed here involves:

- Requests are triaged and estimated using story points.
- User stories are assigned to team members, who define tasks during the sprint as they work.
- Hours are recorded post-completion for each ticket.
- Management wants greater visibility into the progress of individual stories.

### Key Challenge

Azure DevOps typically measures sprint capacity based on hours linked to tasks. However, this team’s process creates tasks dynamically during the sprint, not before planning. This creates a disconnect between story point-based planning and hour-based capacity tracking.

### Practical Solutions in Azure DevOps

- **Use Backlog Forecasting:**
  - In the backlog view, enable the **Forecasting** feature (found in the backlog's view options).
  - This predicts how many stories can fit in a sprint based on historical story point capacity, helping you plan sprints even when tasks aren’t pre-defined.
- **Assign Stories to Sprints:**
  - During sprint planning, select the user stories you want and add them to the upcoming sprint, using story points and forecast lines as your guide.
- **Granular Progress Tracking:**
  - Members can create tasks under user stories during the sprint to represent work steps, making progress transparent for managers.
- **Capacity Tracking by Story Points:**
  - Use forecasted story point totals as your main planning metric, rather than hours.
  - Record hours spent at the sprint's end by aggregating the hours logged on tasks created during execution.
  - This approach aligns with agile best practices and avoids the inefficiency of estimating every task upfront.

### Agile Perspective

The discussion highlights:

- **Azure DevOps is optimized for agile workflows** (user stories, story points, adaptive planning).
- Task-level hour capacity is mainly for teams with more traditional or waterfall practices.
- Teams should avoid the 'estimation trap'—overemphasizing accuracy in hour tracking can undermine agile delivery and trust [(read more)](https://preview.nkdagility.com/resources/blog/the-estimation-trap-how-tracking-accuracy-undermines-trust-flow-and-value-in-software-delivery/).

### Summary of Recommendations

- Rely on user stories and story point forecasting for sprint planning.
- Add granular tasks during the sprint for progress tracking, not up-front estimation.
- Use Azure DevOps forecasting tools to visualize sprint capacity and planning boundaries.
- Focus on flow and value delivery over precise upfront task-hours.
