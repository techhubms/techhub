blabmight shares the release of Xams, an open-source ASP.NET Core and React framework designed for streamlined business app development.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

In this article, author blabmight announces the open-source release of Xams, a full-stack development framework built with ASP.NET Core and React. Xams is engineered to accelerate the creation of internal business applications that have recurring needs such as user management, record ownership, scheduled background jobs, and repetitive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) scaffolding.

## Motivation and Features

- **Streamlined Development**: Xams automates much of the repetitive setup and code commonly required in business applications, reducing boilerplate and manual coding for features like user roles and data ownership.
- **Enterprise Readiness**: The framework has already been used in several production applications, including projects for enterprise clients, demonstrating reliability and scalability for real-world use cases.
- **Open Source and Transparent**: Xams avoids proprietary components or black boxes. Developers can inspect, modify, and extend the framework as needed for their projects.
- **Developer Experience**: Emphasis is placed on maintaining a clean and familiar technology stack, making it easy for those already using ASP.NET Core and React to adopt Xams.

## Community Invitation

blabmight invites the developer community to provide feedback on Xams regarding its architecture, developer experience, and effectiveness in addressing common business app challenges. A short demo video (about 90 seconds) is provided to showcase the development flow and core features, encouraging further exploration and adoption.

## Conclusion

Xams aims to provide a robust starting point for internal business app development with a familiar and open approach, allowing teams to focus on unique features and logic rather than boilerplate scaffolding. Community feedback is encouraged to shape its future direction.
