In this article, shifty303, an experienced enterprise developer, discusses their hands-on use of GitHub Copilot and Claude 4, highlighting how expertise and thoughtful planning are essential when leveraging AI tools for software development. The author offers practical advice on prompt crafting, solution architecture, and avoiding common pitfalls encountered by less experienced developers.<!--excerpt_end-->

### Effective Use of Copilot in Software Development: Lessons from Experience

shifty303, a developer with over 15 years in the enterprise space, shares firsthand insights on maximizing productivity with GitHub Copilot, noting that it provides the desired outcome over 90% of the time and saves several hours daily. Currently, the author uses Copilot 4.1 alongside Claude 4, balancing architectural responsibilities, feature work, and bug fixes. With a background largely in backend (.NET) and significant frontend (Angular) experience, shifty303 emphasizes that true value from Copilot comes from thoughtful application.

#### Key Points

- **Human-Driven Architecture:** Major decisions like design patterns and architecture are made by the developer, not by Copilot.
- **Planning is Crucial:** Running proofs-of-concept (PoCs) and thoroughly considering testability and maintenance lead to better outcomes.
- **AI as an Assistant:** Copilot is most effective for busy workâ€”filling in details, adapting templates, and supporting implementation based on a solid plan.
- **Prompt Engineering Matters:** Clear, contextual, and structured prompts result in much better AI assistance. Providing method stubs with meaningful names and comments helps Copilot excel.
- **Challenges for Less Experienced Developers:** Juniors (and some seniors) often misuse Copilot by giving vague, context-free prompts, expecting the AI to autonomously design solutions, which leads to subpar results.

#### Practical Advice

- Plan work thoroughly before involving Copilot.
- Write down flows and provide intentional comments or method stubs as a guide.
- Use Copilot to automate repetitive or mechanical coding tasks after architectural decisions have been made.
- Avoid relying on AI to make critical decisions or design solutions from scratch.

The author humorously concludes with a caution: poorly planned, AI-built applications can become technical debt nightmares for support teams. Experience, planning, and appropriate use of AI tools are essential for long-term success.
