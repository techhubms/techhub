# What’s New in FinOps Toolkit 12 – July 2025

**Author:** Michael Flanakin  
**Published:** August 6, 2025

FinOps Toolkit 12 delivers a comprehensive set of enhancements for practitioners aiming to optimize their cloud investments in the Microsoft ecosystem. This release brings updates spanning data schema support, analytics, automation, network configuration, and security. Here are the highlights:

---

## Overview: The FinOps Toolkit and Its Role

The FinOps Toolkit is an open-source suite for learning, implementing, and automating cloud financial operations (FinOps) using Microsoft Azure. It enables teams to maximize cloud value, analyze spending, automate data pipelines, and reduce operational friction.

## Key Updates in Version 12

### 1. FOCUS 1.2 Support and Schema Enhancements

- The toolkit now supports the **FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS) 1.2**, enabling improved multi-cloud and multi-currency reporting via Microsoft Cost Management.
- Updates include new metadata, column additions/renames (such as ServiceSubcategory, InvoiceId, PricingCurrency, and SkuMeter), and provisions for future columns (e.g., CapacityReservationId).
- Guides link to transition, validate, and map cost data to FOCUS, minimizing friction in the migration process:  
  - [Update reports to use FOCUS columns](https://learn.microsoft.com/cloud-computing/finops/focus/mapping?WT.mc_id=finops-250528-micflan)  
  - [Convert cost and usage data to FOCUS](https://learn.microsoft.com/cloud-computing/finops/focus/convert?WT.mc_id=finops-250528-micflan)  
  - [Validate FOCUS data](https://learn.microsoft.com/cloud-computing/finops/focus/validate?WT.mc_id=finops-250528-micflan)

### 2. FinOps Hubs Schema v1_2

- A new schema version, **v1_2**, debuts in FinOps hubs, aligning data ingestion and reporting to FOCUS 1.2.
- Backward compatibility is maintained via versioned functions. Users are guided to adopt these for stable reporting and automation.

More details: [Introducing non-breaking “breaking” changes in FinOps hubs 12](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/finopsblog/introducing-non-breaking-%E2%80%9Cbreaking%E2%80%9D-changes-in-finops-hubs-12/4438554)

### 3. Flexible CIDR Support for VNets

- Network deployment is now more adaptable, allowing custom CIDR block ranges (/8 to /26) for private endpoints and Power BI data gateways. This increases compatibility and helps avoid deployment blockers for diverse organizational needs.

### 4. Azure Data Explorer Auto-Start

- Cost optimization improves via pipeline automation: when new data arrives, the pipeline checks and starts Data Explorer clusters if they’re paused, minimizing manual intervention and unnecessary cloud costs.
- Detailed operational status and errors are surfaced in Azure Data Factory’s monitoring interface for transparency.
- Reference: [Automatic stop of inactive Azure Data Explorer clusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/auto-stop-clusters)

### 5. Improved Security and Permissions Handling

- Managed exports now default to disabled, simplifying deployments in secure environments by removing the need for elevated (User Access Administrator) permissions unless explicitly required.
- Users can enable managed exports per deployment scenario.

### 6. Power BI Reporting Enhancements

- A new **Executive Summary** page in the Cost summary report aggregates key metrics for decision-makers: top subscriptions, resource groups, and services by spend, with visual analytics for actionable insights.
- The original summary is renamed to **Running total**, maintaining ongoing spend tracking.
- KQL and Power BI reports updated to leverage new data schemas for deeper insights.

### 7. PowerShell and Automation Updates

- PowerShell commands for Cost Management exports now default to the 2025-03-01 API version, ensuring alignment with the latest Azure Cost Management capabilities.
- FOCUS export version updated to 1.2-preview, making it easier to access the newest industry data features.
- Override dataset version quickly by setting `-DatasetVersion` as needed.

### 8. Minor Improvements and Documentation

- Expanded guidance on savings calculations and troubleshooting.
- More resource types and service mappings supported in open data modules.
- Direct links to the latest MS Learn documentation for deployment and optimization.

## What’s Next for FinOps Toolkit

Upcoming updates focus on greater automation, expanded reporting, continuous data model improvement, and integration of Azure Optimization Engine capabilities into the toolkit. Expect recurring updates to Power BI workbooks and community-driven feature enhancements.
