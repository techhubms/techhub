# Troubleshooting Azure Stack HCI Local Cluster Deployment: Network Configuration Error

**Author:** JensI

## Issue Description

While attempting to deploy an Azure local cluster using Azure Stack HCI, the cluster creation process fails with a network configuration error. Notably, all previous setup steps, including network configuration, completed successfully.

**Error Message Summary:**

```
Type 'ConfigCluster' of Role 'Cluster' raised an exception: Check the spelling of the cluster name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. Make sure the cluster nodes are turned on and connected to the network or contact your network administrator. at SetClusterLiveDumpPolicy, C:\NugetStore\Microsoft.AzureStack.Fabric.Storage.SCPSModule.10.2507.1001.1000\content\CloudDeployment\Classes\Cluster\Cluster.psm1: line 898 at ConfigCluster, C:\NugetStore\Microsoft.AzureStack.Fabric.Storage.SCPSModule.10.2507.1001.1000\content\CloudDeployment\Classes\Cluster\Cluster.psm1: line 322 at , C:\CloudDeployment\ECEngine\InvokeInterfaceInternal.psm1: line 163 at Invoke-EceInterfaceInternal, C:\CloudDeployment\ECEngine\InvokeInterfaceInternal.psm1: line 158 at , : line 50
```

## Observations

- The error message is generic and does not point to a specific cluster node or configuration step.
- The cluster name is assigned from Azure and was validated, reducing the likelihood of a naming issue.
- All networking steps prior to this error completed without failures.

## Troubleshooting Suggestions

- Double-check that all cluster nodes are powered on and reachable on the network.
- Verify that the cluster name matches exactly what Azure expects.
- Confirm no DNS or IP conflicts are present in the environment.
- Review the referenced PowerShell scripts (`Cluster.psm1`) at the specified lines for potential issues.
- Investigate Azure Stack HCI logs for more detailed error output.

## Next Steps

- Reach out to the Azure Stack HCI user community or Microsoft support if standard troubleshooting does not resolve the issue.
