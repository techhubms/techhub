Authored by DoodleMoodle542, this article details a practical workflow for web agencies: from building client sites on Lovable.dev to deploying on Vercel, managing domains, and efficiently transferring ownership.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Step-by-Step Workflow for Web Agency Projects

**Author: DoodleMoodle542**

This guide describes an effective order of operations for agencies building and deploying client websites. The workflow ensures smooth setup, deployment, and transfer of ownership, with all technical steps included.

### 1. Build the Website on Lovable.dev

- Create your client's site using Lovable.dev under your agency account.
- When finished, export the complete site code. You have two options:
  - Export directly to your GitHub repository, or
  - Export to a ZIP file and upload it manually to GitHub.

### 2. Deploy the Site on Vercel

- Set up a free Vercel account (if you haven't already).
- Connect your GitHub repository containing the website code to Vercel.
- Vercel will automatically deploy the site, providing a preview URL in the format `yourproject.vercel.app`.

### 3. Buy and Connect a Domain

- Determine domain purchasing responsibility:
  - Your agency can purchase the domain (using a registrar like Namecheap or GoDaddy), **or**
  - The client purchases the domain and grants you access to their registrar account.
- In the Vercel dashboard, navigate to your project’s **Settings > Domains**.
- Connect the new domain for the project.
- Update the domain's DNS settings to point to Vercel's servers. Vercel provides necessary DNS configuration instructions.

### 4. Transfer Project Ownership to the Client

- Ask the client to register for a Vercel account if they don't already have one.
- In the Vercel dashboard, select your project and go to **Settings > Transfer Project**.
- Enter the client’s email, associated with their Vercel account, and confirm the transfer.
  - As a result:
    - The client’s Vercel account receives ownership of the live website.
    - The GitHub repository stays connected.
    - The custom domain remains configured.
    - SSL remains enabled and valid.

### Result: Client Independence

Your client now has complete ownership and control over their live website, including code updates, domain management, and SSL.

This structured process standardizes agency project delivery, automates deployments, and ensures smooth transitions for both the agency and the client.
