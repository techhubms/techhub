# Azure AI Blogs Consolidated into the New Azure AI Foundry Blog

**Author:** GalimahB  
**Published:** August 13, 2025

## What’s Changed

Multiple Azure AI technical blogs—including the AI Platform Blog, Azure AI Services Blog, and Azure Machine Learning Blog—have now been integrated into the new [Azure AI Foundry Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry). This unification means there's now a single destination for all technical news, tutorials, and announcement posts related to Azure AI.

## Seamless Access to Past Content

All legacy blog content has been migrated to the new Azure AI Foundry Blog archive. Old links and bookmarks will redirect automatically, maintaining access to previous articles and resources.

## Subscription Update Required

Email and RSS subscriptions from legacy blogs did not automatically transfer. Followers of the former AI Platform, Azure AI Services, and Machine Learning blogs must re-subscribe to the Azure AI Foundry Blog to continue receiving updates. Use the Follow button on the [Azure AI Foundry Blog homepage](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry) to stay informed about the latest content.

## Looking Ahead

The consolidation aims to streamline the reader’s experience, providing a clearer and more unified perspective on Azure AI tools and innovations. Additional resources for the Azure AI community are provided:

- [Azure Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/)
- [DevBlogs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/)
- [Discord: Azure AI Foundry](https://discord.gg/azureaifoundry)
- [GitHub Resources](https://github.com/resources/articles)

The Azure AI team thanks readers for their ongoing support during this transition and looks forward to delivering new content and insights as a cohesive community resource.
