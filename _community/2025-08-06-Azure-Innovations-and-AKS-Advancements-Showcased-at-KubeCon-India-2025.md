# Azure at KubeCon India 2025: Innovations in AKS and Cloud-Native Operations

**Author:** coryskimming  
**Event:** KubeCon + CloudNativeCon India 2025  
**Location:** Hyderabad, India  
**Dates:** August 6-7, 2025

## Introduction

Microsoft, as a Gold sponsor at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon India 2025, unveiled substantial advancements to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). These enhancements span AI-driven operations, improved networking, robust security features, and streamlined management at scale. Below, we summarize the highlights and actionable news for Azure and Kubernetes professionals.

---

## Innovate with AI

- **AKS Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**: Now in public preview, MCP abstracts Kubernetes and Azure APIs, making it easier for intelligent AI agents to manage clusters and automate diagnostics across multi-cluster environments.
- **AI Native Support in AKS**: Offers direct integration routes for AI-powered tools within Kubernetes workflows, furthering AI-driven DevOps and automation.

## Enhanced Networking Capabilities

- **Layer-7 Network Policies**: Precisely control traffic between AKS services based on HTTP methods, hosts, and paths, promoting stronger zero-trust architectures. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/container-network-security-l7-policy-concepts)
- **HTTP Proxy Management**: Simplifies proxy settings cluster-wide, including straightforward proxy disabling options [Details](https://aka.ms/aks/http-proxy).
- **Azure Bastion Integration**: Enables secure kubectl access to private AKS clusters without VPNs or public endpoints [Details](https://aka.ms/bastionforaks).
- **LocalDNS for AKS**: Improves DNS reliability within clusters, maintaining name resolution during upstream outages [Details](https://aka.ms/aks-localdns).
- **Static Egress IP Prefixes**: Ensures predictable outbound IPs for compliance and integration [Details](https://aka.ms/aks-static-egress-gateway).
- **Multiple Standard Load Balancers**: Supports assigning dedicated SLBs to node pools/services, increasing network scalability [Details](https://aka.ms/aks/multiple-standard-load-balancers).
- **Virtual Network Verifier**: Built-in tool for automated network health checks and troubleshooting [Details](https://aka.ms/aks/virtual-network-verifier).

## Strengthen Security Posture

- **Confidential VMs (Azure Linux/Ubuntu 24.04)**: Leverage hardware-encrypted VMs for sensitive workloads using AMD SEV-SNP, ensuring in-use and at-rest encryption without code changes [Details](https://aka.ms/aks/cvm).
- **Encryption in Transit for NFS**: Data between pods and Azure Files NFS is secured using TLS 1.3 [Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/encryption-in-transit-for-nfs-shares?tabs=azure-portal%2CUbuntu).
- **Web Application Firewall for Containers**: OWASP-based WAF protection for container workloads via Azure Application Gateway [Details](https://aka.ms/agc/waf).
- **AKS Security Dashboard**: Unified view in Azure Portal for vulnerabilities, compliance, and runtime threat management, powered by Defender for Cloud [Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/cluster-security-dashboard).

## Streamlined Operations and Scalability

- **Node Auto-Provisioning**: Automatically scales standalone AKS nodes in response to load, no manual node pool management required [Details](https://aka.ms/aks/nap).
- **Deployment Safeguards**: Validates and optionally auto-corrects Kubernetes manifests to ensure best practices and reduce risks [Details](https://aka.ms/aks/deployment-safeguards).
- **Managed Namespaces**: Unified namespace management across multiple clusters with seamless access from CLI, API, or Portal [Details](https://aka.ms/aks/managed-namespaces).

## Performance and Observability Enhancements

- **Prometheus Quotas in Azure Monitor**: Raised to 20M samples/minute for full coverage in large AKS clusters.
- **Control Plane Efficiency**: Kubernetes enhancement (KEP-5116) reduces memory usage and improves kubectl API server performance in AKS versions 1.31.9+.

## Microsoft at KubeCon India 2025: Session Highlights

- **Booth G4**: Live demos, AKS expertise, and Azure technical Q&A.
- **Breakout Sessions by Microsoft Engineers:**
