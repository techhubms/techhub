# General Availability of Teams Phone Extensibility with Azure Communication Services

**Author:** Ankur Agarwal

## Overview

Teams Phone extensibility (TPE), now generally available, allows organizations and developers to enhance Microsoft Teams telephony using Azure Communication Services (ACS). This closes the gap between Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) and Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS), providing a streamlined, AI-enabled, and highly customizable telephony platform.

## Key Benefits

- **Unified Telephony for UCaaS and CCaaS:** Leverage existing Teams Phone infrastructure for contact centers, reducing setup complexity.
- **Conversational AI Integration:** Use ACS Call Automation APIs and OpenAI services to introduce AI-powered features—personalized greetings, voice recognition, and automated workflows.
- **Advanced Call Control:** Integrate features such as intelligent call routing, mid-call participant management, and convenience recording, all within Teams.
- **Cost Efficiency & Geographic Reach:** Build on existing Teams investments, benefit from global calling plans, and deploy without extra direct routing or service numbers unless needed.
- **Provisioning & Extensibility:** Easily connect CCaaS platforms to Teams tenants, enabling rapid onboarding and integration.

## Developer Capabilities

- **Call Automation APIs:** Build intelligent IVRs, automate call flows, and control calls server-side. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/call-automation/call-automation)
- **Client SDK:** Develop custom CCaaS clients or embed telephony into applications. [See features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features)
- **Telemetry and Diagnostics:** Access advanced logging and real-time call analytics via Azure Portal for quality assurance and troubleshooting.

## AI Insights Features (Public Preview)

- **Automated Meeting Summaries:** AI generates concise call recaps in real time, highlighting key decisions and action items.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects participant emotional tone to support agents and enable proactive interventions.
- **PII Redaction:** Automatically masks sensitive data during calls to maintain compliance and privacy.
- **Language Detection:** Real-time identification of spoken languages, enabling seamless multilingual interactions.
