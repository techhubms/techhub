Authored by Cobuter_Man, this article details a strategy for enhancing planning and brainstorming workflows in AI IDEs like VS Code with Copilot by applying Chain-of-Thought techniques to non-thinking models using the APM Agent Mode.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

Cobuter_Man investigates methods to enhance planning and brainstorming in AI-enabled IDEs, specifically focusing on environments like Visual Studio Code integrated with GitHub Copilot or alternatives such as Cursor. The article describes experiments forcing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities onto non-thinking AI models, notably using the Sonnet 4 model.

## Technique: Forcing CoT in Non-Thinking Models

Instead of relying on expensive, advanced "thinking" models, the article demonstrates that by cleverly structuring prompts—particularly through the [Agentic Project Management (APM) v0.4 Setup Agent](https://github.com/sdi2200262/agentic-project-management)—users can turn the chat interface into the model's 'thinking' area. Subsequently, all well-formed planning decisions are documented in a separate Implementation Plan.

### Process

- **Prompting within Agent Mode:** Specific APM prompts guide the model to use chat as a reasoning process, externalizing planning decisions that are typically handled internally by 'thinking' models.
- **Single-Request Efficiency:** All planning and implementation are handled in one cohesive request, delivering a streamlined workflow.
- **Cost Efficiency:** This method makes it possible to get near-"thinking model" capability at a lower cost by cleverly utilizing non-thinking models.

## Results and Considerations

- **Substantial Performance Improvement:** The improved process enhances project management and ideation speed without requiring higher-cost AI models.
- **Compliance:** The article notes that this approach aligns with usage Terms & Conditions since it simply leverages prompt engineering and APM's structured workflow.

## Tools and Technologies Covered

- **GitHub Copilot** (with Agent Mode)
- **VS Code and Cursor IDEs**
- **Sonnet 4 non-thinking model**
- **Agentic Project Management (APM) repository**
