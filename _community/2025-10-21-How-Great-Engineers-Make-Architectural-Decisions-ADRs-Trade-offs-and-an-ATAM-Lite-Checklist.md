# How Great Engineers Make Architectural Decisions — ADRs, Trade-offs, and an ATAM-Lite Checklist

Every engineering choice involves balancing trade-offs—such as reliability versus cost, performance versus maintainability, or speed versus safety. Instead of seeking perfect outcomes, effective engineers make informed, transparent decisions and document their reasoning for future teams.

## Why Decision-Making Matters

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the reasoning, context, and trade-offs behind technical decisions. This shared record:

- Lives alongside code in the repository
- Explains reasoning in plain language
- Survives personnel and version changes, becoming the engineering team's memory

## The Five Pillars of Trade-offs: Azure Well-Architected Framework

At Microsoft, all major design discussions leverage the Azure Well-Architected Framework, evaluating against five key pillars:

1. **Reliability** – System resilience and recovery from failures
2. **Performance Efficiency** – Latency and throughput targets
3. **Cost Optimization** – Efficient resource use
4. **Security** – Limiting blast radius and exposure
5. **Operational Excellence** – Deployment, monitoring, and fast recovery

No single decision perfectly optimizes all five, so documenting conscious trade-offs is critical.

## A Practical Decision Flow

1. **Frame It:** Clarify the problem, constraints, and quality goals (e.g., SLOs, cost caps)
2. **List Options:** Identify 2-4 viable approaches
3. **Score Trade-offs:** Use a Decision Matrix to rate each option against the five pillars
4. **ATAM-Lite Review:** List scenarios, sensitivity points, and risks
5. **Record It as an ADR:** Document everything as a markdown file in the code repository

### Example Table

| Step                  | What to Do                                             | Output             |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Frame It              | Clarify problem, constraints, quality goals            | Problem statement  |
| List Options          | Identify 2-4 realistic approaches                     | Options list       |
| Score Trade-offs      | Decision Matrix (rate 1–5 against pillars)             | Table of scores    |
| ATAM-Lite Review      | List scenarios, sensitivity points, risks              | Risk notes         |
| Record It as an ADR   | Document in markdown next to code                      | ADR file           |

## Example: Adding a Read-Through Cache

- **Decision:** Add a Redis cache in front of Cosmos DB to reduce read latency
- **Context:** Average P95 latency from DB is 80 ms (goal: less than 15 ms)
- **Options:**
  - A) Query DB directly
  - B) Add read-through cache using Redis

**Trade-offs:**

- *Performance:* Massive improvement in read speed
- *Cost:* Fewer RU/s consumed on Cosmos DB
- *Reliability:* Risk of stale data if cache invalidation fails
- *Operational:* More complexity (need for monitoring, TTLs)

## Templates You Can Re-use

### ADR Template

```
# ADR-001: Add Read-through Cache in Front of Cosmos DB

Status: Accepted
Date: 2025-10-21
Context: High read latency; P95 = 80ms, target <15ms
Options:
A) Direct DB reads
B) Redis cache for hot keys ✅
Decision: Adopt Redis cache for performance and cost optimization.
Consequences:
- Improved read latency and reduced RU/s cost
- Risk of data staleness during cache invalidation
- Added operational complexity

### Decision Matrix Example

| Pillar               | Weight | Option A | Option B | Notes                              |
|----------------------|--------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Reliability          | 5      | 3        | 4        | Redis clustering handles failover   |
| Performance          | 4      | 2        | 5        | In-memory reads                     |
| Cost                 | 3      | 4        | 5        | Reduced RU/s                        |
| Security             | 4      | 4        | 4        | Same authentication posture         |
| Operational Excellence| 3     | 4        | 3        | More moving parts                   |

*Weighted total = Σ(weight × score); highest score indicates best option*

## Team Guidelines for ADRs

- Store ADRs in a `/docs/adr` folder within each code repository
- One ADR per major change; supersede outdated ones instead of editing history
- Link relevant ADRs in design reviews and pull requests
- Revisit ADRs when constraints change (incidents, new SLOs, cost shifts)
- Publish lessons learned as follow-up knowledge sharing posts

## Why It Works

Recording decisions with ADRs, rated against Azure Well-Architected pillars and reviewed through a lightweight ATAM process, aligns team culture with reliability and transparency. This practice supports onboarding, accelerates design reviews, and provides traceable technical history.
