# Mistral Document AI Launches on Azure AI Foundry: Seamless Document Intelligence at Scale

**Author:** Naomi Moneypenny

## Overview

Microsoft has partnered with Mistral AI to bring Mistral Document AI into the Azure AI Foundry ecosystem. This integration allows developers and enterprises to deploy and manage a powerful, multimodal document intelligence model as a serverless REST API—fully hosted and managed in Azure, with enterprise-grade security, compliance, and monitoring.

## Why Mistral Document AI?

Modern enterprises struggle with unlocking value from unstructured documents such as contracts, invoices, and research papers. Mistral Document AI is designed to:

- Parse complex layouts, including tables, charts, LaTeX, and preserve original formatting
- Handle scanned images and PDFs with a multimodal AI (vision + language understanding)
- Support dozens of languages, making it suitable for global organizations
- Output structured results (e.g., JSON) for downstream integration or AI pipelines (including Retrieval-Augmented Generation [RAG])

## Key Capabilities

- **Document Parsing:** Interprets varied and complex document structures, including tables and mathematical content
- **Multilingual & Multimodal:** Understands and processes text, imagery, and different writing systems
- **Structured Output:** Outputs document data in formats suitable for automation and further analysis
- **Serverless Deployment:** Deploy via Azure AI Foundry with minimal infrastructure effort
- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Data remains within your Azure account/region with robust compliance support
- **Responsible AI Integration:** Use Azure’s compliance, content filtering, and monitoring out-of-the-box
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Detailed tracking for API usage, latency, and operational health
- **Agent Integration:** Connects with Azure AI Agent Service for intelligent workflow automation

## Example Use Cases

- **Digitizing Paper Archives:** Convert scanned PDFs and handwritten forms to machine-readable records
- **Knowledge Extraction:** Automate extraction from research, manuals, or customer documents
- **AI Pipelines & RAG:** Feed structured document data into Q&A, summarization, or custom AI agents
- **Secure Handling for Regulated Industries:** Ideal for banking, healthcare, or any use case with data sovereignty or compliance requirements

## Getting Started

**1. Prepare Your Azure Environment**

- Ensure you have an Azure subscription (pay-as-you-go, not a free trial)
- In the Azure portal, create an AI Foundry hub and add a project

**2. Deploy the Model**

- In the AI Foundry Model Catalog, search for "mistral-document-ai-2505"
- Click Deploy and select your preferred pricing plan (Global or Regional)

**3. Call the API**

- After deployment, access the serverless REST API endpoint
- Make API calls from your preferred programming language or CLI tool (e.g., cURL)

**4. Integrate Into Workflows**

- Use structured outputs for archiving, search, RAG, automation, or feeding other AI systems
- Monitor usage and performance via Azure Foundry's observability tools
- Apply Responsible AI practices with built-in Azure tools

## Pricing (Aug 2025)

| Model                       | Price per 1K pages |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| mistral-document-ai-2505 Global   | $3               |
| mistral-document-ai-2505 Regional | $3.3             |
