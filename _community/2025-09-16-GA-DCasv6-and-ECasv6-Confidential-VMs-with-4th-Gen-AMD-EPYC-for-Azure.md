# GA: DCasv6 and ECasv6 Confidential VMs with 4th Gen AMD EPYC for Azure

**Author:** Rakeshginjupalli

Azure has introduced the DCasv6 and ECasv6 confidential VM series, now generally available in the UAE North and Korea Central regions. These VMs leverage 4th Generation AMD EPYC™ processors and incorporate Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) technology to enhance security and performance for sensitive workloads.

## Key Features

- **Hardware-rooted attestation**: Verifies VM integrity at the hardware level.
- **Memory encryption**: Protects confidential information in multi-tenant environments with AES-256 by default.
- **Enhanced data confidentiality**: Protects data from cloud operators, administrators, and insider threats.
- **Online key rotation**: Allows organizations to update encryption keys on-the-fly for dynamic defense.
- **High scalability**: Supports up to 96 vCPUs and 672 GiB RAM to meet demanding, memory-intensive workloads.
- **Regulated industry support**: Designed for organizations subject to stringent security and compliance requirements.

## Security Enhancements

- **SEV-SNP Technology**: Advanced memory protection mechanisms to defend against unauthorized access and side-channel attacks.
- **Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)**: In Windows (preview), enables secure processing of cryptographic keys, isolating them from the Guest OS and applications.
- **Integrated compliance and threat protection**: Assists in achieving and maintaining compliance standards while mitigating persistent security threats.

## Performance Improvements

- Benchmarks show up to **25% performance improvement** over previous confidential VM generations.
- Suitable for processing large confidential datasets, running joint analyses, medical research, and Confidential AI workloads.

## Kubernetes and OS Support

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Integration**: Direct support for DCasv6 and ECasv6 families to deploy and manage confidential clusters with built-in CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and scalability.
- **Operating System Support**: Azure Linux 3.0 (hardened and resource efficient) and Ubuntu 24.04 (preview) are supported for these VMs, enabling efficient orchestration and security.

## Usage and Documentation

- To get started, create confidential VMs via the [Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/quick-create-confidential-vm-portal) or use ARM templates.
