# Fix Broken Migrations with AI Debugging in VS Code Using GitHub Copilot

Data-driven applications often face challenges with evolving schemas, particularly when broken migrations disrupt development or production environments. MuhammadSamiullah shares practical steps to bring AI-powered assistance into your workflow, focusing on how GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code can fix migration issues with simple prompts, aided by the GibsonAI CLI.

## Key Takeaways

- Use **GitHub Copilot** in VS Code to describe migration errors and receive natural language-based code fixes
- Easily catch schema issues like missing or mismatched foreign keys before they block your workflow
- Validate and deploy migration fixes using the **GibsonAI CLI**

## The Migration Fixing Workflow

1. **Setup Requirements**
    - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and sign up for [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
    - Install and log in to [GibsonAI CLI](https://docs.gibsonai.com/reference/cli-quickstart)

2. **Identify a Common Error**
    - Example:

        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE users (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, email TEXT UNIQUE
        );
        CREATE TABLE posts (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, user_id UUID REFERENCES user(id)
        );
        ```

    - The mistake: `posts.user_id` references `user(id)` instead of `users(id)`

3. **Use Copilot to Debug**
    - Open **Copilot Chat** in VS Code
    - Ask: “My migration fails because posts.user_id references a missing user table. Can you fix the foreign key?”
    - Copilot analyzes the context and suggests the fix:

        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE posts (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)
        );
        ```

    - Copilot explains what changed, enhancing your understanding

4. **Validate and Deploy with GibsonAI**
    - Run `gibson validate` to check schema consistency
    - Deploy with `gibson deploy` when ready
    - GibsonAI assists with error-free migration application

## Why AI-Powered Migration Debugging Works

- Reduces manual searching and error-prone fixes
- Provides real-time learning while debugging
- Centralizes workflow in VS Code
- Cuts down time spent on fixing and redeploying migrations
