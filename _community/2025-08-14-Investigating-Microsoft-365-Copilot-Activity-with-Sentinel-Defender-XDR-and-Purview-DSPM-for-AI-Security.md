# Investigating Microsoft 365 Copilot Activity with Sentinel, Defender XDR, and Purview DSPM for AI Security

**Author:** Safeena Begum Lepakshi

As organizations adopt AI-powered tools such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, ChatGPT, and other generative assistants, ensuring data security becomes critical. AI tools process sensitive enterprise data, making robust monitoring and compliance essential.

## Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI

- DSPM for AI is a Microsoft Purview capability that helps organizations discover, secure, and enforce compliance controls on AI usage.
- It provides personalized recommendations and policy enforcement to mitigate oversharing risks and unauthorized data access in AI interactions.
- Key questions addressed by DSPM:
  - Where is sensitive data stored? Who can access it?
  - Are we protecting data from oversharing or unauthorized access by AI tools?
  - How to maintain compliance and governance for data accessed via AI?

## Operationalizing DSPM with Sentinel & Defender XDR

Security teams can operationalize DSPM for AI through Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR. The process involves capturing telemetry from Copilot interactions, building investigations, and responding to security incidents.

### 1. Ingesting Copilot Activity: CloudAppEvents Table

- **CloudAppEvents** is an advanced hunting table populated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
- To use this feature, organizations must enable Microsoft 365 activities within Defender XDR.
- Follow [detailed deployment steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-cloudappevents-table) to ensure CloudAppEvents is properly populated.
- The table contains enriched logs from all SaaS apps connected via Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

### 2. Activity Explorer in DSPM for AI

- The Activity Explorer hub in Purview DSPM for AI surfaces granular telemetry about every AI interaction, including:
  - Prompts and responses (if permissions/policies allow)
  - User identities
  - Sensitivity information types (SITs)
  - Application and agent details
- Provides visibility for risk assessment and compliance.

### 3. Unified Audit and Data Flow

- All AI interactions (from Copilot, Fabric, third-party GenAI apps, etc.) generate events in **Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log**.
- These are ingested into the **CloudAppEvents** table within Defender XDR if configured.
- The same CloudAppEvents are exposed in Microsoft Sentinel, allowing:
  - Threat hunting
  - Incident investigation
  - Compliance correlation
- No additional connectors are required.

## Practical Use Cases

- **Advanced Hunting:** Use KQL to query for AI interactions by sensitivity labels, app types, or user risk.
- **Incident Investigation:** Correlate AI activity with Office 365 alerts.
- **Compliance Audits:** Track activity for audit trails.
- **Custom Dashboards:** Visualize AI usage with Power BI or Sentinel dashboards.

### Example KQL Query

```kql
CloudAppEvents
| where Application in ("Microsoft 365", "Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat")
| where ActivityType == "Interactwithcopilot"
```

## Known Gaps and Recommendations

- **CloudAppEvents** provides metadata (timestamp, user, app/agent names, action type) but does not include prompt/response contents or DSPM enrichment (SITs, policy hits).
- For detailed investigations, pivot to **Purview DSPM Activity Explorer** to inspect full AI interactions with sensitivity context.
