# Overload to Optimal: Tuning Microsoft Fabric Capacity

**Co-Authored by Daya Ram, Sr. Cloud Solutions Architect**

Optimizing Microsoft Fabric is critical for balancing performance with cost efficiency. This guide explores how to diagnose capacity hotspots using Fabric's built-in observability tools, tune clusters and Spark settings, and apply data best practices for robust analytics workloads.

## Diagnosing Capacity Issues

### 1. Monitoring Hub: Analyze Workloads

- Browse Spark activity across applications (notebooks, Spark Job Definitions, pipelines).
- Identify long-running or anomalous runs by examining read/write bytes, idle time, and core allocation.
- [How-to Guide: Application Detail Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/spark-detail-monitoring)

### 2. Capacity Metrics App: Environment Utilization

- Review system-wide usage, spot overloads, and compare utilization by time window.
- Use ribbon charts and trend views to identify peaks or sustained high usage.
- Drill into specific time intervals to pinpoint compute-heavy operations.
- [Troubleshooting Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/capacity-planning-troubleshoot-consumption)

### 3. Spark UI: Deep Diagnostics

- Expose task skew, shuffle bottlenecks, memory pressure, and stage runtimes.
- Audit task durations, executor memory use (GC times, spills), and storage of datasets/cached tables.
- Adjust Spark settings to resolve skew or memory issues (e.g. `spark.ms.autotune.enabled`, `spark.task.cpus`, `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`).
- [Spark UI Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/web-ui.html)

## Remediation and Optimization

### A. Cluster & Workspace Settings

- **Runtime & Native Execution Engine (NEE):** Use Fabric Runtime 1.3 (Spark 3.5, Delta 3.2) and enable NEE at the environment level for faster Spark execution.
- **Starter vs. Custom Pools:** Use [Starter Pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/configure-starter-pools) for quick starts; switch to [Custom Pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/create-custom-spark-pools) for autoscaling and dynamic executors.
- **High Concurrency Session Sharing:** Reduce Spark session startup time and costs by sharing sessions across notebooks/pipelines. Useful for grouped workloads.
- **Autotune for Spark:** Enable per session/environment to auto-adjust shuffle partitions and broadcast join thresholds on-the-fly. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autotune?tabs=sparksql)

### B. Data-Level Best Practices

- **Intelligent Cache:** Enabled by default, keeps frequently read files close for faster Delta/Parquet/CSV reads.
- **OPTIMIZE & Z-Order:** Regularly run OPTIMIZE statements to restructure file layouts for performance; use Z-Order for better scan efficiency.
- **V-Order:** Turn on for read-heavy workloads to accelerate queries. (Disabled by default.)
- **VACUUM:** Remove unreferenced/stale files to control storage costs and manage time travel. Default retention: 7 days.

## Collaboration and Next Steps

- Review [capacity sizing guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/enterprise/plan-capacity) before adjustments.
- Coordinate with data engineering teams to develop an optimization playbook: focus on cluster runtime/concurrency as well as data file compaction and maintenance.
- Triage workloads: Use Monitor Hub → Capacity Metrics → Spark UI to map high-impact jobs and identify sources of throttling.
- Schedule maintenance: run OPTIMIZE (full/selective) off-peak, enable Auto Compaction for streaming/micro-batch, and VACUUM with agreed retention.
- Add regular [code review sessions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/spark-best-practices-basics#udf-best-practices) to uphold performance best practices.
- Adjust pool/concurrency, refactor queries, and repeat diagnostic cycles to verify improvements.
