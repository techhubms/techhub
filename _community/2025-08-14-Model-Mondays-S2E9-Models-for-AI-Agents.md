Sharda_Kaur presents a detailed recap of Model Mondays S2E9, highlighting the rollout of GPT-5 and GPT-OSS in Azure AI Foundry, agent workflow features in Azure AI Agent Service, and a customer case study on agentic AI in practice.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Model Mondays S2E9: Models for AI Agents

**Author:** Sharda_Kaur

## Welcome to Episode 9

In this episode, we explored the forefront of agentic AI with a focus on Azure AI Foundry, model and tool updates, and practical implementation insights.

---

## 1. Weekly Highlights

- **GPT-5 and GPT-OSS Models Launch:**
  - Azure AI Foundry now supports the latest GPT-5 models (including Mini and Nano variants) and open-weight GPT-OSS (120B, 20B). These models bring enhanced reasoning, fast agentic tasks, and broader deployment options via the Model Router.
- **New Vision Models (Flux 1 Context Pro, Flux 1.1 Pro):**
  - Image generation, editing, and style transfer now possible in Azure AI Foundry's Image Playground, thanks to new releases from Black Forest Labs.
- **Browser Automation Tool (Preview):**
  - Natural language-powered web automation is available for agents, streamlining UI tasks through API or SDK.
- **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode & Playwright MCP:**
  - Copilot now integrates with Playwright MCP Server to enable automatic UI bug detection and remediation with AI.
- **Discord Community:**
  - The Azure AI developer community is active on Discord, providing feedback channels and peer support.

## 2. Spotlight On: Azure AI Agent Service & Agent Catalog

- **Azure AI Agent Service:**
  - Managed platform for creating, deploying, and scaling agent-based AI solutions.
  - Enables modular, reusable, multi-agent workflows with built-in authentication and Azure integrations.
- **Agent Catalog:**
  - Repository of open-source agent templates and workflow samples including orchestrators and specialized agents for tasks (support, research, etc.).
- **Demos Covered:**
  - Orchestrating connected sub-agents.
  - Linking hierarchical agents for complex workflows (e.g., support handling with escalation).
  - Visual, no-code workflow design and Azure Logic Apps integration for connecting with 1400+ external apps/services.

## 3. Customer Story: Atomic Work

- **Problem:**
  - Traditional IT service management is slow and fragmented.
- **Solution:**
  - “Atom”: A universal, multimodal agent spanning Teams, browser, etc., answering enterprise queries and automating workflows.
  - Regular ingestion of documentation/context ensures relevant answers; built on Azure for robust security.
  - Demos included agent-led password resets, VPN troubleshooting, and GitHub access—sometimes with UI walkthroughs for users.

## 4. Key Takeaways

1. **Agentic AI is production-ready:** Azure AI Agent Service and Agent Catalog simplify deployment of scalable agent workflows.
2. **No-code, modular design:** Workflow Designer makes building agent graphs and triggers accessible to all developers.
3. **Open-source and extensible:** Agent Catalog is welcoming to community contributions and practical innovation.
4. **Measurable real-world impact:** Enterprises like Atomic Work show how agentic AI boosts IT and support efficiency.
5. **Active support channels:** Discord and the Azure AI forum connect you with experts and peers.

## Sharda's Tips: How I Wrote This Blog

“I use simple language, real examples, and Copilot-driven organization to share what I learned. My goal: show that agentic AI and Azure are accessible to all backgrounds. The prompt I used for Copilot:"

```
Generate a technical blog post for Model Mondays S2E9 based on the transcript and episode details. Focus on Azure AI Agent Service, Agent Catalog, and real-world demos. Explain the concepts for students, add a section on practical applications, and share tips for writing technical blogs. Make it clear, engaging, and useful for developers and students.
```
