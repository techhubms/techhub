Dazzling_Touch_9699 seeks advice on efficiently resolving over 100 merge conflicts by keeping incoming branch changes using Visual Studio.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

The community post by Dazzling_Touch_9699 addresses the challenge of merging branches when over 100 files have conflicts on the same lines. The author specifically wants to keep the *incoming* branch's changes and discard the current branch’s version, streamlining a tedious manual process.

## Problem Statement

During a code merge using Visual Studio, the author encounters a large number of merge conflicts (100+ files), all requiring the same resolution—accepting the incoming branch’s changes. Manually resolving each conflict one by one is impractical and time-consuming.

## Solution Sought

The author asks if there is a way to:

- Automatically resolve all conflicts by keeping the incoming branch’s version for every file.
- Achieve this through a single command or automated approach, ideally within Visual Studio, but is also open to alternative solutions.

## Common Approaches in Git

Though not detailed in the post, typical solutions in the Git ecosystem include:

- Using the git command-line:
  - `git merge --strategy-option theirs` (the `theirs` option, but only works with certain strategies)
  - For each conflicted file: `git checkout --theirs <file>`
  - To accept theirs for all conflicted files: `git checkout --theirs .`
  - Then complete the merge: `git add .` followed by a `git commit`
- Visual Studio typically requires manual intervention in merge conflicts, but plugins or external scripts can simplify the process.

## Key Takeaways

- This scenario is common in DevOps and source control workflows, especially with large codebases.
- Automating conflict resolution saves time and reduces human error when the desired outcome is consistent across all files.

## Next Steps

- Explore possible Visual Studio extensions or third-party tools to automate this within the IDE.
- Consider using git command-line tools for bulk conflict resolution, then returning to Visual Studio for review and commit.
- Always review the final merged state before committing to avoid unintentional data loss.
