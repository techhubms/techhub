# Securing AI Workloads with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Purview, and Sentinel in Azure Landing Zones

AI workloads are rapidly growing in enterprises, bringing sensitive data, expensive GPU compute, and valuable intellectual property. Securing these complex environments demands a layered and repeatable approach. Azure Landing Zones offer a scalable baseline that, when combined with Microsoft’s native security services, form a robust foundation for running AI at scale and with confidence.

## Why AI Landing Zones Matter

An AI Landing Zone is an opinionated Azure environment that bakes in governance, security, identity, networking, and operations from the start. Extending standard Landing Zones for AI means:

- Dedicated subscriptions by team or project
- Centralized shared services (network, identity, logging)
- Guardrails via Azure Policy and Blueprints
- End-to-end security integration using Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, and Key Vault

This ensures that multiple AI teams can adopt a consistent governance model and that risks are proactively managed.

## Key Security Threats for AI Workloads

AI workloads on Azure face several specific risks:

- Model theft and exfiltration of weights or checkpoints
- Exposure of sensitive training or inference data
- Abuse of inference endpoints (e.g., prompt injection, adversarial inputs)
- Supply-chain compromise from untrusted models/packages
- Privilege escalation through compromised compute or pipelines

Mapping these risks to Landing Zone design enables systematic coverage using Azure security services.

## Mapping Azure Security Services for AI

**Design Areas & Services:**

- **Identity & Access:** Azure AD, PIM, Managed Identities (enforcement of least privilege)
- **Governance:** Azure Policy, Blueprints (restricting exposure, enforcing compliance)
- **Compute Isolation:** Boundaries using Subscriptions, NSGs, Firewalls
- **Data Protection:** Key Vault, HSM, Confidential Computing
- **Threat Detection:** Defender for Cloud, Sentinel (SIEM/SOAR)
- **Supply Chain:** Azure Container Registry (ACR) scanning, GitHub SCA
- **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor, Log Analytics

## Reference Security Architecture

Each core AI resource is mapped to relevant security and governance services. For example:

- **Azure ML Workspace:** Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, Purview
- **Azure AI Search and Services (OpenAI):** Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, Purview
- **AKS/Container Apps:** Defender for Containers, Sentinel
- **Data Stores (Cosmos DB, Azure SQL):** Defender, Sentinel, Purview

## Practical Policy & Automation

- Enforce private endpoints for AI workspaces
- Enable disk encryption for GPU VMs
- Restrict public IP assignments on inference endpoints
- Automate threat detection and incident response
- Use ARM and Terraform templates to bootstrap controls

## Microsoft Defender for Cloud’s Role

Defender for Cloud acts as a combined Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP):

1. **Security Posture:** Continually monitors subscriptions and workloads for compliance and misconfigurations
2. **Threat Protection:** Protects AI resources (Azure ML, AKS, Storage) with tailored recommendations
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Maps workloads to ISO, SOC, HIPAA, and more
4. **Telemetry Integration:** Routes AI pipeline telemetry to Sentinel

## Microsoft Purview’s Role

Purview supplies data governance and compliance:

- Auto-scans and catalogs datasets used in ML training & inference
- Applies classification and sensitivity labels (PII, PHI, etc.)
- Integrates with RBAC and Purview’s own access policies
- Reports on compliance posture and produces audit trails for ML processes

## Microsoft Sentinel’s Role

Sentinel delivers centralized monitoring and active threat detection:

- Correlates logs from ML, AI services, databases, storage, and compute
- Detects suspicious activity (e.g., data exfiltration, prompt injection)
- Automates incident response via SOAR (e.g., quarantine, disable keys)
- Tracks compliance and provides AI-specific security dashboards

## Building a Trusted AI Platform: Defender + Purview + Sentinel

By integrating Defender for Cloud, Purview, and Sentinel in your Landing Zone:

- Infrastructure, data, and operations are consistently secured
- Sensitive AI assets are labeled, governed, and monitored
- Security teams have the visibility, automation, and controls needed for rapid response

## Implementation Checklist

1. **Enable Defender for Cloud** on all AI subscriptions and enforce baseline policies
2. **Onboard data sources** to Purview (run scans and apply labels)
3. **Integrate policies into AI pipelines**, requiring classification before training
4. **Establish access governance** and automate compliance dashboards
5. **Enable monitoring** across the entire stack using Sentinel
