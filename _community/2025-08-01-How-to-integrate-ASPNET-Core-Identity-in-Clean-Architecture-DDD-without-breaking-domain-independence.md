Successful_Cycle_465 asks about integrating ASP.NET Core Identity into a Clean Architecture (DDD) app while keeping the domain layer independent, and requests best practices and examples.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Article Summary

The author presents a common architectural dilemma when implementing user management in ASP.NET Core applications using Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

### The Core Challenge

- **Domain Independence:** The goal is to prevent domain entities from being directly dependent on infrastructure-specific classes such as `IdentityUser` from ASP.NET Core Identity.
- **Feature Utilization:** Inheriting from `IdentityUser` provides access to out-of-the-box features like authentication and roles, but ties the domain to infrastructure concerns.

### The Question

How can one integrate ASP.NET Core Identity into a Clean Architecture project using DDD, enabling user management features, without breaching the domain independence principle?

### Key Discussion Points

- **Inheritance Dilemma:** Inheriting from `IdentityUser` in the domain entity (`User`) introduces unwanted coupling to infrastructure, violating clean separation.
- **Not Inheriting:** Forfeits many of the convenient features that Identity provides (authentication, authorization, role management).

### Desired Solution

- Maintain **domain-purity** (domain entities should be free of framework and infrastructure dependencies).
- Leverage Identity's powerful capabilities **without polluting the domain model**.

### Request for Guidance

The author seeks:

- Best practices for decoupling Identity from the domain layer.
- Examples or patterns others have used successfully.

### Typical Solutions (industry best practices)

- **Map IdentityUser to Domain User:** Use separate entities for domain (`User` in the domain layer) and infrastructure (`IdentityUser`), and handle mapping between them at the application/infrastructure boundary.
- **Use Interfaces or Adapters:** Define domain interfaces for user-related operations and implement them in the infrastructure layer using Identity features.

## Conclusion

This discussion is valuable for .NET developers architecting enterprise-grade systems who wish to balance leveraging framework features with maintaining a rigorously clean domain model.
