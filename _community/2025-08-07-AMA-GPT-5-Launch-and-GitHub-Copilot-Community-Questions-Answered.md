# AMA: GPT-5 Launch and GitHub Copilot – Community Questions Answered

Hosted by Burke Holland and fellow Microsoft product managers and engineers, this AMA invites developers to engage with the latest advancements in AI-powered coding via GitHub Copilot. With GPT-5 announced as publicly previewed for GitHub Copilot, the community is encouraged to discuss real-life usage, technical differences between model variants, pricing concerns, agent mode, and ongoing VS Code development.

## Key Topics Covered

- **VS Code updates:** A new release brings fresh features and improvements for developers building with Microsoft tools.
- **GitHub Copilot & GPT-5 integration:** GPT-5 is now available within GitHub Copilot, raising questions about pricing, usage, and technical capabilities compared to earlier models like Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1.
- **Agent mode and Coding agents:** Users exchange experiences on performance in Agent mode and discuss how new models understand codebases differently.
- **Model pricing and request consumption:** Technical inquiries explore why certain models consume different premium requests despite their API pricing, and requests are made to make GPT-5 the default model for Copilot users.
- **Future model roadmap:** The Microsoft/VS Code engineering team shares thoughts (including “Beast Mode”), whether GPT-5 will be the thinking or non-thinking model, and plans for auto completions, model upgrades, and defaults.
- **MCP and Copilot product strategy:** Insights into Copilot management, product decisions, and technical leadership are provided by team members from various parts of the Copilot and VS Code engineering org.

## Participating Microsoft Team Members

- Pierce Boggan (PM Lead)
- Daniel Imms (Engineer — Terminal)
- Isidor Nikolic (PM Extensions/Marketplace)
- Tyler Leonhardt (Engineer — Auth)
- Harald Kirschner (PM MCP)
- Brigit Murtaugh (PM, Next Edit Suggestions)
- Conner Peet (Engineer, MCP)
- Burke Holland (DevRel, Copilot & "Beast Mode")

## How the AMA Works

1. Post your questions in the thread.
2. Upvote topics you want prioritized.
3. The team answers as many technical, product, and community questions as possible.

## Community Technical Inquiries (Sample)

- Will GPT-5 become the default/base model, or remain a premium option?
- How does GPT-5 compare functionally (in agent mode) to Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1?
- Why do some models use more premium quota even if API costs differ?
- What are the plans for further automations, coding assistant improvements, and model selection in Copilot?
