# Microsoft Azure at KubeCon North America 2025: AI and Cloud Native Insights

By Cory Skimming

KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America returns to Atlanta, GA, November 10-13, 2025, and Microsoft Azure is showing up with a packed agenda for developers, operators, and architects eager to deepen their cloud-native and AI expertise.

## Azure Day with Kubernetes – November 10

Join the Microsoft team before the main event for **Azure Day with Kubernetes**: a full day of technical learning, deep-dives, hands-on labs, and live discussions. Attendees will explore building cloud-native and AI applications using Kubernetes on Azure, connect with Microsoft engineers, and get practical experience with hands-on labs and whiteboarding sessions.

- Topics include Kubernetes operations, best practices, and AI app building
- Chance to discuss real-world scenarios with Azure Kubernetes experts
- [Register now](https://aka.ms/AzureKubernetesDay) – spots are limited!

## Booth #500: Connect with Microsoft Experts

Visit Booth #500 for:

- Live demos covering topics like AKS Automatic, agentic troubleshooting, Azure Verified Modules, networking, hybrid/cloud deployments, and storage
- Hands-on demos of AI-driven operations and cloud-native troubleshooting tools
- Open-source project showcases
- Interactive Kubernetes Trivia Show (during KubeCrawl)
- Networking with product teams and fellow practitioners

## Featured Microsoft Sessions and Demos

**Keynotes:**

- **Scaling Smarter: Simplifying Multicluster AI with KAITO and KubeFleet** ([details](https://sched.co/27dCv), Jorge Palma)
  - Explore the complexities and benefits of AI inferencing across multicluster Kubernetes environments using KAITO (for declarative AI inference workflows) and KubeFleet (for efficient workload distribution). Discover strategies for model versioning, performance telemetry, and consistent cluster performance.

- **Cloud Native Back to the Future: The Road Ahead** ([details](https://sched.co/27dEs), Jeremy Rickard, Alex Chircop)
  - The CNCF’s evolution—addressing security, sustainability, and the rise of AI workloads. Discussion includes the future of security hygiene, project maturity, and cloud-native support for intelligent systems.

**Featured Demo:**

- **HolmesGPT: Agentic K8s Troubleshooting in Your Terminal** ([details](https://sched.co/2A7EB), Pavneet Singh Ahluwalia, Arik Alon)
  - See how HolmesGPT and the Model Context Protocol enable natural-language Kubernetes troubleshooting in the CLI, offering AI-powered, human-in-the-loop diagnostics and remediation, compatible with in-cluster, local, or cloud LLM providers.

## Session Highlights with Microsoft Speakers

- **No Kubectl, No Problem: The Future With Conversational Kubernetes**
- **Smarter Together: Orchestrating Multi-Agent AI Systems With A2A and MCP on Container**
- **10 Years of Cilium: Connecting, Securing, and Simplifying the Cloud Native Stack**
- **Strengthening Supply Chain for Kubernetes: Cross-Cloud SLSA Attestation Verification**
- **OpenTelemetry: Unpacking 2025, Charting 2026**
- **Rage Against the Machine: Fighting AI Complexity with Kubernetes Simplicity**
- **Strengthening Kubernetes Trust: SIG Auth's Latest Security Enhancements**
- **AI Models Are Huge, but Your GPUs Aren’t: Mastering Multi-Mode Distributed Inference on Kubernetes**
- **Navigating the Rapid Evolution of Large Model Inference: Where Does Kubernetes Fit?**

...and many more, including deep dives into GitHub Actions, observability, secure infrastructure as code, policy enforcement, open-source contributions, and agentic AI in production.

## Microsoft’s Focus at KubeCon 2025
