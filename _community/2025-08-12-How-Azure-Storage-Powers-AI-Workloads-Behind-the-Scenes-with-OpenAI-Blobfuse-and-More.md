# How Azure Storage Powers AI Workloads: Behind the Scenes with OpenAI, Blobfuse & More

In this episode of [E2E: 10-minute Drill](https://aka.ms/E2E-10min-Drill), Pierre Roman chats with Vamshi from the Azure Storage team to discuss how Azure Blob Storage supports the growing demands of AI, including foundation models like ChatGPT and DALL·E.

## Key Highlights

- **Azure Blob Storage** is critical for storing and serving large datasets needed for AI and machine learning, from training data to user content in AI applications.
- The collaboration between Microsoft and OpenAI has resulted in technological advances like **Azure Scaled Accounts** and **Blobfuse2** (a Linux FUSE adapter for Azure Blob Storage), which are available to Azure customers.
- Enterprises can now securely integrate their data into Azure AI services, benefiting from advanced access controls (RBAC), performance at exabyte scale, and improved compliance.
- Microsoft’s tools allow organizations to train their own large language models (LLMs), fine-tune proprietary models, and manage robust AI data pipelines.

## Useful Resources

- **Azure Blob Storage Overview:** [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/)
- **Blobfuse2 - Linux FUSE Adapter:** [Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/blobfuse2-introduction)
- **Azure OpenAI Service:** [Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview)
- **Azure Role-Based Access Control:** [RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)

## Why It Matters

As AI continues to become central to enterprise workloads, understanding reliable data storage, secure access, and scalable infrastructure is increasingly important. Microsoft enables both developers and enterprises to build modern, intelligent apps using the same technologies that support OpenAI’s renowned models.
