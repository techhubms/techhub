# Announcing the August Preview Model for PII Redaction in Azure AI Language

Azure AI Language has released a new preview model for its PII (Personally Identifiable Information) redaction service. This release—version *2025-08-01-preview*—broadens the service's capabilities to address real-world demands for international use, regulatory coverage, and enhanced precision in sensitive data processing.

## What's New

- **Expanded Language Support for DateOfBirth Entities:**
  - Previously supported in English only, the DateOfBirth entity now recognizes and redacts dates in all Tier 1 languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Dutch.
- **Additional Entity Types:**
  - *SortCode*: Financial codes used in the UK and Ireland for identifying banks and branches.
  - *LicensePlateNumber*: Detection of alphanumeric vehicle registration codes (with current limitations for plates containing only letters).
- **AI Quality Enhancements:**
  - Improved false positive/negative rates, especially for financial entities, leading to more reliable service performance.

## Benefits and Use Cases

These improvements meet customer feedback by broadening both the scenarios and the international reach of the PII Redaction service. This is key for sectors such as finance and criminal justice, as well as any organization processing sensitive data across multiple languages and regulatory environments.
