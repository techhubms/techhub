## Implementation SMTP using MailKit in ASP .NET Core MVC

**Author:** soumyadipmajumder03  
**Date:** April 25, 2025

### Scenario

The author is developing a web application using ASP.NET Core MVC where there is a requirement to enable email notifications. Specifically, after a user submits a form (collecting fields such as name, email, title, and message), the system needs to automatically send the entered details as an email to the site owner. The request mentions the use of MailKit, a popular email-sending library, and specifies version 4.11.0.

### Technical Requirements

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core MVC (latest version)
- **Email Library**: MailKit v4.11.0
- **Functionality**: Accept form submissions and trigger an email containing the submission details to a specified recipient (site owner).

### Problem Statement

The author seeks guidance or sample implementations for integrating SMTP email sending via MailKit with the specified versions. There is particular interest in the best practices for setting up and triggering emails in response to form submissions in modern ASP.NET Core MVC projects.

### Typical Implementation Steps (For Reference)

1. **Add MailKit to the project**: Install via NuGet `MailKit` package.
2. **Configure SMTP settings**: Store SMTP server credentials securely (e.g., in `appsettings.json`).
3. **Create an Email Service**: Implement a service to construct and send emails using MailKit.
4. **Integrate with Controller**: Upon form submission, invoke the email service to send the message.
5. **Error Handling**: Log failures and provide user-facing feedback as appropriate.

**Note:** The original post was a request for implementation details, not an instructional guide.
