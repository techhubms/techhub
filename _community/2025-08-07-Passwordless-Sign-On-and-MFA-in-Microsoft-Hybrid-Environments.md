# Passwordless Sign-On and MFA in Microsoft Hybrid Environments

A community member raises questions about Microsoft shifting away from passwords toward passwordless sign-on, specifically regarding:

- **Applicability in hybrid organizations** (with both on-premises and cloud resources)
- Uncertainty about the future of the Microsoft Authenticator app and alternatives for passkeys

**Key Discussion Points:**

- Passwordless authentication is feasible and encouraged by Microsoft, but hybrid scenarios raise challenges for seamless sign-on, particularly where local resources are involved.
- The conversation highlights 'Cloud Kerberos Trust' as a way to authenticate hybrid users against the cloud while retaining access to on-premises resources. This setup is referenced by the presence of a computer account called `AZUREADSSOACC` in Active Directory, indicating Azure AD SSO is configured.
- Clarification is provided on misinformation regarding the discontinuation of the Microsoft Authenticator app. Contributors express skepticism about the rumored retirement and emphasize that authentication options remain robust.

**Relevant Topics:**

- Microsoft's evolving authentication strategy (passwordless, passkeys)
- Hybrid identity and secure access across cloud/on-prem
- Kerberos Trust bridges between local AD and Azure
- Best practices for MFA in Microsoft ecosystems
