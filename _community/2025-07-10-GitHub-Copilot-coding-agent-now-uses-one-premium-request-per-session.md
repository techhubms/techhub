In a post by sharonlo_, changes to the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent's pricing are announced. Starting July 10th, sessions initiated through Copilot Coding Agent will consistently require one Copilot premium request, streamlining costs and enhancing predictability for users. This update addresses community feedback and distinguishes the Copilot Coding Agent from agent mode in IDEs, which already bills one premium request per user prompt.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary of GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Pricing Update

GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent, a feature that lets users assign coding tasks via GitHub issues, has adjusted its pricing structure as of July 10th. According to sharonlo_, each session with the Copilot Coding Agent will now consume exactly one Copilot premium request, regardless of the complexity or duration of the task.

### Key Points

- **Simplified Pricing:** The new model replaces previous structures with a straightforward requirement: one premium request per session.
- **User Feedback:** This change responds directly to user input, focusing on making usage costs more understandable and predictable for developers.
- **Clarification of Modes:** It's important to distinguish the Copilot Coding Agent from 'agent mode' in integrated development environments (IDEs). While the Coding Agent is activated through GitHub issues, agent mode in IDEs was already operating under a 1-request-per-prompt model.

### Impact for Developers

These changes aim to make planning and managing Copilot usage easier, allowing developers and teams to better anticipate their costs when utilizing the Copilot Coding Agent. For more details, users are directed to further resources provided by the GitHub team.

This streamlined pricing is expected to benefit both individual developers and teams by making the Copilot experience more transparent and efficient.
