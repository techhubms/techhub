# Oracle Database 19c Support on Exadata Exascale and Oracle Database@Azure – Plus UAE Regional Expansion

**Author:** SparshAgrawat

Organizations accelerating their cloud modernization now have expanded opportunities with Oracle Database@Azure. This article presents two major updates:

- **Support for Oracle Database 19c on Exadata Database Service with Exascale Infrastructure via Oracle Database@Azure.**
- **General availability of Oracle Database@Azure in UAE North (Dubai) and UAE Central (Abu Dhabi) regions.**

## Oracle Database 19c on Exadata Exascale for Oracle Database@Azure

Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure is designed for elastic database scaling, optimized performance, and cost efficiency on Oracle workloads. With this update, enterprises can:

- **Migrate Oracle Database 19c workloads to Azure** using Exascale infrastructure without mandating immediate upgrades.
- **Optimize costs and performance** by leveraging granular scaling and advanced infrastructure.
- **Modernize database environments** while retaining a clear upgrade path to newer Oracle releases in the future.
- **Integrate with Microsoft services** like Microsoft Fabric, Copilot Studio, Sentinel, and Azure AI Foundry—aiding organizations in pursuing AI-powered data workloads and advanced analytics on Azure.

## Regional Expansion: UAE North & UAE Central

Oracle Database@Azure is now generally available in two new UAE regions:

- **UAE North (Dubai)**
- **UAE Central (Abu Dhabi)**

This enables organizations in the Middle East to:

- Meet data residency and compliance requirements for regulated industries.
- Accelerate digital transformation initiatives through local access to Oracle Database services on Azure.
- Integrate mission-critical Oracle data with Azure services, fostering innovation in multicloud and hybrid cloud models.

## Global Reach

Oracle Database@Azure is now present in 25 regions and 40 Availability Zones worldwide—including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, the US, UK, and more. The service is scheduled to expand further by the end of 2025, adding coverage in regions like Spain Central, Switzerland North, and West Europe.

Deployment aligns with Microsoft's disaster recovery and cross-region replication best practices ([learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-paired)).

## Integration and Modernization Benefits

With expanded service coverage and updated support, organizations benefit from:

- Seamless migration and modernization of Oracle workloads.
- The ability to leverage cloud-native models for Oracle databases within Azure’s robust global infrastructure.
