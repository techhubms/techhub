Authored by LazyChief_117, this post highlights an integration testing issue in .NET 8 Web APIs, where configuration files intermittently fail to load after certain server updates.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Loading Configurations for Integration Tests

### Overview

LazyChief_117 describes encountering an inconsistent issue with .NET 8 Web API integration tests. After operating system (OS) patching on some server nodes, the tests fail to load the `appsettings.json` configuration file, while other nodes remain unaffected. The problem is linked to microservices developed in C# 10, and restarting the affected containers resolves the issue.

### Technical Details

- **Issue:**
  - Integration tests for a .NET 8 Web API intermittently fail to load the `appsettings.json` file.
  - This is only observed after OS patching on select server nodes.
  - The issue resolves upon container restart, suggesting a transient or system-level root cause.

- **Context:**
  - The microservice is implemented using C# version 10.
  - Configuration retrieval relies on the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration` interface:

    ```csharp
    Configuration.GetSection(APP_SETTING_KEY).Bind(AppSettings);
    ```

### Discussion Points

- The post invites speculation and troubleshooting suggestions from the community regarding possible causes of the configuration loading failure.
- Potential causes (not explicitly stated but typically relevant):
  - File-locking or resource contention post-OS update.
  - Environment variable issues or path reference differences after patching.
  - Container or process-level caching or permission issues that get reset when the container restarts.

### Community Engagement

- Readers are asked to contribute their insights and troubleshooting steps for resolving such configuration issues in .NET integration tests, especially after system-level changes like OS patching.
