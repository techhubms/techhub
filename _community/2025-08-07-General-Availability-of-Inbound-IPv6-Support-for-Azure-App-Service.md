# General Availability of Inbound IPv6 Support for Azure App Service

**Author:** jordanselig

Inbound IPv6 support is now generally available on public multi-tenant Azure App Service, after a period in public preview. This release covers all public Azure regions, Azure Government, and Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet, and is available for multi-tenant apps on all Basic, Standard, and Premium SKUs, Functions Consumption, Functions Elastic Premium, and Logic Apps Standard.

## Key Details

- **IP-SSL IPv6 bindings** are still not supported (other limitations from preview have been removed).
- IPv6 inbound requires:
  - An IPv6 address accepting incoming traffic
  - DNS record returning an IPv6 (AAAA) record
  - Clients capable of sending/receiving IPv6 traffic (many networks only support IPv4)
- All App Service deployment units now have IPv6 addresses assigned, enabling inbound traffic via both IPv4 and IPv6.
- By default, DNS for `*.azurewebsites.net` only returns the IPv4 address for backward compatibility.
- **IPMode property:** Site property can be set to `IPv6` or `IPv4AndIPv6`:
  - `IPv6`: DNS returns only IPv6; clients must support IPv6
  - `IPv4AndIPv6`: DNS returns both; enables dual-stack connectivity
- For custom domains, manage DNS records similarly (AAAA for IPv6, CNAME to default hostname as needed).
- **Important:** IPMode affects only DNS resolution, not endpoint accessibility (all App Service sites accept traffic on both protocols regardless of IPMode setting).

## How to Test

Use a client/system that supports IPv6 networking. Example command:

```sh
curl -6 https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net
```

## Documentation

For configuration and implementation details, see the [App Service inbound IPv6 documentation](https://aka.ms/app-service-inbound-ipv6).

## Future Roadmap

1. *Coming soon*: Public preview of IPv6 non-vnet outbound support for Linux (multi-tenant); Windows support is already in preview ([official blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/appsonazureblog/announcing-app-service-outbound-ipv6-support-in-public-preview/4423368))
2. *Backlog*: IPv6 vnet outbound support (multi-tenant & ASE v3)
3. *Backlog*: IPv6 vnet inbound support (ASE v3, internal & external)

Version 2.0 (Updated Aug 07, 2025)
