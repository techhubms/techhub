# Defining the Raw Data Vault with Artificial Intelligence: Automating Data Warehouse Modeling

**Article by Michael Olschimke, technical review by Naveed Hussain and Ian Clarke**

## Introduction

Data Vault is a foundational concept for building robust and agile data solutions. Traditionally, defining Raw Data Vault models required intense manual analysis and development from data engineers. This article showcases how modern artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, particularly with platforms like Flow.BI, are transforming this process—resulting in higher efficiency, accuracy, and scalability for enterprise-scale data warehousing.

## The Challenge of Manual Data Vault Modeling

- **Manual Modeling:** Historically, engineers mapped source data, designed the Raw Data Vault using modeling tools like Microsoft Visio, and developed DDL/ELT scripts by hand.
- **Patterns and Templates:** Repeated modeling patterns led engineers to develop (often complex) automation scripts, but these are limited in scalability and still reliant on expert intervention.
- **Adoption of Automation Tools:** Commercial tools (e.g., Vaultspeed) automate much of the code generation via metadata repositories, allowing metadata-driven approaches for creating the Raw Data Vault and subsequent layers.

## AI-Driven Automation: The Next Step

- **Role of Artificial Intelligence:** AI enables the generation and configuration of Data Vault models by analyzing data sources, identifying patterns, and suggesting or even finalizing modeling decisions.
- **Efficiency Gains:** By shifting from manual engineering to AI-driven metadata generation, organizations dramatically increase the pace and consistency of data warehouse modeling, even as the complexity of data sources (tables, APIs, semi-structured data) grows rapidly.

## The Flow.BI Platform

- **What Flow.BI Does:** Flow.BI connects to data sources—including Microsoft SQL Server, Synapse, and Fabric—and applies AI to define Raw Data Vault models.
- **Automation Process:** Users attach their data sources, and Flow.BI's AI analyzes structure and metadata to produce a fully integrated and consistent enterprise data vault model.
- **Technology Integrations:** The platform is designed to integrate with modern Microsoft platforms (e.g., Fabric, Synapse, Azure Data Lake Storage) and works with a variety of cloud- and on-premises data sources via JDBC.

## Features and Capabilities

- **Strict Data-Driven Design:** Emulates human modeling behavior, requiring only basic metadata to propose models.
- **User Influence:** Data modelers can both guide and override AI decisions through a streamlined UI, blending automation with domain expertise.
- **Multi-tenant Modeling Support:** Flow.BI handles enterprise-wide scenarios such as multi-tenant data platforms and data mesh architectures.
- **Security and Privacy:** Supports local data storage and processing, with the option to use Azure Data Lake Storage for data, ensuring sensitive information remains on-premises. Fine-grained metadata security and AI-assisted privacy classification are included features.
- **Multilingual Metadata Support:** AI-driven translation options allow automatic conversion of table and column names for global deployments.
- **Physical Model Generation:** Flow.BI delivers logical Raw Data Vault definitions which ISV partners or automation tools further translate into DDL/ELT scripts tailored for platforms like Microsoft Fabric.
- **Extensibility:** The expert system underlying Flow.BI can support other modeling approaches (e.g., Inmon, Kimball, JSON collections, key-value stores), making it suitable for diverse data-driven architectures.

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

- **Data Sovereignty:** Organizations can opt for full local control—no raw data leaves client infrastructure; only essential metadata (secured and partitioned per tenant) is shared if required.
- **Privacy Classification:** Users can classify column-level data sensitivity, with upcoming releases leveraging AI to automate privacy-related tagging.

## Real-World Impact

With the accelerating growth in both the volume and complexity of enterprise datasets, AI-powered automation tools like Flow.BI allow organizations to scale their data warehousing initiatives without being limited by the number of skilled data modelers available in the workforce.

## Conclusion

AI-driven platforms are fundamentally changing how enterprises approach data vault modeling. By leveraging automation that integrates with Microsoft Fabric, Azure services, and other modern data stacks, organizations can efficiently define, secure, and evolve large-scale analytical data platforms to meet modern business intelligence needs.
