junjieli explains how the AI Toolkit v0.18.3 for VS Code brings full support for GPT-5 and GPT OSS models, providing developers with powerful AI integration and deployment features across Azure and local environments.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GPT-5 Family of Models & GPT OSS Are Now Available in AI Toolkit for VS Code

**AI Toolkit v0.18.3** delivers a major milestone for developers working with AI in Visual Studio Code. This release brings:

- **Support for the GPT-5 family of models**
- **Integration of OpenAIâ€™s open-source GPT OSS models** via Azure AI Foundry and ONNX Runtime

Whether you're building cloud, edge, or local solutions, this update expands your options for performance, flexibility, and model variety.

## ðŸ§  GPT-5 Models: Integrated in AI Toolkit

You can now access the latest GPT-5 models directly from AI Toolkit, available through GitHub, Azure AI Foundry, or OpenAI APIs. Key models include:

- **gpt-5:** Advanced reasoning for analytics, LLM orchestration, and code generation.
- **gpt-5-mini:** Low-latency and cost-effective for real-time and resource-constrained use cases.
- **gpt-5-nano:** Speed-optimized for Q&A and workflow automation.
- **gpt-5-chat (preview):** Built for multi-turn conversations with persistent context, ready for agentic applications.

## ðŸ§¬ GPT OSS Models: Open-Source AI for Cloud and Local Use

For the first time, developers can deploy OpenAI's open-source GPT OSS models via:

- **Azure AI Foundry** for cloud-scale deployment
- **Windows AI Foundry paired with ONNX Runtime** for local GPU inference.

### Model Highlights

- **gpt-oss-120b:** Text-in/text-out, open-weight, supports chain-of-thought, response formatting, and adjustable reasoning levels. [Learn more](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/gpt-oss-120b)
- **gpt-oss-20b-cuda-gpu:** CUDA-optimized for local use with RTN quantization, suitable for Windows and edge deployments. [Learn more](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/gpt-oss-20b-cuda-gpu)

For details, see the [Microsoft blog post on GPT OSS in Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/openais-open%E2%80%91source-model-gpt%E2%80%91oss-on-azure-ai-foundry-and-windows-ai-foundry/).

## ðŸ§ª Accelerate Your Workflow: Explore, Compare, and Ship Faster

- **Model Catalog:** Compare GPT-5 variants with others to choose the best match for your workload.
- **View Code:** Instantly generate ready-to-run SDK code snippets in Python, JavaScript, and more for rapid prototyping and integration.

## ðŸ”— How to Get Started

Upgrade to **AI Toolkit v0.18.3** in VS Code to experiment with:

- Full GPT-5 family support (GitHub, Azure AI, OpenAI)
- Open-source GPT OSS models for both cloud and local use
- Playground tools for model comparison and automated code generation

AI Toolkit continues to help developers ship AI-enhanced solutions across platforms, whether closed-source or open-source, cloud or edge.
