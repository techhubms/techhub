# Extended Support for Azure Database for MySQL: What You Need to Know

**Author:** Elendil  
**Updated:** Aug 13, 2025  

Microsoft is introducing **Extended Support for Azure Database for MySQL** as a paid offering. This program is designed to help customers continue running workloads on MySQL versions like 5.7 and 8.0 in Azure, even after these versions reach their community end-of-life (EOL).

## Why Extended Support?

- Many customers have dependencies on MySQL 5.7 or 8.0 and cannot immediately upgrade to newer versions.
- Azure aims to provide extra time and flexibility while maintaining security, support, and reliability during the transition period.

## What's Included in Extended Support?

- **SLA-backed availability**: Enterprise-grade service level agreements continue to apply.
- **Security updates**: Ongoing critical security patches help protect workloads.
- **Technical support**: Azure engineers remain available for troubleshooting and operational issues.

### Seamless and Predictable Experience

- **Automatic enrollment**: Once a supported MySQL version hits its community EOL, Azure-managed instances enter Extended Support automatically—no action needed.
- **Grace period**: There's a one-month grace period after EOL before billing starts.
- **Pay-as-you-go pricing**: Billed per vCore per hour, with no upfront cost.
- **Exit on upgrade**: Billing for Extended Support stops as soon as a server is upgraded to a supported major version.

### Pricing & Availability

- Pricing details will be announced by Q3 2025 via the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/).

## Support Timeline

| MySQL Version | Azure Standard Support Ends | Extended Support Starts | Extended Support Ends |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| 5.7           | March 31, 2026             | April 1, 2026          | March 31, 2029       |
| 8.0           | May 31, 2026               | June 1, 2026           | March 31, 2029       |

All future Azure-hosted MySQL versions will follow this Extended Support model after their EOL. More details: [Version Support Policy | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-version-policy).

## Upgrade Paths for Customers

If you don't want Extended Support, upgrading is recommended. Two main upgrade options are available:

1. **In-place Upgrade on the Same Instance**
   - Supported on Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server.
   - Initiate upgrades from the Azure portal, CLI, or ARM templates.
   - Preserves server configurations and connection strings.
2. **Validate the Upgrade Before Production**
   - **Replica-Based Validation**: Create a read replica, upgrade, test, and promote when satisfied.
   - **PITR-Based Validation**: Use point-in-time restore to make a test server and validate before production rollout.

### Best Practices

- Always back up data before upgrades.
- Review MySQL release notes for breaking changes.
- Monitor applications after upgrade to catch issues early.
