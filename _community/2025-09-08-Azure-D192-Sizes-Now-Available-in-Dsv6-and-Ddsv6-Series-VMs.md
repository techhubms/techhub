# Azure D192 Sizes Now Available in Dsv6 and Ddsv6-Series VMs

*Authored by Sarah Zhou, Product Manager*

## Overview

Azure has added the D192 size to its Dsv6 and Ddsv6-series Virtual Machine families. These new VM sizes are powered by the 5th Generation Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8573C (Emerald Rapids) processor and are available in many Azure regions.

- **Dsv6-series:** Uses Azure managed disks only.
- **Ddsv6-series:** Offers local, temporary storage disks.

## Use Cases

The D192 VM sizes are designed for general-purpose and high-performance workloads, such as:

- Enterprise applications: SAP, SQL Server, in-memory analytics platforms, and large relational databases
- Web and application servers (moderate to heavy traffic)
- Batch processing tasks
- Developer and test environments
- Other CPU/memory intensive applications

## Key Features

- **192 vCPUs and 768 GiB RAM:** Meets demanding compute and memory requirements.
- **Azure Boost:** Up to 400K IOPS, 12 GB/s remote storage throughput, and up to 82 Gbps network bandwidth. More on [Azure Boost](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-boost/overview?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-machines%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json).
- **NVMe Interface:** Provides significant improvement in local storage IOPS (3x performance for low-latency access).
- **Intel® Total Memory Encryption (TME):** Hardware-level data protection for system memory.

## Specifications
