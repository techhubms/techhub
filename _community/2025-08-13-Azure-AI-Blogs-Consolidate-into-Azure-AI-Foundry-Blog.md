# Azure AI Blogs Consolidate into Azure AI Foundry Blog

**Author:** GalimahB ([profile](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/users/galimahb/2576822))

## Overview

To create a unified source for Azure AI content, several Microsoft Azure AI Tech Community blogs have been merged into a single destination: the [Azure AI Foundry Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry). This consolidation includes the former AI Platform Blog, Azure AI Services Blog, and Azure Machine Learning Blog.

## What's Changed

- **Multiple Azure AI blogs have merged** into the Azure AI Foundry Blog.
- **All previous posts** from the legacy AI blogs have been migrated to the new location.
- Visitors to old blog URLs will be automatically redirected to the new blog homepage to ensure a seamless transition.

## Seamless Access to Past Content

- Existing technical resources remain fully accessible.
- All bookmarks and saved links will automatically redirect to their new locations within the Azure AI Foundry Blog archive.

## Subscription Update Required

- **Important:** Previous email and RSS subscriptions have not been carried over.
- To keep receiving Azure AI content, [re-subscribe](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry) using the Follow button on the new blog's homepage.
- This one-time re-subscription ensures you won't miss future technical updates.

## Looking Ahead

The move provides a more streamlined, unified experience covering Azure AI services, platforms, and machine learning advances. The goal is to help the community more easily find in-depth technical news, tutorials, and solution guidance from Microsoft’s AI teams.

## Additional Resources

- [Azure Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/)
- [DevBlogs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/)
- Azure AI community discussions: [Discord](https://discord.gg/azureaifoundry) | [GitHub](https://github.com/resources/articles)
