# Enhance Your Data Protection Strategy with Azure Elastic SAN’s Newest Backup Options

Azure Elastic SAN is evolving as a scalable high-performance storage platform, and now, organizations can leverage fully managed backup solutions through Azure Backup and Commvault—both in public preview. These integrations simplify and automate backup management, delivering improved data protection, simplified restore processes, and advanced recovery features for Elastic SAN volumes.

## Azure Backup Release Highlights

- **Operational Tier Backup with Independent Lifecycle**: Each backup creates a Managed Disk Incremental Snapshot of an Elastic SAN volume. These snapshots are stored in locally redundant storage (LRS) and managed independently of the original volume, ensuring recoverability even if volumes are deleted.
- **Daily Restore Points**: Up to 450 restore points are supported on a daily schedule, providing strong short-term retention and reducing the risk of data loss.
- **Simplified Management**: Configuration and monitoring are integrated via the Azure Business Continuity Center. Azure Backup automatically manages backup scheduling and retention, minimizing administrative overhead.
- **Cost Considerations**: During preview, Azure Backup Protected Instance Fees are waived for Elastic SAN volumes, but standard charges for incremental snapshots apply.

## Commvault Release Highlights

- **Snapshot-Based Protection**: Commvault's IntelliSnap enables rapid, low-impact backups. Retention periods are configurable by day or count, with indefinitely long options available.
- **Flexible Recovery Options**: Full-VM and attach-disk restore are provided, including support for cross-region restores in which Elastic SAN volumes can be restored as managed disks.
- **Platform Compatibility**: Supports both Windows and Linux virtual machines. Discovering Elastic SAN volumes requires PowerShell (Windows) or Python 3 (Linux).
- **Deployment Considerations**: Currently, app-consistent restore points are not supported; attach-disk restores to VMs result in managed disks. Connection to VMs is via iSCSI.

## Use Case Comparison

- **Azure Backup** is ideal for native, single-volume Azure-centric scenarios, offering integrated management and up to 450 days of restore point retention.
- **Commvault** excels at large-scale VM scenarios, multiple volume management, and advanced backup needs, including indefinite retention and granular recovery controls.
