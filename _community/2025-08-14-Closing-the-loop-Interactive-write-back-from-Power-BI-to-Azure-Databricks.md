# Closing the loop: Interactive write-back from Power BI to Azure Databricks

*Collaborative post by Microsoft and Databricks, with contributions from Toussaint Webb (Product Manager, Databricks).*

## Introduction

The Azure Databricks connector for Power Platform is now generally available, enabling seamless integration between Power Apps, Power Automate, Copilot Studio, and Azure Databricks dataâ€”with robust governance and no data duplication required.

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-time Data Flow:** Organizations can read from and write to Azure Databricks data warehouses in real time from Power Platform tools.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Power BI users can initiate writebacks directly to Azure Databricks, enabling fast, data-driven actions.
- **End-to-End Integration:** No custom connectors or additional services/licenses required; the connector operates entirely within Power Platform environments.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Writebacks from Power BI to Azure Databricks

1. **Create a Connector in Power Apps**
     - Open Power Apps and follow [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/msft-power-platform) to link with Azure Databricks.
2. **Embed Power Apps Visual in Power BI**
     - In Power BI (desktop or online), insert a Power Apps visual (purple icon) into your report.
3. **Connect Data to Your App**
     - Use the Power BI visualization pane to provide data for the embedded Power App.
4. **Build or Select Power App**
     - Either create a new app directly from Power BI or select an existing app to embed and enable real-time updates to Azure Databricks.

With these steps, users can update and manage data in Azure Databricks directly from within Power BI, unlocking new workflows such as real-time inventory adjustments or performance monitoring.

## Workflow Scenarios

- **Warehouse Management:** Supervisors can flag operational issues in real time and update records on the spot.
- **Retail Inventory:** Store managers can review and instantly adjust inventory levels using the integrated platform.
