Outrageous_Permit154 introduces a GitHub Copilot Custom Chat Mode competition. This initiative invites the community to craft creative Custom Chat Modes using only official tools and included models.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

Author Outrageous_Permit154 calls on the GitHub Copilot community to join a friendly competition focused on designing the best Custom Chat Modes for GitHub Copilot. The idea was inspired by 'Beast Mode' from Burke Holland and aims to foster innovation and experimentation among Copilot users.

## Purpose and Format

- **Competition Objective:** Build and submit the most effective Custom Chat Mode for GitHub Copilot, with an emphasis on performance, output quality, and reliability.
- **Platform:** Likely to operate via a public GitHub repository for transparency and collaboration.
- **Participation:** Community members can fork the repo, add their modifications in a folder named after their Reddit handle, provide a README with details, and submit pull requests.

## Rules (Subject to Feedback)

1. Only use tools from the official VS Code MCP tool list; no custom MCP or third-party tools.
2. Work with included models only (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4.1`), pushing the capabilities of stock options.
3. Submissions will be scored on:
    - **Performance & Result Quality**
    - **Consistency** (reliability of outputs)

## Community Focus

- The event is intended to be research-oriented and fun, rather than purely competitive.
- Openness to suggestions on rules and format, encouraging a collaborative atmosphere.
- Discussion on whether to keep the initiative within Reddit or expand participation channels.

## Call to Action

- Anyone interested is encouraged to join and contribute ideas.
- The project is in the initial organizational phase, with hosts open to letting others drive the repository management if interested.

## Conclusion

This competition represents a community-driven way to expand the utility and creativity of GitHub Copilot Custom Chat Modes, focusing on collaborative learning and shared knowledge.
