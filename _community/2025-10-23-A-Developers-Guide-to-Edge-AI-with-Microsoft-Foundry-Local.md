# A Developer's Guide to Edge AI and Foundry Local

## Introduction

Are you encountering high costs and latency with cloud AI deployments? This guide explains how Edge AI with Microsoft's Foundry Local helps developers move large language models (LLMs) to users’ devices or on-prem infrastructure. By doing so, you’ll gain greater privacy, offline reliability, and fixed costs, all with familiar OpenAI API compatibility.

## Why Edge AI Is the Next Step for Developers

Cloud-based AI can introduce high operating costs, latency problems, and data privacy concerns. Edge AI deployment allows you to run models locally, resulting in:

- **Better privacy**: Data stays within your infrastructure.
- **Faster response times**: Sub-10ms local inference compared to 200-800ms cloud latency.
- **Predictable cost structure**: Invest in hardware, avoid pay-per-token API fees.
- **Offline operation and resilience**: AI works even without network access.

These benefits are vital for sectors like healthcare, finance, and anywhere real-time performance and compliance matter.

## What Is Microsoft Foundry Local?

Foundry Local enables local deployment of powerful language models via a unified platform with:

- **Multi-framework SDKs and native APIs** for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, and .NET
- **Enterprise-grade model catalog** (including `phi-3.5-mini`, `qwen2.5-0.5b`, and `gpt-oss-20b`)
- **Automatic hardware optimization**: Detects NVIDIA/AMD GPUs, Intel or Qualcomm NPUs, and optimizes model selection
- **ONNX Runtime acceleration**: Delivers maximum local inference speed and compatibility
- **OpenAI API compatibility**: Existing apps can swap endpoints, preserving code structure

## Practical Implementation Patterns

### Python Example (for Data Science and ML)

```python
import openai
from foundry_local import FoundryLocalManager

alias = "phi-3.5-mini"
manager = FoundryLocalManager(alias)

client = openai.OpenAI(base_url=manager.endpoint, api_key=manager.api_key)

def analyze_document(content: str):
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=manager.get_model_info(alias).id,
        messages=[
            { "role": "system", "content": "You are an expert document analyzer." },
            { "role": "user", "content": f"Analyze this document: {content}" }
        ],
        stream=True,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    result = ""
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            content_piece = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            result += content_piece
            yield content_piece
    return result
```

- Model management, memory, and hardware selection are handled automatically.
- The familiar OpenAI streaming API is used locally for real-time updates.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example (for Web Apps)

```javascript
import { OpenAI } from "openai";
import { FoundryLocalManager } from "foundry-local-sdk";

class LocalAIService {
  constructor() { this.foundryManager = null; this.openaiClient = null; this.isInitialized = false; }

  async initialize(modelAlias = "phi-3.5-mini") {
    this.foundryManager = new FoundryLocalManager();
    const modelInfo = await this.foundryManager.init(modelAlias);
    this.openaiClient = new OpenAI({ baseURL: this.foundryManager.endpoint, apiKey: this.foundryManager.apiKey });
    this.isInitialized = true;
    return modelInfo;
  }

  async generateCodeCompletion(codeContext, userPrompt) {
    if (!this.isInitialized) throw new Error("LocalAI service not initialized");
    const completion = await this.openaiClient.chat.completions.create({
      model: this.foundryManager.getModelInfo().id,
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a code completion assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: `Context: ${codeContext}\n\nComplete: ${userPrompt}` }
      ],
      max_tokens: 150,
      temperature: 0.2
    });
    return completion.choices[0].message.content;
  }
}
```

- Enables offline, instant response AI directly in web browsers or desktop clients.
- Protects user data by keeping all inference on-device.

## Enterprise Deployment and Metrics

Across languages and hardware stacks, Foundry Local provides:

- **Automatic hardware optimization for CUDA/NPUs/CPUs**
- **Resource management** for stable, concurrent inference
- **Production monitoring integration**

### Business Impact

- **Dramatic reduction in ongoing API costs** (e.g., $60,000+/year in savings for large apps)
- **Offline and resilience for critical systems**
- **Faster development cycles by removing rate limits and dependency on external APIs**

### Proven Use Cases

- Internal dev tools cut AI cost by 60-80% and boost productivity
- Industrial IoT improves uptime, eliminates reliance on cloud
- Financial analytics keep sensitive data truly private
