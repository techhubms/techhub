Their experience offers a useful perspective for developers considering alternatives to popular AI code assistants.<!--excerpt_end-->

## User's Experience Migrating from GitHub Copilot to Cursor

**UsualResult** recounts a journey from relying on GitHub Copilot to adopting Cursor, an alternative AI-powered code assistant. In an earlier post, the author described leaving Copilot, mainly due to the introduction of "premium request" plans, which restricted access to advanced features. This article serves as a follow-up after several weeks away from Copilot, offering a hands-on comparison between the two services.

### Key Takeaways

- **Transition Decision:** The shift from Copilot was spurred by frustrations with new subscription models and limitations on premium requests.
- **Cursor Overview:** The author joined Cursor's $20/mo plan, which, although pricier than Copilot, offers unlimited access to their "auto" model and fewer frustrating restrictions or errors.
- **Quality of Suggestions:** Cursor's weakest model is described as more stable and capable than Copilot's available models, with fewer issues such as getting "distracted" or requiring conversation resummarization.
- **Stability and Updates:** Cursor is highlighted as being less prone to disruptive updates and regressions, contrasting with Copilot’s frequent unsatisfactory changes. The author speculates about declining quality assurance at Microsoft.
- **Limitations Noted:** Minor irritations persist, particularly with extension compatibility, as Microsoft does not give Cursor full access to all VSCode features. Cursor’s interface, being a fork of VSCode, also exhibits some differences.
- **Overall Satisfaction:** Despite these minor nuisances, the author finds Cursor much more reliable for daily software development.

### Community Engagement

The article concludes with an open invitation for fellow developers to share their own experiences with Copilot and competing solutions. UsualResult clarifies they are not affiliated with either product and hopes their account will help others choose suitable tools for their workflow.
