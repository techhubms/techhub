# Golazo: A Framework for Streamlined Engineering

**Author:** Ben Martens

Golazo is a newly released open-source framework, published by Microsoft, that helps engineering teams achieve transparency and efficiency. Golazo introduces a practical, design-first workflow centered on documentation, peer signoff, and collaborative retrospectives.

## Key Features

- **Design documentation before code:** Each work item begins with a concise design doc offering clear requirements and context.
- **Multiple peer reviews:** Engineering work requires peer signoff prior to coding, preventing last-minute architectural surprises during pull request reviews.
- **Visual workflow boards:** Teams track progress and collaborate using visual boards.
- **Shared ownership:** No assigned workstream owners; engineers can pick up any ticket, supported by documented knowledge and team conversation.
- **Customer validation:** Feedback and validation from end-users are central to the process.
- **Rapid iteration:** Work items are scoped to less than two weeks for fast, manageable delivery.

## Team Collaboration

Golazo is built for asynchronous team operation. It works both for hybrid teams (remote/in-person mix) and traditional in-person engineering organizations. Team health is maintained through:

- Daily standups focusing on lessons learned and actionable insights rather than status reports
- Regular retrospectives to assess team efficiency and celebrate wins
- Inclusive planning sessions ensuring diverse perspectives are heard and integrated

## Knowledge Management

Design documents and peer conversations curate a lasting knowledge base. This knowledge is a valuable resource for onboarding, architectural review, and even AI coding agents or LLMs supporting the team.

Golazo is currently available as version 1.0 and is published in the [Azure Compute Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-compute-blog/bg-p/AzureCompute).
