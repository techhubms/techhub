# Structuring a GNN-Based Next Activity Prediction for Business Process Mining

*Posted by Street_Car_1297*

This post discusses the early stages of a project aimed at using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict the next event in business process data, specifically helpdesk support traces stored in CSV files.

## Project and Data Overview

- **Goal:** Build a model for next activity prediction at the node level using graph representations of business processes.
- **Input Data:** A CSV representing process tracesâ€”each trace becomes a graph (a Directly-Follows Graph) where nodes represent events or activities.
- **Dataset Size:** 4,580 separate process instances (graphs) with an average of 7 nodes each and 15 total activity types (labels).

## Core Modeling Questions

1. **Model Architecture**: Considering a 3-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), but open to community suggestions for architectures better suited to sequence-based node prediction within process graphs.
2. **Handling Multiple Instances**: Unsure whether to treat 4,580 traces as separate graphs for training or to merge them into a single large graph while preserving per-node instance information. Also seeking advice on batching strategies for GNNs with many small graphs versus constructing a global graph for training.

## Additional Context

- The use case involves learning to predict the next activity in what is essentially a sequence, but modeled as a graph structure to capture more complex dependencies than standard sequence models.
- The author notes a lack of practical examples or published studies directly matching this scenario, highlighting both the novelty and challenge of the task.

## Community Collaboration

- Street_Car_1297 encourages feedback, especially from those experienced in GNNs or process data, looking for recommendations on model structure, data batching, and best practices for graph-based activity prediction.
