# Scaling Azure Functions Python with orjson

## Introduction

Delivering high-performance serverless applications is essential for Azure Functions, which powers workloads like APIs, event processing, and automation. A major contributor to overall performance is JSON serialization and deserialization for Python-based functions, whether they're interfacing via HTTP, Event Hubs, Service Bus, or Cosmos DB. Recognizing this, Microsoft has introduced support for [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson)—a fast, Rust-based JSON library—in the Python worker for Azure Functions.

## What is orjson, and Why Does It Matter?

- **orjson** is a performance-oriented library for JSON serialization/deserialization, leveraging Rust for memory efficiency and speed.
- Azure Functions Python Library now auto-detects orjson: if it's found in your requirements.txt or virtual environment, Azure Functions switches to orjson, bypassing the slower standard Python json module. This improvement requires no code change in your apps.
- JSON serialization is critical for any serverless function processing messages, API payloads, or integrating event-driven Azure services.

## Why orjson Beats Traditional Libraries

- Written in Rust for optimized memory handling
- 2-4x faster than ujson, up to 10x faster than json for large or deeply nested payloads
- Generates more compact output—useful for bandwidth-sensitive applications
- Strict RFC 8259 compliance for interoperability

## Measured Performance Gains

### HTTP and Event Hub Benchmarks

**Locally:**

- HTTP: 10,000 requests (20KB payload)
  - json: 10:01 min total, avg request 3.08s, median 2.16s, dropped: 289
  - orjson: 6:01 min total, avg request 1.8s, median 1.51s, dropped: 0
- Event Hub: 1,000 messages (20KB)
  - json: 4:11 min, 3.98 messages/sec
  - orjson: 2:50 min, 5.88 messages/sec

**Cloud Results (Azure Functions Flex Consumption):**

- 100 instances, 2GB RAM, Azure Load Testing for throughput (`req/s`) and latency (ms)
- At 1KB to 992KB JSON payloads, orjson improved throughput by up to 6% and reduced average response time by up to 400ms
- For Service Bus, orjson showed +38% message rate at 1,000 messages, up to +15% at 10,000 messages

## Integration Challenges & Lessons

- Compatibility across supported Python versions (3.9–3.13) required robust testing
- Conditional loading means orjson is only used if present; otherwise, fallback to json
- Accurate benchmarks needed to account for cold starts, payload variance, and cloud transience

## Success Stories

- Up to 40% reduction in average request times with larger payloads
- Event Hub scenarios: up to 50% higher message throughput
- Drop-in improvement by merely adding orjson as a dependency, no code refactoring required

## Next Steps for Developers

- Review [Azure Functions Python Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-python?tabs=get-started%2Casgi%2Capplication-level&pivots=python-mode-decorators) for best practices
- Consider adding orjson to requirements.txt for immediate performance upgrades
- Monitor upcoming enhancements for deeper worker-level optimizations

## Conclusion

Native orjson support in Azure Functions for Python apps offers developers fast, easy performance benefits for JSON-heavy serverless workloads. Results are both significant and practical for production scenarios, especially for applications with high message volume or large payloads.
