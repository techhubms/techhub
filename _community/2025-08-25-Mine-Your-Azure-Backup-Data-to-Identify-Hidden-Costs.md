Adeelaziz shares a practical method for identifying hidden costs in Azure by analyzing backup data with Power BI and PowerShell, providing tips for optimizing cloud storage spend.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Mine Your Azure Backup Data to Identify Hidden Costs

**Author:** Adeelaziz

Managing cloud costs requires diligent monitoring, especially with backup data that may outlive its purpose. In this post, I share how unused (or 'orphaned') Azure backups can result in unnecessary chargesâ€”and how leveraging Power BI and PowerShell let me uncover and address this issue.

## The Problem: Orphaned Backups

Azure backups can become orphaned in several ways:

- Forgotten one-time backups
- Deleted VMs where the backup service is still running
- Workloads removed from protection due to policy changes
- Resource migrations where backups are left behind

These backups don't always serve a purpose, but as long as they're retained, you may continue paying for them.

## Discovery Process

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Used the Azure Business Continuity Center for core backup data
   - Wrote a PowerShell script to extract `LastBackupTime` and other relevant metadata from backups
2. **Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Imported datasets into Power BI
   - Built visualizations to show backup usage trends over time
   - Flagged backups with no recent activity or whose related resources no longer exist

## Results and Cost Optimization

With this approach, I was able to:

- Identify and remove forgotten or obsolete backups
- Track when workloads were excluded due to policy changes
- Detect and act on backups left after resource migrations

With Azure's **soft-delete** enabled, deleting unwanted backups drops the billed storage to zero, preventing further charges.

## Recommendations

- Routinely audit your Azure backup inventory
- Visualize backup activity and cross-reference with current workloads
- Use automation (PowerShell) for regular metadata extraction
- Take action on backups without a valid purpose

**Do your backups have an untold story? Begin exploring your data and you might save more than you think!**
