description: "This announcement introduces the public preview of using Azure Logic Apps (Standard) as Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The post walks through two main approaches: registering Logic Apps connectors as MCP servers with Azure API Center, and enabling Logic Apps as remote MCP servers for greater control and flexibility. Developers and IT admins can leverage these capabilities to compose modular, reusable MCP tools, streamline integration, and centralize management via API Center, all within Azure’s enterprise-grade workflow platform."

KentWeareMSFT announces the public preview of MCP server support in Azure Logic Apps, describing new ways for developers to build and manage modular agents with improved integration and governance.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Build Modular Agents with Logic Apps MCP Servers (Public Preview)

Azure Logic Apps (Standard) can now function as Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, giving organizations a new way to build, manage, and reuse agent capabilities. By transforming Logic Apps connectors into modular MCP tools, developers can:

- Rapidly construct scalable, adaptable agents using reusable connectors
- Integrate data access, messaging, and orchestration as specialized capabilities
- Reduce development overhead and improve reusability
- Integrate and manage these tools within the Azure ecosystem

## Two Approaches to Creating Logic Apps MCP Servers

### 1. Register Connectors as MCP Servers Using Azure API Center

- **Streamlined experience** for building MCP servers directly from managed connectors
- Select connectors and their actions to generate MCP servers and related tools
- Automated Logic Apps workflow creation with Easy Auth authentication setup
- MCP servers are registered in the API Center enterprise catalog for discoverability and management
- Benefits both admins (central management) and developers (easy onboarding of agent solutions)

#### Getting Started

- Refer to the [product documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/create-mcp-server-api-center)
- Watch [demo videos](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/logic-apps---mcp-demos/4452175)

### 2. Enable Logic Apps as Remote MCP Servers

- Ideal for customers with existing investments or needing advanced control
- Requirements for a Logic App to act as an MCP server:
  - One or more workflows with HTTP Request triggers and HTTP Response actions
  - Meaningful schema and descriptions in triggers
  - `host.json` configured for MCP capabilities
  - App registration setup in Microsoft Entra with Easy Auth configured

#### Getting Started

- See the [product documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/set-up-model-context-protocol-server-standard)
- Watch [demo videos](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/logic-apps---mcp-demos/4452175)

## Feedback and Availability

Both approaches are available worldwide in public preview. For feedback or questions, fill out the [official form](https://aka.ms/MCP-Servers-LogicApps).
