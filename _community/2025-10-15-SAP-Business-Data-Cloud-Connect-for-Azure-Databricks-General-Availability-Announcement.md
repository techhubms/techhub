# SAP Business Data Cloud Connect for Azure Databricks Now Available

**Author:** AnaviNahar

## Overview

SAP Business Data Cloud (SAP BDC) Connect for Azure Databricks is now generally available. This integration allows Azure Databricks customers to connect their SAP BDC environment directly to their existing Azure Databricks instances, enabling live, bi-directional data sharing without the need to copy data across systems.

## Key Features

- **Live Bi-Directional Data Sharing:** Connect SAP BDC with Azure Databricks securely and efficiently, supporting real-time and dynamic data interactions.
- **Data Security & Governance:** Enforces governance, helps prevent compliance gaps, and eliminates data silos within enterprise environments.
- **Simplified Analytics and Data Engineering:** Teams can mount SAP BDC data products in Azure Databricks Unity Catalog, streamlining access and analysis alongside existing business data.
- **Delta Sharing & Unity Catalog:** Data products in SAP BDC are treated as native assets in Databricks via Delta Sharing, supporting unified data operations.

## Benefits

- **No Data Copying Needed:** Access SAP data directly without creating duplicate datasets.
- **Accelerated Insights:** Focus on extracting insights from unified data instead of manual data gathering or building semantics.
- **Support for AI & ML:** Integrates with analytics, machine learning, and AI workflows on Azure Databricks, enhancing operational intelligence and business decision-making.
- **Reduced Maintenance Costs:** Lowers the need for manual interventions and custom connectors.

## Security and Compliance

- **Trusted Connections:** Requires approval from both SAP BDC and Azure Databricks platforms before bi-directional data sharing is enabled.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Data sharing and governance features ensure compliance across regulatory and business requirements.

## Complementary Capabilities
