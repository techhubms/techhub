# Orchestrating Multi-Agent Intelligence with Microsoft Agent Framework and MCP

## Overview

Building reliable AI systems requires modular and stateful orchestration that enables seamless agent collaboration. The Microsoft Agent Framework, in combination with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), delivers these foundations—offering built-in memory, tracing, and workflow orchestration. This article demonstrates practical implementations of four multi-agentic patterns: Single Agent, Reflection, Handoff, and Magentic Orchestration, showing different collaboration strategies for real-world scenarios.

## Business Scenario: Contoso Customer Support Chatbot

The example implementation features a multi-domain customer support chatbot for Contoso, designed to handle inquiries like billing anomalies, promotion eligibility, account locks, and data usage. The bot combines structured enterprise data (e.g., CRM, billing, promotions) with unstructured policy documents (retrieved using vector embeddings) to deliver relevant, policy-aligned responses. MCP orchestrates calls to various tools and data sources, supporting auditable responses and robust reasoning.

## Architecture & Core Concepts

- **Base Agent**: All patterns inherit from a common base agent class, providing unified interfaces for messaging, tool use, and state management.
- **Backend**: FastAPI orchestrates session routing, agent execution, and workflow coordination.
- **Frontend**: React (or Streamlit) UI streams responses and visualizes agent reasoning.

### Modular Runtime and Pattern Swapping

Developers can swap agentic coordination strategies (e.g., Single, Reflection, Handoff, Magentic) by changing configuration values without altering backend, frontend, or memory code. A shared execution pipeline and MCP integration ensure consistent and deterministic runtime behavior, whether running locally or using durable storage (Cosmos DB) in production.

#### Example Code Snippets

```python
# Dynamic agent pattern loading

agent_module_path = os.getenv("AGENT_MODULE")
agent_module = __import__(agent_module_path, fromlist=["Agent"])
Agent = getattr(agent_module, "Agent")

# Common MCP setup across all patterns

async def _create_tools(self, headers: Dict[str, str]) -> List[MCPStreamableHTTPTool] | None:
    if not self.mcp_server_uri:
        return None
    return [MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
        name="mcp-streamable",
        url=self.mcp_server_uri,
        headers=headers,
        timeout=30,
        request_timeout=30,
    )]
```

### State Management

Two storage strategies:

- **Cosmos DB**: Enterprise-ready, durable storage for conversation threads and checkpoints.
- **In-Memory Store**: Fast, ephemeral storage for prototyping or lightweight scenarios.

Both support:

- **Session isolation**
- **Checkpointing** for workflow recovery
- **Thread-based abstraction**—enabling consistent agent communication

MCP standardizes agent-tool interactions, supporting both structured (e.g., databases) and unstructured sources (e.g., policy docs).

### Core Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Swap agents, tools, or storage without disruption
- **Stateful Coordination**: Agents coordinate via shared/local state
- **Deterministic Workflows**: Predictable, auditable execution
- **Unified Execution Lifecycle** across agentic patterns

## Multi-Agent Patterns: Workflow and Coordination

### 1. Single Agent Pattern

A single, autonomous agent handles all reasoning and tool interactions, storing memory for contextual, stateful responses. Direct, predictable workflow—suitable for simple, domain-bound tasks.

### 2. Reflection Pattern

A primary agent drafts a response; a reviewer agent critiques and suggests improvements; the primary then revises and returns a refined answer. Enhances output quality with transparent, traceable QA.

### 3. Handoff Pattern

User input is triaged by an intent classifier, then routed to a specialist agent for the relevant domain. Conversation is only re-routed if user intent shifts domains. Each routing and handoff is logged for auditability.

### 4. Magentic Orchestration

A manager (planner) agent decomposes goals into subtasks managed by specialist agents. Tasks are tracked in a ledger, agents may work in parallel, and results are synthesized into a single response. Enables open-ended, multi-faceted workflows with coordinated agent collaboration.

| Requirement                | Single Agent | Reflection | Handoff | Magentic |
|----------------------------|--------------|------------|---------|----------|
| Simple, domain tasks       | ✔            | ✔          |         |          |
| Quality assurance/review   |              | ✔          |         | ✔        |
| Multi-domain routing       |              |            | ✔       | ✔        |
| Open/complex workflows     |              |            |         | ✔        |
| Parallel agent execution   |              |            |         | ✔        |
| Predictable, low latency   | ✔            | ✔          | ✔       |          |

## How to Get Started

- Visit the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenAIWorkshop/tree/int-agentic/agentic_ai/agents/agent_framework) to access code samples and further documentation.
- Experiment with agent patterns for your use cases by swapping runtimes and orchestration logic.

## Advanced: Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

The framework supports advanced patterns such as HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) for use cases like fraud detection, integrating human review directly into the AI decision-making pipeline. Read the [detailed blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/building-human-in-the-loop-ai-workflows-with-microsoft-agent-framework/4460342) for an in-depth look.

## Conclusion

By combining the Agent Framework, MCP, and flexible state management, developers can build scalable, modular, and reliable AI systems capable of handling domain-spanning, auditable workflows and collaborative reasoning—whether for simple customer Q&A or complex, multi-agent orchestration.
