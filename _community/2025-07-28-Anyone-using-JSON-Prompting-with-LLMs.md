In this community article, Abhishekmiz shares their experience using JSON prompting with LLMs like GitHub Copilot, focusing on structured instructions for code generation.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Structured JSON Prompting with LLMs and GitHub Copilot

Abhishekmiz explores the practice of using structured, JSON-based prompts to improve the quality of outputs from large language models (LLMs), such as GitHub Copilot. The main points discussed include:

### Problem with Vague Prompts

- Traditional natural language prompts (e.g., "Give me a React component for a user profile, make it look nice") often produce inconsistent or unsatisfactory code.

### Advantages of JSON Prompts

- Using a well-defined JSON structure to specify requirements—such as the component name, data properties, styling framework, and output language—leads to:
  - More accurate and relevant code generation.
  - Consistent results across different prompts.
  - Easier integration into workflows or automated tools.
  - Better prompt clarity for both users and LLMs, resembling API request patterns.

### Practical Example

```json
{
  "task": "generate_react_component",
  "component_name": "UserProfileCard",
  "data_props": ["user_name", "profile_picture_url", "bio", "social_links"],
  "styling_framework": "Tailwind CSS",
  "output_format": "typescript_tsx"
}
```

- Applying structured prompts like this significantly enhances the LLM’s output compared to loosely defined instructions.

### Benefits Experienced

- Improved reliability and specificity in generated components.
- Encourages users to clearly define their requirements, supporting a mindset similar to API design.

### Recommendations

- If struggling with vague prompt results, try adopting structured JSON-style prompting—especially when working with AI code generation tools like Copilot.

### Conclusion

Abhishekmiz’s practical approach to prompt engineering offers a valuable framework for developers utilizing LLMs, promoting more efficient and consistent coding assistance.
