# Issues Accessing Gemini 2.5 Pro Model After GitHub Copilot Chat Update

**Author:** EchoingAngel

## Summary

After a recent update to GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code, users—including the original poster—have lost access to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Attempts to restore the model through the Gemini settings (including entering an API key) have been unsuccessful, as there is no method to specify the exact model, and the options provided appear incompatible with the AI Studio API key.

The discussion highlights frustrations among users after the update:

- Some note this issue was already present in Copilot's insider builds and is now affecting the stable release.
- A user switched from insiders to regular VS Code previously to escape the issue, but finds it in the main branch now.
- Alternatives such as using Cline are mentioned, though concerns persist about potential API costs, even when keys are marked "free".
- Users criticize the lack of thorough testing before updates, noting workarounds like manually adding context for each query due to the model's removal.

## Common Themes

- **Model Access Issues:** The Gemini 2.5 Pro model has vanished post-update, and available settings do not allow specifying this particular model.
- **API Limitations:** Options to enter an API key don't help restore functionality, and options provided don't work with the AI Studio API key.
- **Community Frustrations:** Several posters express dissatisfaction with the release process and the apparent lack of testing before production rollouts.
- **Exploring Alternatives:** Some users mention evaluating alternate tools (e.g., Cline), but remain concerned about cost tracking with these services.

## Conclusion

The post documents challenges and negative impacts on developer workflow following the recent GitHub Copilot Chat update, focusing on loss of critical AI model functionality and community-driven troubleshooting efforts.
