# AI-Powered Migration and Modernization—Secure, Resilient, and Ready for Innovation

**Author:** GabiPacheco

## Introduction

Accelerate your migration and modernization journey with Azure Essentials, Azure Migrate, and GitHub Copilot—empowering organizations to become "Frontier Firms" that embrace AI and cloud innovation. Microsoft's Azure Accelerate initiative supports these efforts with expert guidance and investments, ensuring security, resilience, and future-readiness for agentic applications.

Join the [Migrate and Modernize Summit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/events/launch-events/migrate-and-modernize-summit) to explore new AI-assisted migration tools.

## Why Secure and Resilient Migration Matters

Migrating to Azure is a strategic step, positioning organizations to innovate using AI and cloud technologies. Secure, resilient migration unlocks collaboration between human and AI agents, reinforces customer trust, and enables data-driven growth. AI-enhanced tools like [Azure Migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-services-overview?view=migrate-classic) and [GitHub Copilot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/github/copilot) accelerate this process, while prioritizing security and operational continuity.

## Foundation for AI Readiness: Secure Migration Practices

- Accelerate discovery, code upgrades, and refactoring with AI-assisted approaches using Azure and Copilot.
- Embed security throughout every migration phase to establish trust, compliance, and integrity for future AI workloads ([AI-ready landing zones](https://github.com/Azure/AI-Landing-Zones)).
- Ensure protection of sensitive data, regulatory compliance, and effective AI model deployment.

## Azure Essentials: Blueprint for Resilient Migration

Azure Essentials provides proven methodologies to migrate confidently and securely. Organizations follow three key phases:

### Phase One: Readiness and Foundation

- Inventory and dependency mapping with [Azure Migrate](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-migrate/?msockid=28f1ae6763066aeb063fbb2d624e6b7a).
- Utilize migration guides for complete preparation.
- Implement foundational controls:
  - Identity management
  - Encrypted communications
  - Network segmentation (see [Azure Security Benchmark](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/introduction) and [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/)).
- Design for availability and redundancy.
- Create [platform landing zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/) for governance.
- Apply financial best practices: [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/offers/hybrid-benefit/?msockid=28f1ae6763066aeb063fbb2d624e6b7a), [FinOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-computing/finops/overview).

### Phase Two: Design and Govern

- Combine Azure Migrate and [GitHub Copilot](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/github/copilot) for code assessment, remediation, and refactoring.
- Integrate built-in security checkpoints, compliance validation, and resiliency testing.
- Apply [Azure RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) and [Azure Security Center](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en/marketplace/apps/Microsoft.AzureSecurityCenter?tab=Overview) automation.
- Document processes and optimize architecture for reliability and security.
- Configure landing zones for scalable and compliant AI workloads.

### Phase Three: Manage and Optimize

- Enforce policies with [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/) and [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction).
- Monitor threats and performance via [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/fundamentals/overview) and [Log Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview?tabs=simple).
- Real-time alerting and oversight.
- Optimize resources with [Microsoft Cost Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/overview-cost-management) and [Azure Advisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-overview).
- Continual improvement with [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/service-guides/?product=popular).

## Azure Accelerate: Expert-Led, Investment-Backed Support
