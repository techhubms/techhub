# Announcing Kubernetes Center (Preview) On Azure Portal

**Author:** Harsha_Nair  
**Published on Azure Infrastructure Blog**

## Overview

Kubernetes Center is a new experience in the Azure Portal, designed to simplify how organizations manage, monitor, and optimize their Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environments at scale. This preview centralizes cluster visibility, brings actionable insights, and unifies critical Kubernetes management features into an intuitive interface.

## Key Features

- **Unified Cluster Management:** View and manage all AKS, AKS Automatic, Fleet Manager, and Managed Namespace resources from a single dashboard.
- **Actionable Insights:** Instantly surface security vulnerabilities, cluster alerts, compliance gaps, and upgrade recommendations in one unified view.
- **Streamlined Experience:** Eliminate the need to switch between services; manage Kubernetes resources, access documentation, and leverage learning resources in context.
- **Centralized Quickstarts:** Easier onboarding and troubleshooting, with relevant documentation and help readily available.

## Azure Portal Enhancements

- Distinct landing experiences are merged into one streamlined management interface.
- A clear overview allows for high-level monitoring, with drill-down pages for detailed cluster insights.
- Fast access to both new and existing clusters, reduced friction for provisioning or deploying applications.

## Security & Compliance

- Integrated with Microsoft Defender for Containers to provide visibility into critical security vulnerabilities and compliance posture across all clusters.
- Consolidated alerts promote faster issue resolution and stronger security governance.

## Multi-Cluster Operations

- Kubernetes Fleet Manager (integrated into the Center) enables scalable management of multiple clusters, supporting version upgrades, policy management, and complex multi-environment coordination.

## Getting Started

- Create your first AKS cluster or deploy an application through the 'Deploy Your Application' workflow in Kubernetes Center.
