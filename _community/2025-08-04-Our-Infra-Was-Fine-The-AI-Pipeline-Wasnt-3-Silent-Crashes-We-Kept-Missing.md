wfgy_engine highlights persistent DevOps challenges in AI pipelines, describing how classic infrastructure issues led to subtle, production-breaking failures and how their team created a problem map and lightweight controls to address them.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

wfgy_engine shares practical insights into stability problems in large language model (LLM) production pipelines that persist despite seemingly healthy infrastructure. While dashboards and health checks appear green, real-world failures emerge when the AI service behaves unexpectedly or fails outright during initial use.

## Common Failure Scenarios

The author identifies classic DevOps issues that manifest as AI problems:

- **Bootstrap Ordering:** Services start before their dependencies are ready (such as empty vector indexes or lagging schema migrations). Everything appears normal, but the LLM calls have no data.
- **Deployment Deadlock:** Circular waits—such as retriever, database, and migrator—lead to a situation where the service "starts" but is never actually useful, leaving it in a zombie state.
- **Pre-Deploy Collapse:** Mismatches in versioning or missing secrets result in model paths that fail as soon as they're used.

## Remediation Techniques

To address these failures, several solutions were implemented:

- **Knowledge Boundary Health Checks:** Test whether the model can appropriately say "don't know" to a canary prompt. Bluffing detected here predicts deployment blunders.
- **Semantic Jump (ΔS) Logging:** Monitoring the semantic shift in evaluation data (ΔS > 0.85) flags deployments where outputs grow fluent but lose logical grounding.
- **Semantic Tree Artifacts:** Incorporate node-level intent and module usage (not just transcripts) into CI artifacts for more effective incident review.
- **First-Request Canary Trio:** The first production request must pass a three-part check—empty query, adversarial, and known-fact. Any failure triggers an immediate halt.

## Tools and Resources

The solutions are intentionally simple, relying on a plain `.txt` control layer to wrap prompts with the necessary checks. No binaries or network dependencies are required, and it’s MIT-licensed and designed to be easily adopted.

A comprehensive "problem map" lists 16 specific failure modes encountered; it is openly shared at: [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/ProblemMap/README.md).

## Community Involvement

The author encourages others experiencing similar "green deployments with red outcomes" to consult the problem map and contribute additional silent failure modes—especially those not caught during staging but visible on first production calls.
