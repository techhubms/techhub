# Deploying Hybrid Azure Logic Apps on K3s for Lightweight, On-Premises Integration

Hybrid deployments of Azure Logic Apps allow organizations to run workflows close to their on-premises data for performance and integration flexibility. In this guide, **praveensri** outlines a practical approach using a lightweight [K3s](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes distribution, streamlining infrastructure needs particularly for edge or resource-constrained environments.

## Why K3s?

- **Lightweight Kubernetes**: K3s offers reduced overhead while preserving Kubernetes API compatibility, making it suitable for on-premises or edge setups.
- **Ideal for Hybrid Logic Apps**: Lets you deploy and run Azure Logic Apps Standard near local data sources, like on-prem SQL Servers and SMB file shares, without the burden of a full Kubernetes cluster.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare the K3s Cluster

- **Host Environment**: Uses Windows 11 with Docker Desktop (WSL2 integration).
- **Software Installation**:
    - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), ensure WSL2 is selected.
    - Install required tools via Chocolatey and PowerShell:

      ```powershell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;
      iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
      choco install kubernetes-cli -y
      choco install kubernetes-helm -y
      choco install k3d -y
      ```

    - Create a single-node K3s cluster:

      ```powershell
      k3d cluster create
      # Remove default load balancer (Traefik), if it interferes with required ports:
      kubectl delete svc traefik -n kube-system
      kubectl delete deployment traefik -n kube-system
      ```

### 2. Connect Kubernetes Cluster to Azure Arc

- Register your K3s cluster with [Azure Arc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/), enabling management from Azure. Follow the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/set-up-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment-requirements#connect-kubernetes-cluster-to-azure-arc) for step-by-step guidance.

### 3. Configure Azure Container Apps Extension and Environment

- Set up the Azure Container Apps extension for your cluster. (CoreDNS customizations for Azure Local can be skipped in this setup.)

### 4. Configure Storage (SQL Server and SMB)

- **SQL Database**: Used by Logic Apps for runtime operations and history logs. The author:
    - Set up SQL Server 2022 with SQL authentication on the Windows host.
    - Created a dedicated SQL admin user ([detailed instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/set-up-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment-requirements#create-sql-server-storage-provider)).
    - Connection validation script:

      ```powershell
      $connectionString = "Server=<server IP>;Initial Catalog=<db>;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=<sqluser>;Password=<password>;..."
      try {
        $connection = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection
        $connection.ConnectionString = $connectionString
        $connection.Open()
        Write-Host "✅ Connection successful"
        $connection.Close()
      } catch {
        Write-Host "❌ Connection failed: $(---

.Exception.Message)"
      }
      ```

- **SMB File Share**: Handles local artifact storage.
    - Create a local Windows user for the SMB share:

      ```powershell
      $Username = "k3suser"
      $Password = ConvertTo-SecureString "<password>" -AsPlainText -Force
      $FullName = "K3s user"
      $Description = "Created via PowerShell"
      New-LocalUser -Name $Username -Password $Password -FullName $FullName -Description $Description
      Add-LocalGroupMember -Group "Users" -Member $Username
      ```

    - Set up the shared folder with the appropriate permissions ([detailed steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/set-up-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment-requirements#set-up-your-smb-file-share-on-windows)).

### 5. Create Hybrid Logic Apps (Standard)

- Use the Azure Portal to create Logic Apps Standard workflows.
- Configure the app to use your SQL connection and SMB path.
- Use the designer to develop and deploy workflows. Hybrid Logic Apps now run on your K3s cluster, accessing local data securely and efficiently.

## Additional Notes

- Most of the process aligns with Microsoft’s official documentation, except for the lightweight K3s specifics.
- This deployment strategy is beneficial for organizations seeking to modernize integration (e.g., BizTalk migration), ensuring flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with edge computing needs.

For further details, refer to [Set up your own infrastructure for Standard logic app workflows - Azure Logic Apps | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/set-up-standard-workflows-hybrid-deployment-requirements).
