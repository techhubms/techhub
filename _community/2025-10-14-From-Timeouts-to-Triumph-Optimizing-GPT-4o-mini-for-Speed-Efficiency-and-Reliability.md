psundars presents a practical breakdown of optimizing GPT-4o-mini deployments on Azure OpenAI—addressing performance bottlenecks and enhancing reliability through data-driven engineering and architectural best practices.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Improving Performance and Reliability in Large-Scale Azure OpenAI Workloads

High-volume generative AI systems, particularly those handling thousands of concurrent GPT-4o-mini requests, can face timeout and throttling challenges. psundars investigates such a scenario in production, where sporadic 408 (timeout) and 429 (throttling) errors degraded the user experience. Initial diagnoses suggested PTU capacity issues, but telemetry from Azure Data Explorer (Kusto), Azure API Management (APIM), and OpenAI billing revealed:

- PTUs were operating within expected performance.
- Token generation speed was steady at 8–10 ms TBT.
- The main bottleneck was requests demanding 6K–8K tokens, exceeding the completion window.

## Engineering Solutions Implemented

### 1. Token Optimization

- Empirical throughput for GPT-4o-mini: ~33 tokens/sec or ~2,000 tokens per 60 seconds.
- Synchronous requests were capped at max_tokens = 2000.
- Streaming responses enabled delivery of longer content without hitting timeout limits.

### 2. Spillover Routing for Continuity

- Multi-region spillover used Azure Front Door and APIM Premium.
- Requests met with 429 errors or queue saturation were rerouted to secondary, standard deployments.
- Graceful degradation maintained continuity during regional or capacity surges.

### 3. Policy Enforcement With APIM

- Inbound APIM policies dynamically inspected and limited max_tokens.
- On 408/429 errors, APIM executed retries and spillover rerouting logic.

## Results

- **Latency improvement:** Faster end-to-end responses across workloads.
- **Error reduction:** 408/429 errors dropped from >1% to near zero.
- **Cost savings:** 60% reduction in average tokens per request.
- **Scalability:** Spillover routing provided ongoing resilience.
- **Governance:** A reusable control framework for future AI workloads was established.

## Lessons Learned

1. Latency is not always solved by adding capacity; analyze workload characteristics.
2. Proper token budgets are essential for SLA compliance.
3. Elastic architectures using spillover enable resilience.
4. Rich telemetry (KQL, token, latency tracking) streamlines diagnostics.

## Conclusion

By combining telemetry-driven analysis, architectural adjustment, and automated governance, psundars and team achieved measurable gains in speed, reliability, and cost for Azure OpenAI workloads. This approach serves as a blueprint for scaling resilient AI solutions on Azure.
