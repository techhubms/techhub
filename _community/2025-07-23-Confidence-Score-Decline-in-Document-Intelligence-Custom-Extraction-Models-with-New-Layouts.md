# Doc Intelligence: Custom Extraction Model | Confidence Score Deterioration with New Formats/Layouts

**Author:** aristotelisc

Hi everyone,

I am experimenting with custom extraction models in the Azure Document Intelligence service and have encountered a puzzling issue. My goal is to understand how model confidence scores behave when documents of significantly different format or layout are introduced during training.

## Experiment Setup

- **Initial Phase:**
  - Trained models using documents all in the same format (with some minor issues like picture quality and rotation).
  - Gradually increased training data by increments of 5 documents, retraining after each addition.
  - After each retraining, evaluated model confidence against a fixed, unseen holdout set (same format as training data).
- **Second Phase:**
  - Upon reaching 35 documents in the same format, began adding documents with distinctly different formats and layouts (in batches of 10).
  - Retrained the model after each addition.
  - Monitored confidence scores against the unchanged holdout set.

## Observations

- Adding documents with new formats/layouts caused a notable drop in confidence scores when evaluating the original-format holdout set.
- Confidence scores did not recover even with further retraining or more samples added.
- See attached graph for confidence score evolution after each training phase.

## Question for the Community

Has anyone experienced a similar confidence drop when introducing varied input formats to a custom extraction model?

- What are the underlying causes for this behaviorâ€”does the model "forget" the original format, or is there an underlying limitation in the training process?
- Are there best practices to mitigate this decline and retain high confidence on multiple formats?

**Any insights or suggestions would be appreciated.**
