# Is `goto` Ever Cleaner than `while` in C# Loops?

**Author:** Foreign-Radish1641

## The Debate: `goto` vs `while` in Repetitive Actions

This community thread examines whether using a `goto` statement is ever preferable or clearer than a traditional `while` loop in C#. The discussion is rooted in practical code samples and draws on years of development experience.

### Standard Loop Example

The typical way to request input until a valid action is chosen:

```csharp
while (true) {
    Console.WriteLine("choose an action (attack, wait, run):");
    string input = Console.ReadLine();
    if (input is "attack" or "wait" or "run") {
        break;
    }
}
```

### More Complex Version (Multiple Branches)

```csharp
while (true) {
    Console.WriteLine("choose an action (attack, wait, run):");
    string input = Console.ReadLine();

    if (input is "attack") {
        Console.WriteLine("you attack");
        break;
    } else if (input is "wait") {
        Console.WriteLine("nothing happened");
    } else if (input is "run") {
        Console.WriteLine("you run");
        break;
    }
}
```

### Alternative with `goto`

```csharp
ChooseAction:
Console.WriteLine("choose an action (attack, wait, run):");
string input = Console.ReadLine();

if (input is "attack") {
    Console.WriteLine("you attack");
} else if (input is "wait") {
    Console.WriteLine("nothing happened");
    goto ChooseAction;
} else if (input is "run") {
    Console.WriteLine("you run");
}
```

The argument is that `goto` can sometimes make loops "explicit" and potentially more readable when the flow is simple.

## Community Opinions

- **Stick to `while` loops:** Most developers advise sticking with established looping constructs like `while`, citing that they're what most readers expect and are easier to reason about, especially in teams.

- **`goto` has rare use cases:** Only use `goto` to break out of complex, deeply nested logic where restructuring would otherwise greatly complicate the code. Even then, alternatives like extracting code into a function (and using `return`) are preferred.

    - _Example: "Even then, I think I've only had to do that once in 22 years of using C#."_

- **Readability beats "cleanness":** The term "cleaner" is vague—what matters more is readability and maintainability. Indentation and structured blocks let you quickly see scope and control flow.

- **Alternatives to `goto`:** Using `continue`, introducing clearer loop conditions, or code refactoring to use functions/methods to manage control flow are nearly always better choices.

- **Compiler Details:** Internally, even `while (true)` can compile down to similar jump instructions, so performance isn't a deciding factor—it's all about source code clarity.

- **Comic Reference:** [xkcd 292](https://xkcd.com/292) is humorously cited regarding dangerous use of `goto`.

- **Summary:** Use `goto` as a last resort. For almost all everyday repetitive input scenarios, `while` or `for` loops are the right, most maintainable choice.

## Example: Clean Pattern for User Input

```csharp
string input = "";
while (input is not "attack" or "run") {
    Console.WriteLine("choose an action (attack, wait, run):");
    input = Console.ReadLine();

    if (input is "attack") {
        Console.WriteLine("you attack");
    } else if (input is "wait") {
        Console.WriteLine("nothing happened");
    } else if (input is "run") {
        Console.WriteLine("you run");
    }
}
```

## Key Lessons

- Use standard loop constructs for clarity and maintainability.
- Resort to `goto` only in rare, justified cases (deeply nested error handling, legacy interop, etc.).
- Prefer refactoring code and leveraging functions for managing flow.
- Optimize for team understanding and code review friendliness.
