In this post, LondonPilot discusses issues with EF Core migrations caused by .NET SDK version mismatches, seeking clarification on the roles of global.json and .csproj target frameworks.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Understanding the Need for `global.json` in .NET Projects

### Context

LondonPilot describes an issue faced while maintaining a .NET project. Attempting to create an Entity Framework (EF) Core migration resulted in the error:
> "The “DiscoverPrecompressedAssets” task failed unexpectedly. System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added."

A [solution found online](https://steveellwoodnlc.medium.com/the-discoverprecompressedassets-task-failed-unexpectedly-2b544195e1fe) largely resolved the problem. However, an additional step—installing the specific SDK version—was needed. Listing installed SDKs revealed only .NET 9 was present, even though the app targeted .NET 8.

Despite all `.csproj` files properly listing target frameworks, the app compiled and ran in debug mode with just .NET 9 installed. Running EF Core migrations, however, required:

- Adding a `global.json` specifying the necessary .NET SDK version
- Installing the corresponding SDK version

### Key Questions

1. **Why is `global.json` needed for specifying the SDK version when target frameworks appear in `.csproj`?**
2. **Why can the program compile and run without the relevant SDK, but advanced CLI tools (like EF Core migrations) fail unless it’s installed?**

### Explanation

#### Project File (`.csproj`) vs. `global.json`

- The `.csproj` project file defines the **target framework** for your project (e.g., `net8.0`). This tells the compiler what runtime your code should run against and which APIs are available.
- `global.json` allows you to **fix** the SDK version used by the CLI (e.g., `dotnet build`, `dotnet ef`). Without it, the CLI will use the latest installed SDK (here, .NET 9) that matches (or can interpret) your project.

#### Why Did it Work Without the Right SDK?

- Many .NET SDKs are backward-compatible: the .NET 9 SDK can often build and debug apps targeting .NET 8, using reference assemblies for .NET 8.
- However, tools like EF Core migrations sometimes rely on specific behaviors or features present only in a matching or older SDK. They may fail, or produce unexpected errors, if the SDK versions diverge.

#### Why Both Steps Were Needed

- **Adding `global.json`**: Forces tools to use a specific SDK version (e.g., .NET 8) rather than a later SDK, ensuring command-line tools behave as expected.
- **Installing the SDK**: If the SDK specified in `global.json` isn’t installed, commands will fail to run. Both the SDK and `global.json` are needed for reproducible builds and consistent dev team behavior.

### Summary

For consistent CLI tool behavior—especially across teams or build servers—`global.json` pins the SDK version. Relying on just the latest installed SDK can lead to mysterious errors during advanced scenarios like EF Core migrations, even if most build/debug scenarios work.

### Practical Recommendations

- Commit a `global.json` with your desired SDK version to source control.
- Ensure all contributors/installations have the SDKs in `global.json`.
- Use `dotnet --list-sdks` to verify which SDKs are present and troubleshoot issues.
