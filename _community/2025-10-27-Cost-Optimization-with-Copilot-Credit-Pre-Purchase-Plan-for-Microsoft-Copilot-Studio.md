# Cost Optimization with Copilot Credit Pre-Purchase Plan for Microsoft Copilot Studio

## Introduction

As organizations increase their use of Microsoft Copilot Studio for tasks like building custom agents or integrating with Dynamics 365, budgeting and cost management become more important. The Copilot Credit Pre-Purchase Plan (P3) is a one-year, upfront payment option that provides volume discounts and automates billing to help technical teams stay focused on delivering solutions.

## What is the Copilot Credit Pre-Purchase Plan (P3)?

- **P3 is a pay-up-front, one-year plan** that lets you pre-purchase a pool of Copilot Credit Commit Units (CCCUs).
- As you use Copilot Credits across Microsoft Copilot Studio, Dynamics 365 first-party agents, or Copilot Chat, credits are automatically deducted from your balance.
- Higher purchase tiers provide progressive volume discounts.
- [See pricing details](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2320995).

## How It Works

- Pre-purchase the number of CCCUs you expect to use for one year.
- Credits are consumed automatically as you use eligible Copilot-powered services.
- If you run out before the end of the year, you can purchase more or switch to pay-as-you-go.
- Unused credits expire at the end of the plan's one-year term.

## Example Scenario

A retail company operating 15 custom Copilot Studio agents forecasts using 1,500,000 Copilot Credits over a year. By purchasing P3 Tier 2 (15,000 CCCUs for $14,100), they receive a 6% discount compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. Throughout the year, agents consume CCCUs from the pre-purchased balance, enabling predictable budgeting even during seasonal usage spikes.

## Key Benefits

- **Cost Savings**: Up to 20% discount with higher tiers.
- **Budget Predictability**: One-time payment secures fixed rates for a full year.
- **Flexibility**: Add or combine P3 with other capacity packs or PAYG at any time.
- **No Redeployment**: Applies automatically to eligible services.
- **Configurable Scope**: Plans can be applied at resource, subscription, management group, or organization-wide levels.

## Purchase Process

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Go to **Reservations** > **+ Add** > **Copilot Credit Pre-purchase Plan**.
3. Select your Azure subscription and scope.
4. Pick your tier and complete payment.
5. Link your subscription to Copilot Studio in the Power Platform Admin Center.

## Best Practices

- **Estimate Carefully**: Use your project’s historical data or the [Copilot consumption estimator](https://microsoft.github.io/copilot-studio-estimator/).
- **Deploy Environments as PAYG-enabled**: Complete environment setup before purchasing.
- **Monitor Usage**: Set up usage alerts to avoid unexpected charges if credits run out.
- **Manage Renewals**: Auto-renew is enabled by default—adjust settings as needed.

## Conclusion

The P3 plan is ideal for organizations scaling their use of Copilot Studio and seeking control over AI project expenses. By pre-purchasing credits, you lock in discounts, avoid surprise bills, and streamline financial operations for your development teams.
