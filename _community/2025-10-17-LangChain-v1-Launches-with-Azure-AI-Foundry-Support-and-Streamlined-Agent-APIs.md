# LangChain v1 Launches with Azure AI Foundry Support and Streamlined Agent APIs

**Author:** mmhangami

LangChain v1 is now officially available, marking a significant milestone for developers building AI agent applications. This release introduces a more opinionated, streamlined, and extensible foundation optimized for agentic Large Language Model (LLM) solutions.

---

## New Features and Redesign Motivation

- **Unified Agent Abstraction:** All previous chains and agent patterns are now replaced by a single, consistent high-level agent, powered internally by the LangGraph runtime.
- **LangGraph as Foundation:** Orchestrates durable, stateful workflows and agent execution.
- **Standardized Message Format:** Upgraded to structured content blocks—enabling richer model output and easier integration across providers.
- **Modularized Package:** Core abstractions for agents, models, messages, and tools are concentrated in the main package, with legacy constructs now maintained under `langchain-classic` for backwards compatibility.

## Key Changes for Developers

### 1. `create_agent` is the New Default API

This is now the preferred way to instantiate agents in v1, replacing prior constructs like `create_react_agent`. The new API is modular, supporting middleware for before/after hooks, error handling, and request manipulation.

### 2. Structured Content Blocks

Responses now include structured pieces such as text, reasoning, citations, and tool calls, instead of opaque strings. This supports better interoperability and advanced client-side use. For backward compatibility, opt-in serialization to string remains possible via `output_version="v1"`.

### 3. Multimodal Model I/O

LangChain v1 supports inputs and outputs beyond text, including files, images, and video—enabling new AI UX paradigms as LLMs become increasingly multimodal.

### 4. Middleware & Execution Context

Middleware can be injected everywhere: before/after model or tool calls, for error recovery, logging, or request transformation. Each agent execution now features a consistently available runtime and context object for better state management.

### 5. Simplified Migration and Namespace

Many older modules have moved to `langchain-classic` to minimize clutter. There is a [dedicated migration guide](http://LangChain%20Docs) to help users upgrade from v0 to v1.

## General Availability Promises

- **Production Ready:** After extensive alpha/beta adoption and testing, v1 is recommended for production deployments.
- **Stable v0 Remains:** Users not ready to migrate can continue using v0, which remains supported with documentation.
- **Versioning and Roadmap:** Breaking changes trigger minor version increments and deprecation alerts. Expect active maintenance and frequent updates.

## Practical Steps for Microsoft Developers

1. **Try LangChain v1 with Azure AI Foundry and Azure OpenAI:**
   - Python: [Azure AI integration](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/azure_ai)
   - JavaScript: [Microsoft integration](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/integrations/providers/microsoft)
   - Both Azure AI and Azure OpenAI are supported from day one.

2. **Join the Live Event:**
   - Microsoft Developer Advocates Marlene Mhangami and Yohan Lasorsa will demonstrate v1 features and answer developer questions. [Register here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/26481/?wt.mc_id=blog_26481_webpage_reactor).
