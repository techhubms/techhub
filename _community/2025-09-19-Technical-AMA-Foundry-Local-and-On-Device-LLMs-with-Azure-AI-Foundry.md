## What You'll Learn

- **Foundry Local Tooling**: A suite of SDKs, CLI tools, and APIs for building and evaluating LLM (Large Language Model) applications directly on your own hardware.
- **On-Device Inference**: Run pre-set or custom AI models locally, reducing cloud dependency, recurring costs, and keeping data secure on-premises.
- **Seamless Cloud Integration**: Quickly scale or migrate local models and pipelines to Azure AI Foundry for broader cloud capabilities.
- **Model Customization**: Tailor models to fit unique requirements directly in your own environment before productionizing.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for edge deployments, environments with limited connectivity, privacy/regulatory constraints, and rapid AI prototyping.

## Event Highlights

- Deep dive demo of Foundry Local CLI and SDK workflows
- Step-by-step examples of local inference, model selection, and prompt engineering
- Best practices to move projects between local/dev and Azure cloud
- Q&A with core Microsoft technical staff, including Maanav Dalal (Product Manager, AI Frameworks)

## Key Features of Foundry Local

- **Performance**: Real-time, low-latency inference on your hardware
- **Privacy**: Keep sensitive data and model artifacts on local infrastructure
- **Cost Savings**: Avoid recurring cloud inference costs by utilizing your own compute
- **Integration**: SDK, REST API, and CLI for embedding into existing AI and app ecosystems

## Why Attend?

- Get actionable knowledge from Microsoft’s engineering team
- Network with other AI developers and practitioners
- Learn practical tips for deploying, customizing, and migrating LLM workloads at the edge and in the cloud
