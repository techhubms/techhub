description: "This community discussion explores how teams can use Azure DevOps Boards to manage both project and operational tasks in a central location. The post addresses scenarios where a Project Management Office (PMO) creates project-focused tasks while technical teams also handle ongoing operational work, aiming for unified visibility and management, including hierarchical team views and API feed integration from ITSM systems."

# Integrating PMO Project and Operational Backlogs with Azure DevOps Boards

**Author: Acrobatic-Lychee3314**

This discussion explores the challenge of unifying project management office (PMO) tasks with operational backlogs for technical teams using Azure DevOps Boards:

## Scenario Overview

- **PMO-Generated Tasks**: Project managers create tasks for various projects, assigning them to technical teams.
- **Operational Backlogs**: Technical teams also field tasks from an ITSM system, covering ongoing operational needs (updates, maintenance, ad-hoc requests).
- **Goal**: Centralize all tasks (project, operational, ad-hoc) for each technical team within a single Azure DevOps Board, while maintaining a project-centric view where appropriate.

## Key Requirements

- **API Integration**: ITSM system can push tasks into Azure DevOps Boards programmatically.
- **Customized Views**: Project managers and team members should have filtered viewsâ€”project managers see project progress, tech team members see all tasks assigned to their team or themselves.
- **Separation of Duties**: Some tasks are only relevant to non-technical project teams and should remain isolated within the project view, not cluttering technical teams' backlogs.

## Solution Referenced

- **Hierarchical Teams in Azure Boards**: Leverages Azure DevOps' support for hierarchical team configurations, allowing different teams to maintain distinct backlogs and boards while rolling up visibility for cross-team coordination.
- **Documentation**: [Configure hierarchical teams in Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/plans/configure-hierarchical-teams?view=azure-devops)

## Discussion Highlights

- **Clarification on Terminology**: The word "project" means the PMO sense (a business project), not the technical 'Project' structure in Azure DevOps.
- **Filtering Views**: Azure Boards can be structured so that:
  - **Project Managers**: Have visibility into all project tasks.
  - **Technical Teams**: See all work (from projects, ITSM, ad-hoc) relevant to their backlog.
  - **Non-Technical Project Team**: Handles their tasks solely in the project view.
- **Implementation**: Team configuration and permission management are key to ensuring the right stakeholders see the right sets of tasks.
- **Flexibility**: The approach supports the addition of ad-hoc tasks and dynamic feeding of work items from multiple origins.

## Practical Tips

- Use Azure DevOps' hierarchical teams to map both project and operational responsibilities.
- Integrate ITSM APIs for automated task creation.
- Leverage board customizations and security/permissions to segment visibility by role and function.
- Review official Microsoft documentation to set up and fine-tune hierarchical teams and filtering.
