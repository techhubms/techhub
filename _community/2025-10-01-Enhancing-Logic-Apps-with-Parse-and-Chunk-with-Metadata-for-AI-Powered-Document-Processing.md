# Enhancing Logic Apps with Parse & Chunk with Metadata for AI-Powered Document Processing

**Author: shahparth**

The Logic Apps team has introduced two powerful new actions—**Parse document with metadata** and **Chunk text with metadata**—to improve document handling workflows. These actions go beyond basic text extraction, capturing rich metadata such as `pageNumber`, `totalPages`, and sentence completeness, enabling more accurate citation and efficient processing for downstream AI workflows.

## Why Metadata Matters

Traditional document parsing actions output raw text, often resulting in fragmented sentences and loss of critical context like page locations. The new metadata-enriched actions ensure that each text chunk:

- Is accompanied by its originating page number (`pageNumber`)
- Includes the total number of pages (`totalPages`)
- Ends on a complete sentence (`sentencesAreComplete`)

This enables precise citation, better navigation, and improved processing reliability for tasks such as contract review, compliance, and knowledge retrieval.

## End-to-End Workflow Walkthrough

### Prerequisites

- Azure Blob Storage: For staging your PDF or document files
- Azure AI Search: With an index to hold embedded and chunked document data
- Azure OpenAI deployment: For embeddings and chat-based Q&A (GPT-4.1 recommended)
- Logic Apps (Standard): To orchestrate the workflow using the new AI actions

A [sample GitHub demo](https://github.com/Azure/logicapps/tree/shahparth-lab-patch-1/ws-vscode) is available to accelerate your setup.

### Step 1: Ingestion Flow

**Objective:** Convert uploaded PDFs into sentence-complete chunks with metadata and index them.

Workflow overview:

- Trigger: When a blob (document) is added or updated in Blob Storage
- Read blob content
- Parse the document, extracting text along with metadata
- Chunk the text, maintaining sentence and page structural boundaries
- Generate vector embeddings for each chunk via Azure OpenAI
- Prepare index objects with text, embedding, and metadata fields
- Batch index these objects into Azure AI Search

This approach ensures each indexed item links back to its source page and position, laying the groundwork for highly accurate retrievals.

### Step 2: Agent Flow with Vector Search

**Objective:** Enable users to ask questions about contracts and receive AI-generated answers with reliable citations.

- Set up a Conversational workflow in Logic Apps
- Configure the Agent action with GPT-4.1, instructing it to use only retrieved, indexed content to answer questions
- Pass chat prompts into an Agent Parameter, which feeds user queries into the Vector Search tool
- The tool retrieves contextually relevant chunks from Azure AI Search (using vector similarity)
- The agent forms a response solely based on these chunks, including page number citations

This architecture ensures answers are always grounded in enterprise documents and traceable to their source.

#### Example Scenario

Whenever a new file is added:

- The ingestion workflow parses, chunks, embeds, and indexes it
- When a user asks, “What is the standard payment timeline?”, the conversational agent:
  - Performs a vector search against the indexed content
  - Extracts the correct chunk (with metadata such as page number)
  - Generates an answer citing the specific contract page

### Step 3: Observability and Validation

- Indexing and Q&A runs are easily traceable in Logic Apps run history, confirming that metadata is attached and responses include proper citations.
- The agent flow remains declarative and easy to debug, with each tool action traceable in the Logic Apps portal.

## Conclusion

The new **Parse & Chunk with Metadata** actions, in tandem with Azure AI Search and Agent Loop workflows, provide a robust foundation for building context-aware, production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions in Microsoft Azure. By bringing metadata into every step, organizations can ensure trustworthy, referenceable answers for enterprise documents with minimal custom code.
