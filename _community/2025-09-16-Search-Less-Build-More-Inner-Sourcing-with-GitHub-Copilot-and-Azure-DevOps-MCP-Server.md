# Search Less, Build More: Inner Sourcing with GitHub Copilot and Azure DevOps MCP Server

Author: **owaino**

## Introduction

Developers often waste time searching through scattered repositories, wikis, and chats to find standards or code examples. In large organizations, this leads to lost productivity and underused internal resources. This article explains how combining **GitHub Copilot** with the **Azure DevOps (ADO) MCP server** (and the free `code_search` extension) transforms the IDE into a powerful discovery hub for organizational knowledge.

## The Challenge of Knowledge Discovery

Developers need to quickly locate reusable code, organizational standards, and best practices. Traditional tools like Backstage improve discoverability but often require significant effort to keep resources up-to-date and reusable. Copilot, when paired with Azure DevOps MCP server, addresses this by:

- Letting Copilot reference organizational resources (projects, repos, wikis, work items)
- Automatically searching across repositories and documentation
- Generating code snippets anchored in real code or standards

## What Is the Azure DevOps MCP Server and code_search Extension?

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard letting agents like Copilot pull in custom organizational context.
- The **Azure DevOps MCP Server** implements this standard, exposing projects, repos, work items, and wiki content for on-demand consumption in Copilot.
- The **code_search extension** enables deep, cross-repository search of code, supporting queries for symbols, snippets, and implementation examples.

Together, these tools allow Copilot to ground its responses in real, live ADO content—protecting sensitive information by running locally and respecting ADO permissions.

## Using Copilot Instructions

One powerful way to customize Copilot's behavior is through **instructions files**. These allow organizations or developers to specify:

- When and where Copilot should search (e.g., always check repos and wikis first)
- How Copilot should cite sources and resolve conflicts
- How specific scenarios (e.g., work items, code reviews) should be handled

**Example snippet from personal Copilot instructions:**

```markdown
# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Azure DevOps MCP Integration

This project uses Azure DevOps with MCP server integration to provide organizational context awareness.
Always check to see if the Azure DevOps MCP server has a tool relevant to the user's request.

## Core Principles

1. Always prioritize Azure DevOps MCP tools for project management, code reviews, builds, deployments, and documentation.
2. Reference existing standards, shared libraries, and ADRs in wikis.
3. Cite specific sources for code suggestions.
```

## Demo: Implementation Steps

1. **Enable code_search** in your Azure DevOps organization (Marketplace extension).
2. **Login to Azure** with `az login`.
3. **Create `.vscode/mcp.json`** to define MCP server configuration.
4. **Start the MCP server** and grant Copilot access.
5. **Add Copilot Instructions file** with organizational search logic.
6. **Experiment with prompts** to validate workspace discovery.

**Setup guide available:** [azure-devops-mcp/docs/GETTINGSTARTED.md](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/blob/main/docs/GETTINGSTARTED.md)

## Practical Considerations

- **Latency:** Using MCP tooling can cause some latency; optimize Copilot usage as needed.
- **Repo Complexity:** Test performance in environments with many complex or large repositories.
- **Public Preview:** MCP Server is evolving rapidly and currently in public preview.

## Results and Impact

- Copilot leverages all available documentation, code, and standards to surface relevant examples and enforce conventions.
- Using real prompts, the demo showed Copilot referencing README content and standards from across multiple ADO projects.

## Best Practices

- Always structure documentation and code with discoverability in mind (README, wikis, and good comments).
- Use organizational Copilot instructions to standardize search and suggestion patterns.
- Monitor latency and tweak server/instructions as environments grow.

Adopting this approach enables developers to "search less and build more"—reusing knowledge at scale and supporting platform engineering objectives.
