# Async/Await - Beyond the Basics in .NET

Delicious_Jaguar_341 kicks off a community discussion centered on performance issues related to the sync-over-async pattern in .NET applications. The conversation draws on real-world debugging experiences and delves into the nuanced mistakes that are common among developers working with asynchronous code.

## Key Points Covered

- **Sync-over-Async Problems**: Real-world performance issues can arise from blocking asynchronous calls using patterns like `DoSomethingAsync().Result` and `DoSomethingAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult()`. These techniques block threads and limit scalability, offering poor alternatives to proper async code execution.
- **Why It's Frowned Upon**: Both patterns introduce thread-blocking by turning asynchronous operations into synchronous ones, which can overwhelm thread pools and slow down I/O-bound applications.
- **Proper Practices**: Developers are encouraged to refactor top-level code to be fully async when possible, rather than wrapping async calls in synchronous wrappers. This sometimes means overcoming API or GUI framework limitations.
- **Events and GUI Frameworks**: Event handlers in GUI frameworks often require special handling since they natively support only synchronous operations. The discussion highlights why `async void` is typically discouraged, but sometimes necessary for event handlers, and advises on mitigation strategies.
- **Further Resources**: The thread references a detailed Medium article for in-depth explanations and code samples: [Do you really understand async/await?](https://medium.com/@ashishbhagwani/do-you-really-understand-async-await-d583586a476d)
- **Community Feedback and Insights**: Participants share observations about the 'viral' nature of async, attempts to shortcut learning, and the need for deep understanding to write effective asynchronous .NET code.

## Example Code Snippets

```csharp
// Bad Practices
var result = DoSomethingAsync().Result;
var result = DoSomethingAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();

// Preferred Approach
async Task DoWorkAsync() {
    var result = await DoSomethingAsync();
    // Handle result
}
```

## Additional Observations

- Many developers internalize syntax but miss the underlying mechanics (e.g., state machine transformation, thread usage).
- Misapplication of async/await, especially when integrating with legacy synchronous APIs or certain UI components, is extremely common.
- Deep dives into .NET's ThreadPool and differentiation between worker and IOCP threads are teased for future discussions.

## Takeaways

Developers should resist 'making async code synchronous,' understand when and why to use `async void`, and strive to propagate async through their application layers. Community discussion and educational resources like this help bridge knowledge gaps and improve code quality.
