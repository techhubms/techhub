# From Call Transcripts to CRM Gold: AI-Powered Post-Call Intelligence

This article describes a workflow created by seankeegan for transforming raw customer call transcripts into actionable CRM records, powered by Azure Communication Services and Azure OpenAI.

## The Problem: Business Intelligence Locked in Transcripts

- Critical details from customer calls are often lost in transcript files, leaving CRM records incomplete.
- Manual note-taking during calls is error-prone and leads to missed follow-ups or escalation signals.

## Solution Overview

A five-step process automates extraction and structuring of key call data:

1. **Capture call transcripts** using Azure Communication Services Call Automation APIs or Microsoft Teams APIs.
2. **AI processes the transcript** to extract sentiment, next steps, follow-ups, and patterns using Azure OpenAI.
3. **Human-in-the-loop review** allows agents to validate and adjust AI findings for accuracy and nuanced business context.
4. **Structured output**: AI delivers results in a strict JSON schema, ensuring integration with CRM systems is reliable and consistent.
5. **Immediate business actions**: Use the intelligence for follow-up alerts, product feedback loops, or sales enablement.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Frontend:** JavaScript (vanilla)
- **AI Provider:** Azure OpenAI (using structured, schema-driven outputs)
- **CRMs:** Any (integration via JSON APIs)

## Key Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Automates data entry from calls, saving agent hours.
- **Data Consistency**: JSON schema guarantees consistent format for CRM ingest; no custom parsing needed.
- **Business Impact**: Early detection of customer escalation, product issues, or sales opportunities.
- **Human Oversight**: Agents verify and refine AI output, ensuring records capture real business context.

## Demo & Getting Started

- Clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/seanryankeegan/post-call-intelligence)
- Install dependencies and configure Azure OpenAI credentials.
- Test scenarios such as customer billing or technical support.
- See the workflow in action, including AI extraction, manual review, and CRM-ready output.

## Integration Advice

- Use [Azure Communication Services Call Automation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/how-tos/call-automation/real-time-transcription-tutorial?pivots=programming-language-javascript) or Microsoft Teams APIs to obtain real-time or recorded call transcripts.
- The workflow remains the same whether using live or batch transcripts.
- Asynchronous processing (queueing transcripts for background analysis) is recommended for production setups.

## Considerations

- Not all LLMs support robust structured outputs; Azure OpenAI is highlighted for this capability.
- Human review is critical for accuracyâ€”AI handles structure and patterns, people handle nuance and business judgment.
- The solution is scalable: works for small teams or large-scale enterprise operations.

## Resources

- [Real-time transcription docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/how-tos/call-automation/real-time-transcription-tutorial?pivots=programming-language-javascript)
- [Azure Communication Services Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples)

## Conclusion

By combining Azure Communication Services, Azure OpenAI, simple web technologies, and human review, organizations can unlock actionable insights from call transcripts and ensure CRM records capture the full story of customer interactions.
