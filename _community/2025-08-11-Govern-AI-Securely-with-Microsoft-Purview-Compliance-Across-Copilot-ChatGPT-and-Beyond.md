# Govern AI Securely. Purview Empowers Compliance Across Copilot, ChatGPT, and Beyond!

**Author:** Jacques_GuibertDeBruet

## Introduction

AI is reshaping enterprise operations, but with innovation comes the imperative of robust data protection. Drawing on years of experience with Azure Information Protection and Data Loss Prevention, the author demonstrates how Microsoft Purview and its Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI can help organizations effectively govern AI tools—both Microsoft and third-party—while safeguarding compliance and reducing risk.

---

## The Challenge: AI and Sensitive Data

- AI agents increasingly interact with regulated or sensitive data via natural language prompts.
- Consumer-grade AI apps (e.g., ChatGPT, DeepSeek) often bypass enterprise security controls, exposing data to regulatory and confidentiality risks.

## Why Now? Enterprise Urgency

- By 2025, over half of enterprises expect users to adopt personal AI apps at work, increasing risks of data oversharing and compliance violations.

---

## Core Use Cases

- **Governance:** Apply unified security/compliance policies across Microsoft and third-party AI services.
- **Auditing:** Capture audit logs for AI interactions to meet regulatory needs.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Block or adaptively protect sensitive uploads/prompts with real-time user behavior context.
