## GitHub UI Bug: “Commit changes” Button Active During File Upload

**Author: Abey_lawda_ka_reddit**

### Issue Overview

When uploading files to a GitHub repository using the `Add file → Upload files` interface, the “Commit changes” button remains enabled—even if files are still uploading. This behavior allows users to click the button prematurely.

#### Impacts

- **HTTP 400 errors**: Submitting a commit before uploads complete can lead to server errors.
- **Incomplete commits**: Not all selected files are included in the commit if uploads are interrupted.
- **User confusion**: Users may not understand why their files were not properly committed.

### Suggested Solution

The author recommends a simple fix: **disable the “Commit changes” button until all file uploads have completed**. This would prevent accidental incomplete commits and related errors, improving user experience.

### Community Request

The author previously raised the issue in a [GitHub community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/165732) but hasn’t received a response. They encourage others to:

- Upvote or share feedback on the discussion to increase visibility.
- Share thoughts if they have encountered the same issue.

### Conclusion

More community feedback may help bring this issue to the attention of GitHub’s development team, leading to a fix enhancing the overall workflow for file uploads.
