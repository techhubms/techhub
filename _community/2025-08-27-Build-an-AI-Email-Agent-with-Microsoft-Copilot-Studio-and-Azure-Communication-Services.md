# Build an AI Email Agent with Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure Communication Services

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a custom AI email assistant leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure Communication Services. This solution integrates cloud-based email capabilities in an AI agent that can be deployed across platforms, including M365, Teams, and the web.

## Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio license**
- **Azure subscription**
- **Basic familiarity with Python (for Azure Function development)**
- **Visual Studio Code** (with Azure Functions and Azure Resources extensions recommended)

## 1. Create Your Agent in Copilot Studio

1. Go to [Copilot Studio](http://copilotstudio.microsoft.com).
2. Use the prompt to describe your agent, e.g., "I want to create an agent that can send out emails using Azure communication services."
3. Configure your agent’s name and description.
4. Click Create to set up the environment.

## 2. Set Up Email Services in Azure

1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com/).
2. Search for **Communication Services** in the marketplace and create a resource.
3. Create an **Email Communication Services** resource for email functionality. [Detailed guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=unix&pivots=platform-azp)
4. Retrieve your sender address (e.g., DoNotReply@yourdomain).

## 3. Integrate with Azure Function

1. In Azure Portal, create a new **Function App**. Select Python as the runtime.
2. Write a Python script to:
    - Receive request data (recipient, subject, body)
    - Connect to Azure Communication Services
    - Send the email
    - Example code and templates are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/farhanhussainleo/ai-email-agent)
3. Deploy your function and get the Function App URL.
4. In the function's settings, add environment variables for connection strings and sender address:
    - `ACS_CONNECTION_STRING`
    - `ACS_SENDER_EMAIL`

## 4. Design Conversation Flow in Copilot Studio

1. In Copilot Studio, go to the **Topics** tab, add a new topic from blank.
2. Set trigger phrases (e.g., "send an email").
3. Add questions for recipient, subject, and body. Store responses in variables (`varRecipient`, `varSubject`, `varBody`).
4. Optionally, personalize by collecting the recipient's name.

## 5. Connect to Azure Function via HTTP Request

1. Add an **HTTP Request** node after user input collection.
2. Set the URL (Function App endpoint), method (POST), and JSON body to match your function’s expected schema.
3. Save the function response to a variable for success handling.

## 6. Test and Publish

1. Use the Copilot Studio test panel to simulate conversations.
2. Follow prompts, submit an email, and verify delivery.
3. Address any user prompt or loop issues via studio settings (disable generative orchestration, ensure topic ends after success message).
4. Publish your agent and deploy it to channels such as Teams, web, or Facebook.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Unnecessary prompts?** Disable generative AI orchestration in agent settings.
- **Agent loops?** Explicitly end topic with `Topic management → End` after the success response. Optionally, check `varSendResult.ok == true` and confirm delivery before ending.
