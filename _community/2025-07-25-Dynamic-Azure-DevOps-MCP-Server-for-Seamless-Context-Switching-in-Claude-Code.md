OkAdministration2514 details how they built a dynamic MCP server that empowers Claude Code users to seamlessly switch Azure DevOps contexts by project directory, offering robust DevOps automation for multi-client work.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Dynamic Azure DevOps MCP Server for Seamless Context Switching in Claude Code

**Author:** OkAdministration2514

## TL;DR

Created a custom MCP server enabling Claude Code users to work across multiple Azure DevOps projects without manual re-authentication. The tool leverages smart directory detection and local config files to auto-switch contexts, significantly improving multi-client DevOps workflows.

## The Problem

When using Claude Code with Azure DevOps, developers working on multiple projects encounter static authentication limitationsâ€”typically restricted to a single Azure DevOps org or project at a time due to environment variable settings. Switching between projects requires restarts and config changes, causing workflow interruptions.

## The Solution: Dynamic Context Switching

The solution is `u/wangkanai/devops-mcp`, an MCP server that:

- Detects the active project directory automatically
- Uses project-specific `.azure-devops.json` files to store organization and PAT credentials
- Switches Azure DevOps authentication contexts instantly as you move directories, with no manual config edits or restarts required

### Key Features

- **Zero-Configuration Directory Switching:**
  - Simply changing directories updates your Azure DevOps context automatically
- **Comprehensive DevOps Tooling (8 total):**
  - Work item management (create/query with full metadata)
  - Repository and build management
  - Pipeline triggering/monitoring
  - Pull request operations
  - Dynamic context reporting
- **Security Focus:**
  - PAT tokens stored locally only
  - Credentials never committed to git
  - Credential isolation per project
  - Compliant with GitHub secret scanning policies

### How It Works

1. Each project directory contains a `.azure-devops.json` file with organization-specific credentials and metadata.
2. The MCP server detects directory changes and loads context from the respective config file.
3. Authentication is switched on-the-fly without restarts, maintaining a seamless workflow across multiple clients or projects.

#### Example Directory Usage

```bash
cd ~/projects/company-a   # Switches to Company A's Azure DevOps context
cd ~/projects/company-b   # Switches to Company B's Azure DevOps context
```

#### Example Config File (.azure-devops.json)

```json
{
  "organizationUrl": "https://dev.azure.com/your-org",
  "project": "YourProject",
  "pat": "your-pat-token",
  "description": "Project-specific Azure DevOps config"
}
```

### Installation

Quick setup via Claude Code:

```sh
claude mcp add devops-mcp -- npx u/wangkanai/devops-mcp
```

Add a `.azure-devops.json` for each project as shown above.

### Real-World Impact

- **90% Time Reduction** in context switching
- **Zero Authentication Errors** when moving between projects
- **Simplified Consulting and Multi-client Workflows**
- **Enhanced Security**: Credential isolation, local-only storage

### Tech Stack & Metrics

- **Node.js + TypeScript** with MCP SDK
- **>95% Test Coverage**
- **Sub-200ms Context Switching Overhead**
- **Production Ready**: Robust error handling & fallbacks

### Why This Matters for DevOps

This approach removes one of the main productivity bottlenecks in multi-organizational DevOps work, making context switching transparent and secure. Especially valuable for consultants and developers managing numerous client projects.
