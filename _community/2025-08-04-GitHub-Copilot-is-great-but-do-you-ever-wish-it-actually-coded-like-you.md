## Exploring the Limits of GitHub Copilot and Personalized Code Assistants

**Author: Comfortable-Fish690**

I've been exploring a side project that’s inspired by the limitations I’ve felt while using Copilot.

GitHub Copilot is effective at completing code, yet it often misses the nuances of how I personally approach programming. It doesn't truly *think* like me—failing to reflect my unique problem-solving style, my sometimes messy but effective structures, or the little quirks and habits I've developed over time.

### The Idea: An Agent That Learns Your Style

This realization led me to start building something new: an agent that learns how *you* code, aiming to assist in solving problems the way *you* would—even when you're tired or lacking motivation. The goal is a tool that adapts to your methods and preferences, providing suggestions and solutions that feel as if you wrote them yourself.

### Looking for Community Insights

To better understand Copilot's pain points for real developers, I’d like your input:

- What is the most frustrating aspect of using Copilot or other AI tools?
- Would you want an assistant that actually codes *like you*, rather than just filling in code blanks?

This isn't a pitch for a product, but a request for honest experiences, feedback, and discussion around where Copilot falls short and how a more personalized approach might help developers.
