06Hexagram initiates a discussion about overlaying strings in C# console apps without overwriting non-space characters, with community members contributing practical solutions.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Overlaying Strings in C# Console Applications Without Clearing Characters

**Author:** 06Hexagram and community contributors

## Problem Statement

You have a console app and want to output a string containing spaces so that the spaces do *not* overwrite existing screen content. For example, overlaying `"* * *"` on top of `"ABCDEFG"` should result in `"*BC*EF*"` instead of having spaces overwrite background characters.

## Key Challenges

- Directly writing spaces (`' '`) to the console clears whatever character is already at that position.
- No standard "non-printable space" in ASCII acts as a transparent overlay.

## Solutions and Suggestions

### 1. **Manual Character-by-Character Overlay**

Community members suggest looping over both strings and writing only non-space characters:

```csharp
public static class ConsoleEx {
    /// <summary>
    /// Writes the characters of another string over the current
    /// string when the characters of the other string are not a space
    /// </summary>
    public static void Overwrite(string a, string b) {
        int max = Math.Max(a.Length, b.Length);
        for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) {
            Console.Write(
                i >= b.Length ? a[i] : (b[i] == ' ' && i < a.Length ? a[i] : b[i])
            );
        }
    }
}

// Usage:
ConsoleEx.Overwrite("ABCDEFG", "* * *");
// Output: *BC*EF*
```

### 2. **ANSI Escape Sequences for Cursor Movement**

To skip spaces, use ANSI escape codes to move the cursor forward:

```csharp
Console.Write("*\x1b[2C*\x1b[2C*");
```

- `\x1b[2C` moves the cursor right by 2 columns.
- This can skip writing spaces, but care is needed regarding existing characters and runtime behavior.

### 3. **Using Spectre.Console or a Custom Buffer**

- Libraries like [Spectre.Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) provide more advanced control for overlaying, colors, and screen manipulation.
- Alternatively, maintaining your own "screen buffer" in memory and writing only the changed characters can produce the most predictable results, especially for complex overlays.

### 4. **Extension Methods for Overlay**

Sample string extension for overlaying:

```csharp
public static string Overwrite(this string a, string b) {
    int len = Math.Max(a.Length, b.Length);
    var result = new char[len];
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        result[i] = (i < b.Length && b[i] != ' ') ? b[i] : (i < a.Length ? a[i] : ' ');
    }
    return new string(result);
}

// Usage: var output = "ABCDEFG".Overwrite("* *");
```

## Takeaways

- There is no special "transparent space" character for console applications.
- Overlaying requires conditional logic: only output non-space characters, or use escape sequences to skip positions.
- For high control over display (colors, overlays), use advanced libraries or manage your own buffer.

**Pro Tip:** Direct string manipulation is often necessary, but for real-time graphics and overlays, consider a UI library or direct buffer management for scalability.
