maverick-1009 explains a practical approach to consolidating Logic App conditions using C# Inline Code to streamline Azure workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

## How I Replaced 10 Logic App Conditions with 1 C# Script

In this post, maverick-1009 describes how manual workflow logic in Azure Logic Apps can quickly become unwieldy, especially when using several "Condition" blocks. Chaining many conditions not only complicates the workflow's structure but can also make maintenance more difficult.

To address these issues, the author introduces the use of the Inline Code (C#) action within Logic Apps. By writing a short piece of C# code directly inside the Logic App, multiple conditions can be evaluated at once, replacing the need for multiple sequential conditional blocks.

### Benefits Highlighted

- **Simplification**: Multiple logical conditions are consolidated into a single C# script, making the workflow easier to read and maintain.
- **Performance**: Unlike traditional Azure Functions, Inline Code actions do not have cold start times or introduce HTTP latency, delivering immediate execution within the workflow.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminates the need for external triggers and reduces the number of steps in the workflow design.

### Example Use Case

Instead of a Logic App with ten "Condition" actions, a single Inline Code (C#) block evaluates all necessary logic, acts as a filter, or determines workflow paths.

### Summary

This approach is recommended for anyone looking to optimize and simplify their Azure Logic Apps workflows while avoiding the overhead of Azure Functions and reducing execution latency.
