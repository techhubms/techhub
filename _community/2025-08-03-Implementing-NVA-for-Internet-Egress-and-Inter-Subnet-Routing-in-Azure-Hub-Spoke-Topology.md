title: "Implementing NVA for Internet Egress and Inter-Subnet Routing in Azure Hub-Spoke Topology"
description: "The author seeks advice on configuring an NVA (Network Virtual Appliance) in an Azure hub-spoke network to direct all internet-bound and inter-subnet traffic from spoke VMs through the NVA, replacing the existing VPN gateway. The discussion focuses on route table configurations, UDRs, peering settings, and preserving future architectural flexibility."

HDClown discusses the integration of a Network Virtual Appliance into an Azure hub-spoke architecture and seeks advice on achieving internet egress and inter-subnet routing through the NVA.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Scenario Overview

**Current Network Topology:**

- 2 vNets: one hub, one spoke.
- Hub vNet: Contains subnet for VPN gateway, now also two subnets for NVA (WAN/LAN), Public IP on WAN NIC.
- Spoke vNet: Three subnets, VMs in each.
- vNet peering configured (detailed peering settings).
- VPN gateway provides on-prem S2S, Azure Load Balancer previously served internet egress for spoke VMs.
- Initially, no User Defined Routes (UDRs).

**Goal:**

1. All Azure VMs in the spoke vNet should egress to internet via the NVA.
2. All inter-subnet routing in the spoke vNet should flow via the NVA.
3. NVA replaces the VPN gateway for on-prem connections (S2S).

**NVA Details:**

- Cato Networks SASE solution deployed in the hub vNet, two subnets (WAN and LAN), LAN subnet used for routing.
- UDRs with 0.0.0.0/0 → NVA LAN IP for LAN subnet and spoke subnets.

## Steps Already Taken

- Created and associated a route table (UDR 0.0.0.0/0 → NVA LAN IP) to all spoke subnet(s).
- Removed the spoke VMs from Azure Load Balancer’s backend pool.
- Verified that internet egress for spoke VMs now flows through NVA.
- Inter-subnet traffic within the spoke is still NOT routed via the NVA — Azure platform routing prevails for intra-vNet traffic due to default system routes.

## Technical Analysis

### Why Inter-Subnet Routing is Bypassing Your NVA

- **Azure’s System Routes:** For traffic within the same vNet (including between subnets), Azure uses default system routes, bypassing UDRs unless an explicit, more specific route is configured.
- Your default UDR (0.0.0.0/0) is less specific than the system routes (which cover each subnet’s address range).

### Solutions

**1. Add Explicit UDRs for Each Spoke Subnet:**  

- Create a UDR in each spoke subnet's route table targeting every other subnet's address range, setting the next hop to the NVA's LAN IP.
- Example: If spoke subnets are 10.1.1.0/24, 10.1.2.0/24, and 10.1.3.0/24, in 10.1.1.0/24’s route table, add:
  - Destination: 10.1.2.0/24 → Next hop: NVA LAN IP
  - Destination: 10.1.3.0/24 → Next hop: NVA LAN IP
  - Repeat similarly for the other subnets.
- This will force east-west traffic through the NVA.

**2. Considerations for VNet Peering:**

- Typically, keep peering. If you route all spoke traffic via NVA, ensure:
  - Peering allows forwarded traffic.
  - UDRs do not create routing conflicts or black holes (test S2S/on-prem/vNet-to-vNet flows).
- You may not need to change peering checkboxes if you maintain required traffic flows (especially for any planned future cross-vNet or service integration).

**3. Flexibility for Future Changes:**

- By using UDRs, you retain the ability to selectively bypass the NVA in future — simply add/removing specific routes as necessary for new resources or flows.
- You can even use route tables with subnet-level scope for granular control.

### Other Notes

- Be cautious with Azure platform managed services (such as PaaS) as some may not work as expected with forced tunneling.
- For on-prem S2S, update on-prem routes to point to new NVA public IP, and confirm IPsec/BGP setup with Cato NVA.
- Make sure NSGs (Network Security Groups) are updated to permit flows between subnets/NVA/internet as intended.

## Summary of Recommendations

1. Add subnet-specific UDRs in each spoke subnet route table with the NVA’s LAN IP as the next hop for all other subnet ranges.
2. Confirm and test the resulting flows — both east-west (spoke inter-subnet) and north-south (internet/on-prem traffic).
3. Maintain your hub-spoke peering (with current settings) unless you find specific reasons to change after testing.
4. Document your routing for future flexibility, especially if new resources or services will be provisioned.

Azure networking can be nuanced. Explicit UDRs will give you the controlled traffic flows you seek via your NVA without sacrificing topology flexibility.
