### Overview

Termix, a terminal-based file navigator built with .NET, has reached version 0.9.0. In this community post, amrohann outlines the key new features, enhancements, and ongoing areas for feedback as the project moves toward version 1.0.

### Key New Features

- **File Operations via Keyboard:** Users can now perform rename, delete, and write operations directly from the terminal using keyboard shortcuts.
- **Fuzzy Search (Preview):** A new experimental feature allows live-filtered file navigation for faster file access. As it's in preview, the author requests community feedback and bug reports.
- **No Icons Option:** By launching Termix with `termix --no-icons`, users can fall back to a non-icon interface if necessary (e.g., if icon libraries are unavailable on their system).

### Improvements and Fixes

- **Performance Tweaks:** Various optimizations enhance speed and responsiveness.
- **Key-Binding UX:** User experience related to custom and default key bindings is improved.
- **Bug Fixes:** Stability and reliability have been addressed through multiple bug fixes.
