Creative-Paper1007 discusses building a Visual Studio extension to add native-like git worktree support, making it easier for developers to manage multiple branches without leaving their IDE.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Visual Studio Has Most Git Features I Need—Except Worktree, So I Built an Extension for It

**Author: Creative-Paper1007**

### Introduction

Git worktree is a lesser-known, yet highly useful, feature that allows developers to work on multiple branches simultaneously without disrupting the main repository. Despite its usefulness, it's rarely discussed in mainstream developer conversations.

### The Problem

Many Visual Studio users, including the author, are frustrated by the lack of built-in support for git worktree. Switching between branches in Visual Studio often involves losing context, stashing work, or using external tools—slowing down workflow and reducing productivity.

#### Common Options and Limitations

- **Git Bash or Terminal:** Cumbersome due to the need to manually type full branch names and commands each time.
- **Heavy Third-party GUIs:** Often require installing additional software or their own Git clients, adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Existing Extensions:** Some, like Git Extensions, demand separate Git client installations and offer a steeper learning curve.

### The Solution: Custom Git Worktree Extension

To address these issues, Creative-Paper1007 built a dedicated Git Worktree extension for **Visual Studio 2022** using **.NET**, **C#**, and the Visual Studio extensibility SDK.

#### Key Features

- **Create Worktrees for Any Branch:** Easily spin up new working directories from any branch within the IDE.
- **Switch Between Worktrees:** Move context between multiple active branches without leaving Visual Studio.
- **Manage Branches Side by Side:** Handle parallel development tasks efficiently.
- **No Extra Git Installation:** Utilizes Visual Studio’s built-in Git support; no command line or third-party installs needed.
- **Fully Integrated:** All features are accessible via the familiar Visual Studio interface.

### User Experience

Initially developed for personal use, the extension has since been adopted by the author’s team, becoming a daily staple. Its lightweight, integrated approach contrasts with the complexity and bloat of alternative solutions.

### Visual Studio Extension Ecosystem

Unlike the fast-evolving VS Code extension landscape, Visual Studio’s ecosystem is more restrained, meaning this extension fills a much-needed functional gap for developers used to working within this IDE.

### Conclusion

If you manage multiple branches in parallel and struggle with the limitations of branch switching in Visual Studio, this extension could save time and mental effort by bringing worktree management in-app.
