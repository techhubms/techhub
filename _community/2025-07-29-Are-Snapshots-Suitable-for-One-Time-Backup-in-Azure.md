Izual_Rebirth explores whether Azure snapshots are a practical solution for a one-off backup of an inactive, archival VM, drawing comparisons to on-premises environments.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Are Snapshots Suitable for a One Time Backup Option in Azure?

**Author: Izual_Rebirth**

### Background

The author expresses skepticism about using snapshots as a long-term backup solution for on-premises environments. However, they highlight that Azure snapshots are described as copies of the entire disk, prompting the question of suitability for a single, archival backup.

### Use Case

- **Scenario**: A virtual machine (VM) in Azure is rarely powered on, sees no ongoing changes, and serves only as an archive.
- **Question**: Is an Azure snapshot a fitting choice for a one-time backup in this case?

### Considerations

- **On-Premises Snapshots**: Generally discouraged for long-term use due to reliability or storage concerns.
- **Azure Snapshots**: Marketed as full-disk copies, potentially more robust for backups, at least as a point-in-time image for recovery or archival.
- **Backup Requirements**: Since the VM remains mostly inactive, the risks associated with snapshotting an active, changing system do not apply.
- **Cost and Accessibility**: Snapshots in Azure incur costs and are stored independently, allowing restoration or retention without keeping the VM active.

### Conclusion

Given the scenario—a VM used for archival, with no ongoing changes—a single Azure snapshot could be a practical and cost-effective backup solution.
