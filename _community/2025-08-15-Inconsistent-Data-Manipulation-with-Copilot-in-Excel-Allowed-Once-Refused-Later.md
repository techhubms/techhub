title: "Inconsistent Data Manipulation with Copilot in Excel: Allowed Once, Refused Later"
description: "A user describes an inconsistent experience with Copilot in Excel. On their first use, Copilot successfully performed direct data manipulation—sorting permissions in columns within each row by the permission name. On a subsequent attempt, using the same pattern but a different worksheet, Copilot refused to perform the sort, instead offering guidance. The user seeks an explanation for this change in behavior."

zivrivkis describes a case where Copilot in Excel was able to sort permission columns automatically on the first attempt, but refused to do so on a second, similar worksheet—prompting questions about the tool’s inconsistent capabilities and underlying technical constraints.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Copilot in Excel Performs Data Manipulation Once, Then Refuses Subsequent Requests

**User Experience:**

- The author attempts to sort columns within rows in Excel using Copilot.

-

  1. **First Prompt:**
     - On "Sheet1", asked Copilot to sort each permission column in alphabetical order within each row.
     - Copilot analyzed cell range A1:CE200 and listed 66 changes to be made (custom sorts on multiple columns).
     - On "Apply", Copilot executed the sorts, altering the worksheet as requested.
  2. **Second Attempt:**
     - On a new sheet with an identical structure but different data, a similar sorting request was made.
     - Copilot declined direct action, instead offering only guidance (Power Query steps or formula-based approach).

**Copilot's Explanation (Second Attempt):**
> "I can’t perform the sorting directly for you, but I can guide you step-by-step to sort the Permission1 to Permission34 columns within each row in Table3 on the 'Medium' sheet, just like before... As Excel Copilot, I provide formulas, Power Query steps, or instructions, but I don’t directly manipulate your worksheet. You’ll need to follow the steps I provide in Excel to achieve the result."

## Why the Inconsistent Copilot Behavior?

This experience points to a real-world edge case in Copilot for Excel’s current capabilities and permission model. Here are some likely technical and product factors involved:

- **Experimental and Gradual Feature Release:**
  - Copilot’s ability to manipulate data directly may be gated by feature flag, region, or account permissions. You may have temporarily been in a testing group where full automation was enabled.
  - Microsoft sometimes rolls features out on a rolling basis or A/B test access, so what worked in one session or sheet may be disabled later.

- **Context Sensitivity:**
  - Certain actions may only be allowed under specific circumstances—on the default "Sheet1", on new tables, or with certain triggers.
  - If Copilot recognizes a table (e.g., "Table1" vs. "Table3"), it might lock down manipulation on anything but default/test tables or structures it evaluated as 'safe.'

- **Session and State:**
  - The original successful manipulation might have required particular session conditions—administrator rights, workspace trust, or network connectivity.
  - If your Excel session, permissions, or Copilot’s underlying policies changed (locally or Microsoft-side), capabilities may become restricted.

- **Product Safeguards and Strategy:**
  - Microsoft may intentionally restrict Copilot from automating actions that affect a user’s worksheet to prevent data corruption, unintended changes, or compliance issues.
  - After experimentation, the feature may have shifted to “instructions only” pending more feedback or QA.

- **Potential Bug/Glitch:**
  - Copilot might have performed the direct manipulation erroneously the first time, before logic or safety mechanisms activated.

### Summary Table

| Attempt | Sheet/Table      | Copilot Response       | Result                      |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1st     | Sheet1/Table1    | Direct manipulation    | Data was sorted             |
| 2nd     | Medium/Table3    | Instructional guidance | No direct data manipulation |

## Recommendations & Takeaway

- **Expect Guidance, Not Automation:** As of early/mid 2024, Copilot for Excel is generally designed to guide rather than directly alter data—except for a limited test set or feature flags.
- **Power Query Is Reliable:** For repeated data manipulation tasks, consider Power Query (as Copilot suggested) or creating Excel macros.
- **Check Release Notes:** Look out for Microsoft’s Copilot release notes and documentation for changes in capabilities and feature roll-outs.
- **Feedback Loop:** Sharing such inconsistent experiences in Microsoft’s feedback forms or forums may help clarify the issue, and could even influence how the feature is refined.

**Key Insight:**
> Copilot's ability to manipulate worksheet data may depend on a mix of experimental features, your account/session context, and evolving safety measures. While you experienced full automation once, official behavior may now limit Copilot to guidance and formula suggestions only.
