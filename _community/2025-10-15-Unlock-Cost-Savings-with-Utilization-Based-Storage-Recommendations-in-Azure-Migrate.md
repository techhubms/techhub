# Unlock Cost Savings with Utilization-Based Storage Recommendations in Azure Migrate

**Author:** ankitsurkar

Azure Migrate now introduces a significant new feature: storage utilization-based recommendations. This enhancement allows organizations to optimize cloud migration costs by focusing on **actual storage usage** rather than allocated capacity, leading to better right-sizing and more efficient spending.

---

## Why This Matters

- Analysis across thousands of on-premises environments found that nearly **40% of allocated storage is overprovisioned**.
- Many customers pay for capacity they don't use, as traditional assessments rely on allocated—not utilized—storage.
- This leads to inflated migration cost projections and inefficient resource planning.

## What's New

Azure Migrate now calculates:

- **Assessment recommendations** for right-sizing storage workloads,
- **Business case calculations** for accurate cost projections,

based on **actual storage utilization**.

### Benefits include

- **Lower projected Azure costs:** You pay for only what is used.
- **Optimized cloud footprint:** Eliminates unnecessary storage allocation.
- **Faster ROI:** More accurate business cases accelerate decision-making.

## Customer Impact Example

If an organization finds 40% of their storage overprovisioned, the feature can significantly decrease migration cost estimates, freeing up budget for innovation and other business priorities.

## How to Get Started

1. Deploy an appliance in your on-premises environment.
2. Build your business case or create an Azure Migrate Assessment for on-premises workloads.
3. Review utilization-based recommendations in the generated report or case.

## Additional Resources

For detailed instructions, check the [Azure Migrate documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/target-right-sizing?view=migrate#performance-data-used-for-right-sizing).

## Summary

This update to Azure Migrate arms businesses with precise, actionable insights to streamline cloud migrations, achieve cost savings, and improve their cloud ROI by aligning spending with real storage usage.
