# Accelerating Infrastructure as Code: New Terraform Enhancements for Azure

## Overview

The Terraform on Azure Product Group has introduced new features designed to streamline how infrastructure is built and managed with Terraform on Azure. These enhancements center around improved accessibility, AI integration, and bridging management across Microsoft services.

## Seamless Code Generation to Deployment with Copilot in Azure

- **Integrated Workflow:** Users can now start building Terraform configurations directly in the Azure portal with Copilot, describing infrastructure using natural language.
- **AI-Powered Generation:** Copilot in Azure translates requirements into production-ready Terraform HCL code, following best practices and reducing the need for manual syntax checks.
- **Browser-Based Refinement:** Generated code can be moved to VS Code for the web, enabling team collaboration, configuration tweaking, and testing without local setup.
- **One-Click Deployment:** Deploy infrastructure using HCP Terraform or Azure for state management, ensuring consistency and traceability.

## Unified VS Code Extension

- **All-in-One Tooling:** Microsoftâ€™s new VS Code extension consolidates Terraform authoring, code completion, and intelligence into a single environment.
- **IntelliSense & Documentation:** Provides intelligent code completion, parameter hints, and inline docs for all Microsoft providers, reducing lookup overhead and errors.
- **Production-Ready Templates:** Includes a library of code samples and templates for common Azure architectures (microservices platforms, data pipelines, enterprise networks, etc.).
- **Export Feature:** Export existing Azure infrastructure as reusable HCL code, aiding transitions from manual to code-driven resource management.
- **Preflight Policy Validation:** Advanced validation tools can catch policy issues and configuration errors before deployment, integrating organizational standards and compliance directly into development workflows.

## MS Graph Provider: Expanding Microsoft Ecosystem Management

- **Beyond Infrastructure:** The new MS Graph provider adopts an AzAPI-style, allowing day-zero support of new Microsoft features and holistic resource management across Microsoft 365, Windows, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Dynamics 365.
- **Unified Configurations:** Infrastructure, productivity, and security settings can now be defined together within a single Terraform configuration, supporting full organizational IT automation.

## Getting Started

- **Update Tooling:** Upgrade to the latest VS Code extension and use Copilot features in the Azure portal to experience these enhancements.
- **Community and Documentation:** Reference official documentation and join the community for ongoing updates, tips, and support.

For practitioners and organizations, these updates aim to reduce friction in building, reviewing, and managing Microsoft-focused infrastructure as code through tighter tooling integration, AI-backed productivity, and expanded Microsoft resource support.
