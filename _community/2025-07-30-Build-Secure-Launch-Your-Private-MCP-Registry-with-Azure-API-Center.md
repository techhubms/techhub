In this article, JuliaKa explores how organizations can harness Azure API Center to build secure and governed private MCP registries, supporting enterprise AI development.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Article Summary

This article by JuliaKa delves into how organizations can modernize their AI tool management and discovery by establishing a private Machine-Callable Plugin (MCP) registry using Azure API Center. It provides a comprehensive overview of the motivations, benefits, and implementation strategies for transitioning from public MCP registries to a secure, centrally governed, and discoverable internal registry—demonstrated via the MCP Center.

### Why Use a Private MCP Registry?

- **Demand for Security and Governance:** As organizations increasingly use MCP servers and agentic tools, the potential risks of public registries—including security vulnerabilities and lack of control—grow. A private registry leverages Azure API Center's capabilities to mitigate these risks.
- **Modern Tool Catalog:** Azure API Center can act as an enterprise-ready repository, facilitating direct access for developers without the need for extra setup.

### Key Advantages of Azure API Center for MCP Registries

#### Security and Trust

- **Thorough Review:** All MCP servers are internally reviewed and verified, preventing unvetted tools or code from entering the organizational ecosystem.
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Limiting access to trusted internal tools reduces potential exploits.
- **Enterprise Authentication and Authorization:** Integrates with existing security protocols (like OAuth 2), ensuring strict access management.
- **AI Gateway Control:** Enables traffic routing through services like Azure API Management for consistent authentication, rate limiting, and threat protection.

#### Governance and Control

- **Centralized Oversight:** Provides a single authoritative source for all internal tools and data connections, increasing transparency and accountability.
- **Avoids 'Shadow AI':** Standardizes processes across teams, reducing unmanaged, unsanctioned AI tool deployments.
- **Tailored Tool Development:** Supports development and hosting of tools meeting unique organizational needs.
- **Accelerated Development:** Simplifies integration, enabling faster AI app creation and deployment.

### Getting Started & Community Involvement

- **No Upfront Cost:** Azure API Center can be provisioned for free in any Azure subscription.
- **Onboarding Partners:** The ecosystem is growing, with early partners—including Atlassian, Box, Neon, Pipedream, and Stripe—integrating their MCP servers with API Center.
- **MCP Discovery:** Developers and partners can list their MCP servers for broader discoverability among Azure customers via the MCP Discovery panel.
- **Contributing Servers:** Instructions for onboarding are provided through GitHub, encouraging community participation.

### Conclusion

The article encourages organizations to leverage Azure API Center and the MCP Center showcase to secure, govern, and accelerate the adoption and management of AI tools. It positions Azure API Center as a central solution for modern enterprises seeking operational security and innovation in AI-driven environments.
