# Optimize Azure Local Deployments with the Well-Architected Review Assessment

**Author:** Neil Bird

## Why Azure Local?

[Azure Local](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/local) brings Azure services to customer-owned infrastructure. It enables consistent cloud management and allows you to run both modern (containerized) and traditional (VM-based) applications in distributed on-premises or edge environments. With Azure Local, you can deploy Windows/Linux VMs, Azure Virtual Desktop, and containerized workloads with AKS Arc, while supporting additional services like [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/azure-arc-overview) and [Azure Machine Learning AKS compute targets](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-attach-kubernetes-anywhere?view=azureml-api-2).

This approach helps organizations meet data sovereignty, compliance, and low latency needs by keeping data and workloads on-premises while providing modern cloud management and deployment capabilities.

## What is the Well-Architected Framework?

The [Azure Well-Architected Framework (WAF)](https://aka.ms/WAF) offers a structured set of best practices for designing, deploying, and operating cloud solutions. It's organized into five pillars:

- **Reliability**
- **Security**
- **Cost Optimization**
- **Operational Excellence**
- **Performance Efficiency**

Following these principles helps architects and teams build robust, efficient, and scalable systems in Azure and hybrid environments.

## Azure Local Well-Architected Review Assessment

Microsoft has launched the [Azure Local | Well-Architected Review Assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/assessments/d8f04a92-c8b9-4ae7-8e51-61b8a1035942/)—a tool designed to help teams using Azure Local evaluate their deployment and operational maturity against the five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework. The assessment consists of Yes/No (or True/False) questions and delivers a risk or maturity score with actionable guidance and links to relevant resources.

### Who Should Use the Assessment?

Completing the assessment may require input from a range of team members:

- Azure Local platform administrators
- Application developers/owners
- IT security teams

Each question checks whether specific features or practices are implemented. Unchecked items indicate areas for improvement. Post-assessment, you receive tailored guidance and links to help address gaps.

For more information on using the platform, consult the [Microsoft Assessment Platform FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/assessments/support/).

## When to Complete the Assessment

You can perform the Well-Architected Review Assessment at any stage—but it's beneficial to do so early (e.g., design or pre-deployment) to incorporate recommendations before significant investment in architecture or code. Early assessment helps prevent costly rework and promotes alignment with proven best practices.

## Assessment User Experience Demo

A demo (animated GIF in the original content) illustrates the workflow for a fictional company (Contoso Manufacturing) completing the assessment for their Azure Local deployment. This shows the interface for answering questions, receiving scores, and accessing improvement recommendations.
