# How Azure Organizes Resources: Management Groups, Subscriptions, and Resource Groups

When deploying applications or managing infrastructure on Microsoft Azure, a clear understanding of Azure's resource hierarchy is crucial for effective administration, governance, and security. Azure uses a three-tiered organization structure:

## 1. Management Groups

- **Purpose:** Management Groups allow you to manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions.
- **Analogy:** Think of these as corporate headquarters setting broad strategy, policy, and security requirements for departments beneath.
- **Use Cases:** Applying organization-wide policies, such as security baselines or compliance mandates.

## 2. Subscriptions

- **Purpose:** Subscriptions act as containers for Azure resources and are typically aligned with departments or projects for billing and access control.
- **Analogy:** Like departments within a company, each with their own budget and access boundaries.
- **Use Cases:** Separate workloads, projects, or environments for billing and permissions isolation.

## 3. Resource Groups

- **Purpose:** Resource Groups are logical collections of related resources (virtual machines, storage, etc.) that share a common lifecycle.
- **Analogy:** Like project teams within departments, focusing on specific workloads or applications.
- **Use Cases:** Manage, deploy, and monitor resources collectively; apply tags and role-based access.

## Why Hierarchy Matters

- **Governance:** Centralize the application of policies and compliance requirements
- **Security:** Clearly control user and team access based on roles and responsibilities
- **Billing:** Track costs at both subscription and resource group levels

## Summary

Using Management Groups, Subscriptions, and Resource Groups allows organizations to scale and secure their Azure footprint efficiently. By aligning the hierarchy with your organization’s needs, you’ll simplify governance and operational management across the platform.
