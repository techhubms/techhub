# Made me chuckle - trying to stop artifact files being added

**Author:** okiokio

In this community post, okiokio shares a humorous meme depicting the ongoing struggle developers face when trying to prevent artifact files from being committed to version control systems, especially when working with tools like GitHub Copilot. The image (linked [here](https://i.redd.it/n1tm52poysgf1.png)) uses humor to illustrate how automated tools and workflows still sometimes result in unwanted files being tracked, signaling a universal challenge among developers.

While the post is intended as a lighthearted take, it highlights a real issue in software developmentâ€”maintaining a clean repository and avoiding unnecessary or generated files being committed. Developers often use .gitignore files or other configuration methods to avoid this, but even advanced tools like Copilot can stumble or require fine-tuning. This post resonates with the coding community's shared experiences and provides a relatable moment for individuals using GitHub Copilot in their daily workflow.
