# Troubleshooting Azure DevOps Pipeline for .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid App

**Author:** Background_March7229

## Scenario

The author attempts to build a simple .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid project for Windows using Azure DevOps. The project is new with no modifications and is pushed directly to Azure DevOps.

## Issue

During pipeline execution, the following error is encountered:

> Unable to find package Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.Mono.win-x64 with version

This occurs during the restore or publish phase when using .NET 9 and targeting `win-x64`.

## Pipeline Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main

pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

variables:
  buildConfiguration: 'Release'
  runtime: 'win-x64'
  dotnetVersion: '9.0.101'
  projectPath: 'MyApp/MyApp.csproj'
  targetFramework: 'net9.0-windows10.0.19041.0'
  outputDir: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/publish'

steps:
  - task: UseDotNet@2
    displayName: 'Install .NET 9.0.303 SDK'
    inputs:
      packageType: 'sdk'
      version: '$(dotnetVersion)'
      includePreviewVersions: true

  - task: NuGetToolInstaller@1

  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: 'Install .NET MAUI Workload'
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        dotnet workload install maui

  - task: NuGetCommand@2
    inputs:
      restoreSolution: 'MyApp/MyApp.sln'

  - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
    displayName: 'Publish MAUI App (.NET 9)'
    inputs:
      command: 'publish'
      projects: '$(projectPath)'
      arguments: >
        -c $(buildConfiguration) -f $(targetFramework) -r $(runtime) --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:WindowsPackageType=None -o $(outputDir)
```

### Additional Feedback

- A community member suggests using `DotNetCoreCLI@2` with a restore command instead of NuGet restore for .NET projects.
- The author reports receiving the same error after updating the pipeline to use `DotNetCoreCLI@2` for restore.

## Observations

- The error suggests the .NET MAUI workload or required runtime packs for the targeted platform/version might be unavailable or missing from the feed used by the pipeline.
- Using preview SDKs with MAUI requires careful matching of workloads, SDK versions, and platform support.
- The build process may require additional setup to enable preview features or install specific runtime packs.

## Suggestions for Similar Scenarios

- Ensure the specified `dotnetVersion` and the targeted framework are properly supported on the chosen build agent.
- Confirm that the MAUI workload installs the correct version and all platform-specific packs.
- If using a preview SDK, add steps/flags to enable preview features or consider pinning to a stable release if available.
- Use `DotNetCoreCLI@2` for both restore and build/publish over `NuGetCommand@2` to ensure best compatibility with modern .NET workloads.
- Check that `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.Mono.win-x64` is available for the selected SDK/runtime versions or adjust the runtime/platform target as needed.
