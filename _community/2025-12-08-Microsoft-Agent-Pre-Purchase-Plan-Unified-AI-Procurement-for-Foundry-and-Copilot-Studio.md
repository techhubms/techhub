# Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan: Unified AI Procurement for Foundry and Copilot Studio

Microsoft Ignite 2025 saw the introduction of new intelligence layers for agent development: **Work IQ, Fabric IQ, and Foundry IQ**. These layers empower agentic systems to deliver robust contextual understanding, connect to enterprise data, and orchestrate knowledge across platforms.

In conjunction, the launch of **Microsoft Agent Factory** gives organizations a unified framework to build, deploy, and manage agents powered by these intelligence layers.

Yet, deploying agents in real-world organizations faces practical hurdles: procurement fragmentation, budget unpredictability, and complex governance. With the choice of platforms—such as **Microsoft Foundry** and **Copilot Studio**—each offering different strengths, enterprises risk siloed investments and reduced flexibility.

## The Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan (P3)

**Microsoft Agent P3** provides a streamlined, pay-upfront purchasing option for agentic services:

- Commit for one year with a lump-sum pool of **Agent Commit Units (ACU)**.
- Use ACUs anytime in the plan year for Microsoft Foundry and Copilot Credit-enabled services.
- Usage is tracked automatically; top up or switch to pay-as-you-go as needed.
- Unused balance expires at year-end.

### Pricing and Cost Example

- As of November 2025 (subject to change), agent usage within Foundry and Copilot Studio is billed by ACU.
- For example, 1,500,000 Copilot Credits at {{CONTENT}}.01 per credit would cost $15,000 on pay-as-you-go. If also using 5000 Foundry Provisioned Throughput Units (PTU) at $1 each, add $5,000.
- Purchasing **Tier 1 (20,000 ACU) P3** at $19,000 yields ~5% savings over separate pay-as-you-go billing.

### What’s Covered

- 32 core services, including Azure AI Search, Cognitive Services, orchestration tools, and Copilot-powered agentic workloads.
- P3 spans both Foundry and Copilot Studio, eliminating SKU-level silos.

## Purchasing Microsoft Agent P3

- Access via **Azure Portal** → Reservations → + Add → Microsoft Agent Pre-Purchase Plan.
- Select subscription, scope, tier, and complete payment.

## Benefits of Agent P3

1. **One Unified Plan:** Pool credits across Foundry and Copilot-enabled agentic services.
2. **Broad Service Coverage:** Use 32+ services important for AI agents.
3. **Streamlined Governance:** Simplify procurement and budget management.
4. **Predictable Savings:** Fixed discounts, one budget pool.

## Conclusion

Organizations looking to scale AI agent deployments on Microsoft platforms benefit from simplified, unified procurement, transparent budgeting, and flexible credit use. The Agent Pre-Purchase Plan (P3) directly supports innovation at scale, taking advantage of the newest Microsoft IQ intelligence layers and core agentic platforms.
