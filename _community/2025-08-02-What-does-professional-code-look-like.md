RipeTide18 discusses challenges faced in backend development and asks how to write professional code, referencing dependency injection and industry methodologies.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

RipeTide18 reflects on their journey of coding their website's backend and the realization that their initial approach resulted in unmanageable, disorganized code. They describe the difficulty in refactoring what they consider a 'mess' and express the intention to restart the backend with a stronger focus on maintainability and professionalism.

The author has experimented with dependency injection and is curious if this approach aligns with industry standards or if there are superior methodologies in professional settings. They explicitly seek guidance on what constitutes professional code, effective methodologies, and practices that lead to easier future updates and refactoring.

### Main Points

- **Initial Experience**: The author completed a backend implementation only to find it was poorly structured and hard to maintain.
- **Refactoring Challenges**: Refactoring the current codebase proved too complex, pushing the author toward restarting development.
- **Focus on Best Practices**: With the upcoming rewrite, there's an emphasis on using methodologies that prioritize maintainability and professional standards.
- **Dependency Injection**: Recently learned and practiced, the author wonders if dependency injection is the main industry approach or if there are other better practices.
- **Community Inquiry**: The article culminates in an open question to the community: what does professional code look like, and what methodologies should be followed?

### Topics Covered

- Code maintainability and restructuring
- Software design methodologies
- Dependency injection
- Backend development
