# Level Up Your Python Gen AI Skills: Nine-Part YouTube Stream Series

**Presented by Pamela Fox**

Are you interested in implementing generative AI in your Python applications? This free live stream series delivers hands-on learning across nine in-depth sessions, with support for both English and Spanish speakers. You'll gain practical AI development skills with Python, plus the opportunity for live Q&A via weekly office hours on Discord.

## Series Overview

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Learn the fundamentals of LLMs like those behind ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. Practice prompt engineering, improve results with few-shot examples, and build a full-stack LLM-powered app. Python code examples rely on the OpenAI SDK and LangChain.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Understand how text and images are encoded as vectors. Experiment with vector search, distance metrics, and quantization using OpenAIâ€™s embedding models and Python libraries.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implement RAG pipelines to deliver grounded, domain-specific answers. Work through Python-based RAG flows and build a full-stack RAG app powered by Azure AI Search.
- **Vision Models**: Interact with multi-modal LLMs like GPT-4o. Develop Python solutions for image captioning, classification, and chat-on-images, building a multimodal search engine.
- **Structured Outputs**: Guide LLMs to emit structured, schema-compliant responses using @dataclass and Pydantic. Apply these to real use cases including entity extraction, workflow orchestration, and classification.
- **AI Safety and Evaluations**: Apply safety standards and evaluate output quality with Azure AI tools. Configure Azure AI Content Safety, handle exceptions in Python, and use the Azure AI Evaluation SDK for robust, ethical results.
- **Tool and Function Calling**: Aggregate tool integrations for LLMs and improve user experiences.
- **AI Agents**: Build advanced agents with frameworks like Langgraph, Semantic Kernel, Autogen, and Pydantic AI. Practice hand-offs, supervisor models, and custom workflows.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Explore this open protocol for extending AI agents and bots. Learn to develop MCP servers using FastMCP SDK and integrate with chatbots such as GitHub Copilot and agent frameworks.
