# Cloud Forensics: Implementing Security Baselines for Forensic Readiness in Microsoft Azure

**Author:** Mary_Asaolu  
**Published:** Updated Aug 08, 2025

## Overview

Monitoring and securing complex Azure environments is a multifaceted challenge. This guide presents actionable insights—drawn from real-world investigations—into achieving forensic readiness in the cloud through proper configuration, proactive planning, and robust monitoring.

## What is Forensic Readiness in the Cloud?

Forensic readiness is the state of having the appropriate tools, telemetry, and policies in place to collect, preserve, and analyze digital evidence before a security incident occurs. With Azure, this involves detailed logging, strong access controls, and routine validation of your cloud posture.

## Why It Matters

- **Dynamic Data and Shared Responsibility:** Azure’s multi-tenant architecture complicates evidence collection. Incomplete logging or weak controls can derail forensics or compliance efforts.
- **Incident Response Stakes:** Without forensic readiness, organizations struggle to identify intrusions and understand attacker behavior during investigations.

## Case Study: When Forensic Inadequacy Hinders Azure Investigations

A major cybersecurity breach involving an Azure virtual machine—"THA-VM"—demonstrates the pitfalls of poor forensic preparation:

- **Step 1: Detection Hurdles**
  - Absence of diagnostic logging on the VM and related storage resources deprived investigators of crucial telemetry (e.g., Windows Event Logs, NSG flow logs).
  - Missed detection of account creation, lateral movement, and attacker activities.
- **Step 2: Lost Evidence**
  - No OS disk snapshots or backups meant key disk artefacts (malware, system changes) could not be preserved or analyzed.
- **Step 3: Storage Account Blindspots**
  - Diagnostic logs for storage blobs were missing, so access patterns, uploads, and deletions remained opaque.
- **Step 4: Response Delays and Poor Escalation**
  - Slow engagement of the right stakeholders due to incomplete signals.
- **Step 5: Limited Recovery and Lessons Learned**
  - Only partial incident reconstruction; initial access vector undetermined. Highlighted need for Sentinel and Defender deployments, centralized logging, and stronger monitoring.

## Recommended Best Practices for Forensic Readiness

The following categories and actions serve as a practical baseline checklist for technical leads and cloud administrators:

### Identity and Access

- **Enable MFA for all Azure AD users** ([Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication))
- **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** ([RBAC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview), [PIM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-deployment-plan))
- **Activate regular access reviews and audit log collection** ([Azure Identity Protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview))
- **Apply Conditional Access policies for high-risk resources** ([Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access))

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Enable Azure Monitor** on all critical resources ([Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview))
- **Activate Defender for Cloud and Sentinel** for comprehensive detection ([Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/), [Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/))
- **Configure Diagnostic Logging** at the VM, storage, and data plane levels ([Diagnostic Logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-logs))
- **Centralize logs in a Log Analytics Workspace** ([Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview))
- **Set audit log retention to at least 365 days**  

### Data Protection

- **Encrypt data at rest and in transit** ([Encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption))
- **Leverage Azure Key Vault for secrets and keys** ([Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview))
- **Rotate keys and enable immutable backups** ([Immutable Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-immutable-storage))
- **Configure File Integrity Monitoring** (e.g., Defender for Storage)

### Network Security

- **Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs)** with least-privilege rules ([NSG Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview))
- **Enable DDoS protection** for critical infrastructure ([DDoS Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview))
- **Use VPN or ExpressRoute for secure connectivity** ([VPN Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/))

### Incident Response

- **Set up Azure Sentinel alerts** for suspicious activity ([Sentinel Alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/))
- **Automate responses** using Azure Logic Apps ([Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/))
- **Integrate threat intelligence and run advanced KQL queries** ([Threat Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/connect-threat-intelligence-tip), [KQL in Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/kusto-sentinel-overview?view=microsoft-sentinel))
- **Maintain an up-to-date, documented incident response plan**  

### Policies and Processes

- **Formalize a forensic readiness policy and provide admin training** ([Azure Security Training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/))

## Conclusion

Forensic readiness in Azure is an ongoing process that requires:

- Enabling comprehensive diagnostics and telemetry
- Centralizing and retaining critical logs
- Enforcing strong access controls and continuous monitoring
- Building workflows and policies tailored to cloud-specific threats

Adopting these security baselines equips organizations to detect, investigate, and mitigate security incidents confidently, helping ensure compliance and reducing recovery times.
