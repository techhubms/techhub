Logico_jp explains how to enable metrics, log, and trace telemetry for Micronaut applications, including GraalVM Native Images, on Azure Monitor. The article discusses integration options and the recently introduced micronaut-azure-tracing dependency.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Sending Metrics, Logs, and Traces from Micronaut Native Image Applications to Azure Monitor

*Author: Logico_jp*

## Overview

This guide addresses how to collect and send metrics, logs, and traces from Micronaut-based applications running on Azure, including support for GraalVM Native Images, leveraging the latest updates in the Micronaut ecosystem.

## Customer Query

A customer using Micronaut for microservices on Azure Container Apps requested:

- How to send traces (beyond logs/metrics) to Azure Monitor.
- Whether this works with GraalVM Native Image builds.

## Context: Existing Solutions in Java Frameworks

Java frameworks like Spring Boot and Quarkus offer built-in dependencies to facilitate Azure Monitor integration:

- [Spring Boot Starter for OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/spring-boot-starter/)
- [Quarkus OpenTelemetry Exporter for Azure](https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-opentelemetry-exporter/dev/quarkus-opentelemetry-exporter-azure.html)
- [Monitoring Spring Boot Native Images on Azure](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/monitor-your-spring-boot-native-image-application-on-azure/)
- [Monitoring Quarkus Native Apps on Azure](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/monitor-your-quarkus-native-application-on-azure/)

## Options to Enable Telemetry in Micronaut on Azure

### 1. Java Agent

- Easiest to use for Java applications.
- Drawbacks: Increased startup time; not compatible with Native Images as of July 2025.

### 2. Fat JAR with Micronaut Dependencies

- Use dependencies like `io.micronaut.micrometer:micronaut-micrometer-registry-azure-monitor` and `io.micronaut.azure:micronaut-azure-logging` for metrics and logs.
- Previously, no direct dependency for traces.

### 3. Azure Monitor Agent with OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)

- Enable Azure Monitor Agent in Azure Container Apps environment.
- Works with any application stack.
- **Limitation**: Cannot send metrics (per [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/opentelemetry-agents)).

## Recent Improvements â€” Trace Support for Micronaut Native Images

As of Micronaut 4.9.0, the new dependency `io.micronaut.azure:micronaut-azure-tracing` enables sending traces to Application Insights. This is powered by the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure Distro, not by the Azure Monitor Agent.

- **Compatibility:** Works with GraalVM Native Images.
- **No need to abandon Native Images** for trace support.
- See [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry SDK Autoconfigure Distro documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/monitor-opentelemetry-autoconfigure-readme?view=azure-java-stable)

## Key Considerations for Sending Telemetry

- Use Micronaut dependencies for logs/metrics/traces:
  - Metrics: `micronaut-micrometer-registry-azure-monitor`
  - Logs: `micronaut-azure-logging`
  - Traces: `micronaut-azure-tracing` (since 4.9.0)
- For Azure Container Apps:
  - Agent-based OTLP is simple, but does not handle metrics.
  - Fat JAR with dependencies allows full coverage, including traces in Native Images.

## Conclusion

Micronaut 4.9.0 introduces direct support for sending traces to Azure Monitor from both JAR and GraalVM Native Image applications using the `micronaut-azure-tracing` dependency. Combined with logging and metrics dependencies, this enables comprehensive observability for Micronaut applications on Azure.
