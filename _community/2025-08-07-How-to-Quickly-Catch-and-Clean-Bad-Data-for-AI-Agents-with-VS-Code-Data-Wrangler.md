# How to Quickly Catch and Clean Bad Data for AI Agents with VS Code Data Wrangler

Welcome back to **Agent Support**—a developer advice column designed to solve the everyday headaches of building smarter AI agents. This installment tackles a frequent and frustrating problem: preventing bad data from undermining your machine learning agents.

## Problem: Dirty Data, Weird Predictions

One developer writes:
> *I’m training an agent on a large CSV file, but I keep running into weird predictions. I suspect my data has missing values and other issues, but I don’t have time to spin up a Jupyter notebook just to poke around. Is there a faster way to explore and clean the data?*

## Why Bad Data Is a Big Deal

"Garbage-in, garbage-out" is no joke. Feeding incomplete, inconsistent, or simply wrong data into your agent means:

- Skewed evaluation metrics
- Code exceptions
- Untrustworthy answers

Investing just five minutes in quick data exploration can save hours of debugging and re-training later on.

## When to Inspect Your Data

You should always check your datasets when:

- Ingesting new data sources (CSV, Parquet, etc.)
- Noticing performance drops in your agent
- Running expensive jobs like fine-tuning or batch inferencing

## Diagnose Data Issues Fast

Focus on three key areas:

1. **Completeness**: Find nulls, blanks, or "N/A" values
2. **Distribution**: Look for outliers or impossible numbers
3. **Consistency**: Check that categories/text fields are standardized

Catching these issues early lets you decide whether to drop, impute, or standardize data before training.

## The VS Code Data Wrangler Solution

The [Data Wrangler extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.datawrangler) enables no-code data exploration and cleaning directly in your editor. It supports CSV, Parquet, Excel, and JSONL files, offering instant column statistics and intuitive data-fixing features:

### Steps to Clean Data Fast

1. **Install** Data Wrangler from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace
2. **Open** your data file in Data Wrangler (right-click and select "Open in Data Wrangler")
3. **Review Column Insights** for nulls, errors, and value distributions
4. **Filter Rows** (e.g., focus on specific locations or conditions)
5. **Drop Missing Data** in one click
6. **Aggregate Quickly** to confirm min/mean/max values
7. **Export** your cleaned dataset for immediate use

This process gives you a trustworthy dataset for your next agent fine-tune or evaluation—no code required.
