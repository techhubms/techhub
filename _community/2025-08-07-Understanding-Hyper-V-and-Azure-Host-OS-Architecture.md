# Understanding Hyper-V and Azure Host OS Architecture

**Author:** mogeko233

This community post explores the foundational architecture behind Microsoft Azure’s use of Hyper-V and the Azure Host OS, clarifying common confusions about virtualization layers, privileges, and the software stack.

---

## Key Discussion Points

- **Primary Question:** Is Hyper-V running on Azure Host OS, or is Azure Host OS running on Hyper-V?
- The article references [Azure Host OS – Cloud Host](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windowsosplatform/azure-host-os-%E2%80%93-cloud-host/3709528) and [Hyper-V Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-architecture).
- Hyper-V is confirmed as a Type 1 hypervisor. This means it runs directly on the hardware, not inside a host operating system.
- The "Azure Host OS" refers to a highly privileged virtualized partition, or root partition, provided by Hyper-V. This OS doesn't directly control the hardware; the hypervisor does. The root partition provides management, I/O, and exposes the platform for guest VMs.

---

## Technical Clarification and Architecture

- **Physical Hardware → Hyper-V Hypervisor → Azure Host OS (Root Partition) → Guest VMs (Child Partitions)**
- When a physical Azure machine boots, BIOS/firmware loads the Hyper-V hypervisor first. This is the true lowest layer of software.
- The Azure Host OS (customized Windows Server Core) is installed as the root partition, running with high privilege under Hyper-V, not above it.
- All other VMs (tenant/customer VMs) run as child partitions, managed and scheduled by Hyper-V.
- The hypervisor leverages hardware acceleration (x86 virtualization, Intel VT-x, protection rings) so that the root partition and guest partitions can run at similar privilege levels, reducing virtualization overhead.

---

## Key Insights and Community Wisdom

- The distinction between host OS and hypervisor is often confused due to terminology shifts and Microsoft’s changing documentation.
- The term "host OS" in Azure is effectively the root partition managed by Hyper-V, not a traditional OS that owns the hardware.
- Virtualization theory (including protection rings and hardware privilege levels) is crucial to understanding why Hyper-V is considered a true type 1 hypervisor, and why the Azure Host OS is not analogous to a PC’s primary OS.

- [x86 Virtualization (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization#Intel_virtualization_%28VT-x%29)

- [Server Core in Windows Server 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2008#Server_Core)

---

## Simplified Takeaway

- The Azure hardware runs the Hyper-V hypervisor directly; above that is a minimal Windows OS (the root partition), which handles VM management and host services. All tenant/customer VMs run in separate "child partitions" beneath Hyper-V’s virtualization.
- The community recommends thinking of Azure’s architecture as:  
  **Hardware → Hyper-V → Root Partition (Azure Host OS) → Guest VMs**
- Historical evolution and Microsoft naming conventions can add confusion, but this model remains accurate for today's Azure architecture.
