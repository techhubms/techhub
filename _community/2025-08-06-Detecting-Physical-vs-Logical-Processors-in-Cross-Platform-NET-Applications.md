# Detecting Physical vs Logical Processors in Cross-Platform .NET Applications

**Author:** Eisenmonoxid1

## Problem Statement

In building a cross-platform .NET 9 application, the goal is to:

- Retrieve the number of available processors
- Determine for each whether it is a physical core or a logical (HT/SMT) processor
- Build a processor bitmask based on this information

## Current Challenges

- `.NET` exposes `Environment.ProcessorCount`, which gives only the logical processor count.
- There appears to be no cross-platform mechanism within .NET to distinguish between physical and logical processors directly.

## Platform-Specific Approaches

### Windows

- Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or P/Invoke (Platform Invocation) can be used to extract detailed processor information on Windows platforms.

### Linux/macOS

- On Linux, `/proc/cpuinfo` presents detailed information about CPU cores and threads, though parsing is required. For the macOS platform, equivalent facilities may exist but are not addressed in detail here.

#### Linux Example Command

```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo
```

## Cross-Platform Strategy

- No .NET-native, uniform API exists for all operating systems.
- The proposed approach is to detect the operating system at runtime and call the relevant native API or parse system files as appropriate.
- Microsoft documentation (see referenced doc) provides guidance on guarding platform-specific API usage:
  - [Platform Compatibility Analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/analyzers/platform-compat-analyzer#guard-platform-specific-apis-with-guard-methods)

## Processor Architecture Clarifications

- All logical processors are ultimately backed by one or more physical cores.
- Not all physical cores use Hyper-Threading (HT) or Simultaneous MultiThreading (SMT).
- Solely knowing the number of logical processors (e.g., 32) does not suffice to infer the number of physical processors, due to possible architectural variations (e.g., 16 dual-threaded cores vs. 32 single-threaded cores).

### Example

- The Intel i9-14900K has 32 logical processors and 24 physical cores. The breakdown can vary between architectures and manufacturers, highlighting the difficulty of a universal software solution.

## Key Takeaways

- Platform-specific code or scripting is required to identify physical vs. logical processors cross-platform.
- .NET developers should combine environment detection with system file parsing or native API calls.
- The hardware landscape and OS reporting may introduce ambiguity that cannot always be resolved in a fully generic fashion.
