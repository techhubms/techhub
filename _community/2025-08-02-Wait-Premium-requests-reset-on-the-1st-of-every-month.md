In this Reddit post, livejc discusses the billing and premium request reset policy for GitHub Copilot Pro+, raising concerns about transparency and fairness for users subscribing at different times during the month.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

Reddit user **livejc** shares their experience and raises concerns with the premium request reset policy of GitHub Copilot Pro+.

### Key Points

- **Billing vs. Request Reset:** The author assumed premium requests would reset on the billing anniversary (the subscription date). Instead, they learned premium requests are reset on the 1st of each calendar month.
- **Perceived Unfairness:** This leads to a situation where users subscribing at the end of the month could get nearly two months' worth of requests in a very short time, while those subscribing at the start of the month might feel short-changed, potentially losing out on almost a full month's allocation.
- **Clarity of Information:** The author highlights that this detail was not clearly communicated during the subscription process, expressing frustration at the lack of transparency.
- **Open Questions:** The author wonders if there are adjustments for late-month subscribers or if everyone receives the same request allocation regardless of the sign-up day.
- **User Sentiment:** Overall, the post reflects a desire for more obvious and accessible information about key subscription mechanics.

### Practical Takeaways

- **Understanding Reset Policies:** It's important for users to be aware that GitHub Copilot Pro+ premium requests reset based on the calendar month, not their billing anniversary.
- **Subscription Timing Impact:** Prospective subscribers might consider when they sign up to maximize the value of their first month's premium requests.
- **Need for Transparency:** The experience underlines the need for software providers like GitHub to clarify and highlight such policies for users during onboarding.

## Conclusion

This post provides valuable feedback from a user perspective regarding the mechanics of premium request allocations in GitHub Copilot Pro+. Clarity and transparency around feature limits can significantly shape user satisfaction and subscription value.
