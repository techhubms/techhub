In this post, SalishSeaview outlines their experience setting up GitHub Enterprise with Copilot for a consulting firm, touching on pricing, Codespaces, and CI/CD pipelines.<!--excerpt_end-->

## GitHub Enterprise + Copilot: First-Impressions and Observations

**Author: SalishSeaview**

I recently signed up for GitHub Enterprise for my small consulting firm, then added a Copilot subscription on top. The combined subscription provides 1000 premium Copilot requests per user per month and costs $60 per user. This is my first month using the service extensively, and though I anticipate possibly encountering some overage charges, overall, the value seems solid compared to alternative solutions.

### Codespaces Integration

Over the weekend, I experimented with using Codespaces in combination with Copilot. The experience was seamlessâ€”particularly, setting up callbacks from external resources to the Codespace VM worked without the typical hassle (no need to battle with tools like `ngrok`).

### CI/CD Pipeline

An additional advantage of the Enterprise plan is the included CI/CD minutes: 50,000 per month. For reference, a month only has about 43,000 minutes. As long as my builds don't run in too many parallel jobs, I shouldn't run into limitations, even with heavy testing and deployment cycles.

### Next Steps

My immediate next objective is to set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment to a Digital Ocean droplet whenever tests pass. This will streamline delivery for my consulting projects and take advantage of the services already included in the GitHub Enterprise subscription.

### Cost Perspective and Recommendation

If your team spends more than $60 per month on agentic coding and related services, I recommend evaluating a GitHub Enterprise subscription. For small shops like mine, the bundled features and smooth Copilot integration could offer significant value.
