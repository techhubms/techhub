# Tools and Approaches for Migrating Obsolete .NET Framework APIs to .NET 8

## Overview

Migrating from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 8 often surfaces obstacles involving APIs that are either obsolete or no longer available in the latest platform. This post by GopalKrishnan discusses common issues, such as `System.IO.DirectoryInfo.FullName` being unsupported, and seeks guidance on available tools or approaches to efficiently identify and replace such APIs across multiple projects.

## Common Migration Challenges

- **Obsolete/Unsupported APIs**: Some APIs present in .NET Framework do not exist or are unsupported in .NET 8. Migrating code that relies on these means finding viable alternatives or new implementations.
- **Multi-Project Complexity**: Larger solutions with multiple projects may face issues where dependencies and internal libraries add complexity to the migration process.
- **Partial Automated Migration**: Tools like Upgrade Assistant can help automate some aspects, but often leave projects targeting .NET Standard or fail to upgrade portions with major compatibility issues.

## Tools and Approaches

### 1. .NET Upgrade Assistant

- Attempts project-level migration and highlights incompatibilities.
- Not always sufficient for complete migration, especially when dependencies or APIs are deeply unsupported.

### 2. .NET Portability Analyzer

- [Portability Analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/analyzers/portability-analyzer) (ApiPort) scans assemblies to report on APIs not supported in target frameworks.
- Generates detailed reports to help prioritize which APIs need to be addressed.

### 3. Roslyn-Based Code Analyzers

- Roslyn analyzers (such as [Refactoring Essentials](https://github.com/icsharpcode/RefactoringEssentials)) can be used to detect obsolete or deprecated APIs in code.
- Custom analyzers can automate refactoring where common patterns exist.

### 4. Manual Dependency and Reference Review

- Review dependency tree and NuGet packages to ensure updated versions compatible with .NET 8 exist.
- Cross-reference problematic APIs with [Microsoft's breaking changes documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/?tabs=netcore31).

### 5. Incremental Refactoring & Testing

- Address library upgrade issues first before migrating projects to .NET 8.
- Refactor or replace unsupported APIs progressively.
- Adopt automated testing to ensure functional parity post-migration.

## Best Practices

- **Start with Analysis**: Use Portability Analyzer before migration to scope the effort required.
- **Update Dependencies**: Replace or update third-party libraries with .NET 8 compatible versions.
- **Refactor in Batches**: Tackle one set of obsolete APIs or one project at a time to avoid overwhelming changes.
- **Automate Where Possible**: Leverage code analyzers and refactoring tools to automate mechanical updates.
- **Maintain a Migration Checklist**: Track unsupported APIs, replacement patterns, and project-specific issues for consistency across teams.

## Summary

A successful migration to .NET 8 requires a combination of automated scanning, manual review, and targeted refactoring. While Upgrade Assistant provides a jumping-off point, tools like Portability Analyzer and custom Roslyn analyzers are invaluable for systemically identifying and replacing obsolete APIs. Collaboration and incremental migration are key, especially for complex multi-project solutions.
