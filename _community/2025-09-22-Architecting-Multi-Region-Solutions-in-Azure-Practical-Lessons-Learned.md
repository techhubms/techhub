# Architecting Multi-Region Solutions in Azure: Lessons Learned

**Author:** prjelesi-msft

## Using Azure as a Cloud, Not Just a Region

Azure offers a global cloud platform, not merely a set of isolated regional data centers. By thinking beyond a single-region deployment, organizations can unlock improved reliability, scalability, security, cost efficiency, and compliance. This article summarizes practical lessons and recommendations from real-world Azure architecture projects.

## Why Adopt a Multi-Region Azure Strategy?

- **Scalability:** Avoid resource shortages by distributing workloads. Azure enforces quotas per region—multi-region deployments limit wait times and help scale opportunistically (e.g., with spot VMs).
- **Service Availability:** Some Azure services or features launch in limited regions. Deploying across more regions ensures access to necessary features as they become available.
- **Cost Optimization:** Regional differences in pricing can be leveraged. Non-essential workloads may run cheaper in less expensive regions, maximizing cost-efficiency.
- **Performance & Latency:** Place services near users to reduce latency and improve global application responsiveness.
- **Compliance & Data Residency:** Adhere to legal and industry requirements by hosting data in regulated regions (e.g., EU data within EU).
- **Disaster Recovery (DR) & Resilience:** Architect active-active or active-passive solutions for high availability. Use replication services (Geo-redundant storage, Azure SQL Auto-failover, Azure Site Recovery) to safeguard against outages.
- **Agility for New Regions:** Rapidly adopt recently launched Azure regions for local presence, performance, or regulation changes.

## Understanding Region Flexibility

Region flexibility means being ready to deploy, migrate, or failover resources into any region as needed without complex rework. Platform designs based on Azure Landing Zones and the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework establish the foundation for this agility—enabling identity, governance, and networking patterns that can scale globally.

## Greenfield vs. Brownfield: Strategies for Multi-Region Adoption

### Greenfield (New Environments)

- **Start with Multi-Region in Mind:** Use the Cloud Adoption Framework and Landing Zone architectures.
- **Region-Agnostic Foundation:** Provision core infrastructure via ARM, Bicep, or Terraform. Support adding regions smoothly.
- **Shared Services:** Design for shared DNS, monitoring, and identity spanning future regions.
- **Team Alignment:** Educate development and operations on region-agnostic patterns, stateless service design, and failover processes.

### Brownfield (Existing Environments)

- **Assess Current Architecture:** Identify region-specific configs in networking, identity, policies, and monitoring.
- **Integrate New Regions:** Update virtual networks (e.g., by adding new hubs or peering), replicate identity services if needed, and adjust policy assignments for new geography.
- **Review Service Availability:** Check for resource or external dependency limitations in target regions.
- **Enhance DR Strategies:** Validate cross-region replication setups for storage and databases.
- **Resource Discovery:** Use available scripts and tools (like Azure2AzureTK) to list regionally dependent services.
- **Plan and Remediate:** Make stepwise changes to remove single-region assumptions.

## Selecting Azure Regions: Key Considerations

- **Service/Feature Availability:** Not all Azure services (or SKUs) are available everywhere; check the [Product Availability by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table).
- **Cost Differences:** Compare pricing, especially for compute and storage across regions.
- **Latency & Performance:** Evaluate proximity to user base and networking quality.
- **Compliance & Data Residency:** Validate region certifications and legal boundaries.
- **Resilience & DR Options:** Use regions with Availability Zones for intra-region HA, and consider paired regions for cross-region DR.
- **Quotas:** Ensure sufficient resource quotas, particularly for high-scale workloads.
- **Sustainability:** Some regions feature greener datacenters, supporting environmental commitments.

## Lessons Learned

- **Global Scaling from Day One:** Multi-region design is easier done up-front than added later.
- **DR is Just One Benefit:** Scaling, cost-savings, and compliance can drive multi-region architectures.
- **Prepare for Increased Complexity:** Operations, monitoring, governance, and DevOps require updated processes and tools.
- **Periodic Review:** Azure regions and features evolve—keep evaluating and adjusting your region strategy.
