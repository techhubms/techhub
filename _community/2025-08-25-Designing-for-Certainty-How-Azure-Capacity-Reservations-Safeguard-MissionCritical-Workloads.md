Goutham_Bandapati explores strategic use of Azure Capacity Reservations and Reserved Instances, detailing how they can be combined to reliably support mission-critical workloads while optimizing costs.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Designing for Certainty: How Azure Capacity Reservations Safeguard Mission‑Critical Workloads

Ensuring consistent compute availability is a non-negotiable for business-critical cloud services. In this article, Goutham_Bandapati provides an in-depth look at why Azure Capacity Reservations are essential for mission-critical reliability, how they differ from Reserved Instances, and why using both is the recommended approach for resilient, efficient architectures.

## Why Capacity Reservations Matter Now

- Cloud demand is increasing rapidly and can spike unpredictably.
- Zones or specific VM SKUs may quickly become constrained, especially during events or surges (e.g., retail peaks, AI pipelines).
- Capacity Reservations let you lock compute capacity for specific VM sizes in a region or zone, turning placement from a gamble into an engineered guarantee.

## Key Concepts: Region, Zone, and SKU

- **Region:** Largest pool, offering flexibility but not guaranteed zone availability.
- **Zone:** Provides fault domain isolation, often where contention appears first.
- **SKU:** Specific VM sizes (e.g., Standard_Dv5), which may have varying availability.

Azure Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve capacity for chosen VM sizes at the regional or zonal level, ensuring VMs and scale sets can be launched reliably.

## Comparing Pay‑as‑you‑go, Capacity Reservations, and Reserved Instances

| Attribute         | Pay‑as‑you‑go           | Capacity Reservations             | Reserved Instances                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Primary Purpose   | Flexibility, no commitment | Guarantee availability (VM size) | Cost reduction for steady use        |
| Guarantees        | None beyond current     | Specific capacity in region/zone  | Price discount, not capacity         |
| Scope             | Region/zone at runtime  | Specific region or zone           | Billing benefit, not placement       |
| Commitment        | None                    | Active while kept                 | 1 or 3 year term                     |

### Clarifications

- **Capacity reservations do NOT equal discounts:** They're meant solely to secure availability, and you pay for them while active.
- **Reserved Instances do NOT guarantee capacity:** They only reduce the rate for matching VM usage.
- **Combined Strategy:** Capacity Reservations for assured placement; Reserved Instances to minimize costs of usage hours.

## Universal Cloud Capacity Challenges

- All major cloud providers experience finite resources and local surges. Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud have similar tools serving this purpose.
- If your architecture absolutely requires a certain VM type in a specific location, capacity planning is vital.

## Architecting for Critical Workloads

- **Reserve capacity** for events like Black Friday or tax deadlines to protect SLAs.
- **Plan high availability across zones**: Hold reserve compute proportional to failover loads.
- **Mitigate risks during maintenance**: Use reservation groups to ensure VMs don't lose placement after deallocation.
- **Handle fixed-SKU dependencies**: Reserve by SKU and prepare a fallback plan if possible.
- **Meet regulatory or latency constraints**: Favor zonal reservations to pin workloads to required locations.

## Combining Reserved Instances and Capacity Reservations

- **Layer 1: Availability**: Use Capacity Reservations to ensure VMs can always be placed.
- **Layer 2: Economics**: Layer Reserved Instances for the baseline workload to maximize cost savings.
- Surge needs can be handled with short-lived reservations or pay-as-you-go.
- Monitor and adjust coverage and utilization ratios for both reservation types.
- Use chargeback approaches so capacity “insurance” costs only affect the workloads requiring strict SLAs.

## Conclusion

Building true resilience in the cloud means more than redundancy—it’s about guaranteed access to resources. Azure Capacity Reservations provide assured placement, while Reserved Instances deliver savings. Using both ensures workloads stay available and budgets stay controlled, even during the highest demand.
