# Azure AI Blogs Consolidated into Azure AI Foundry Blog

**Author:** GalimahB

## What’s Changed

Multiple Azure AI community blogs—including the AI Platform Blog, Azure AI Services Blog, and Azure Machine Learning Blog—are now merged into the new [Azure AI Foundry Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry). This centralizes technical news, tutorials, and announcements for easier discovery and a unified experience.

## Seamless Access to Past Content

All previous posts from the legacy blogs have been migrated to the Azure AI Foundry Blog, and existing bookmarks or saved links automatically redirect to their new home. This ensures continuity and smooth navigation for community members.

## Action Required: Update Your Subscription

Email/RSS subscriptions from the old blogs have **not** been automatically transferred. To continue receiving the latest Azure AI updates, re-subscribe directly to the [Azure AI Foundry Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry) using the "Follow" button on its homepage.

*Note: This one-time action is required to maintain your connection to Azure AI innovations and technical updates.*

## Looking Ahead

This blog consolidation is positioned as the first step towards a more streamlined, insightful community experience, helping practitioners keep up with Microsoft's AI tools, services, and real-world solutions in one place.
