Jammie1 discusses Microsoft's enhancements to Dependabot, focusing on a native .NET updater for NuGet that promises faster and more efficient dependency updates.<!--excerpt_end-->

## The New Dependabot NuGet Updater: 65% Faster with Native .NET

### Overview

The article by Jammie1 discusses Microsoft's recent update to Dependabot's NuGet functionality. Previously, Dependabot updates for NuGet packages operated using an external process. Now, with a native .NET implementation, the speed of automated dependency updates has increased dramatically—by up to 65%—delivering tangible benefits for developers managing .NET projects.

### Key Improvements

- **Native .NET Implementation:** Dependabot now uses a .NET-native process for NuGet package management, eliminating performance overhead from previous methods.
- **Faster Updates:** The shift to native .NET execution enables much quicker dependency checks and updates. Speed statistics show up to a 65% reduction in update time for NuGet dependencies.
- **Reliability:** With the move to core .NET, developers can expect improved accuracy and compatibility with the latest NuGet features and standards.

### Impact for Developers

- **Increased Productivity:** The faster update process means developers spend less time waiting for dependency checks, enabling quicker builds and releases.
- **Modern .NET Support:** By integrating more tightly with the .NET ecosystem, Dependabot is better positioned to support new .NET features as they are released.
- **CI/CD Efficiency:** The improvements directly contribute to more responsive continuous integration and delivery workflows for repositories that rely on NuGet.

### How to Benefit

Developers leveraging GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipelines that rely on Dependabot for NuGet updates will automatically benefit from these enhancements. No special configuration is needed; the updated functionality is rolled out by Microsoft as part of Dependabot's service upgrades.
