UnityDever shares a custom state machine library for C#, seeking feedback on its architecture and design. The article welcomes constructive suggestions from the development community.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

UnityDever, an enthusiast outside the professional software developer sphere, presents a new C# state machine library—Lombda.StateMachine—and invites feedback from the programming community. The library was developed as part of work on LombdaAgentSDK, a C# Agent Library.

## Purpose of the Article

The main objective is to seek feedback on key aspects:

- **Architecture:** How well-structured is the library?
- **Design principles:** Does the approach align with best practices in C#?
- **Usability:** Are the interfaces intuitive and flexible for users?

## Key Features

- Developed in C#, and suitable for agent-based applications
- Open-source, with the repository accessible on GitHub
- Designed to be reusable and adaptable

## Call to Action

UnityDever encourages:

- Constructive critique related to code structure, maintainability, and extensibility
- Suggestions for improvement or additional features
- Insightful discussion in the context of software architecture in C#

## Where to Engage
