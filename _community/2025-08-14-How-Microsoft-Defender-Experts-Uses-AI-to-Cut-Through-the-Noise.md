# How Microsoft Defender Experts Uses AI to Cut Through the Noise

Today's security teams face an overwhelming volume of alerts, many of which are false alarms or benign events. Microsoft Defender Experts—a managed extended detection and response (XDR) service—addresses this challenge by employing AI-based incident classification tailored to improve both efficiency and accuracy in security operations.

## Teaching AI to Think Like a Security Expert

Defender Experts has implemented an AI-driven system that filters security noise without compromising true threat detection. Trained on insights from hundreds of thousands of real incident investigations, this AI leverages:

- **Historical Intelligence:** Reviewing past investigation data from security analysts to guide current incident classification.
- **Rich Contextual Analysis:** Evaluating signals including evidence, tenant details, IOC (Indicators of Compromise), and threat intelligence.
- **Similarity Scoring:** Assigning scores based on how closely new incidents match known true positives, false positives, or benign cases.

The end result is a system that de-grades incidents resembling past noise and escalates those similar to known threats, allowing analysts to concentrate on truly actionable issues.

## Human-Centric and Safe

To maintain trust and safeguard against missed threats, the AI system includes multiple human-centric guardrails:

- **Tiered Decisioning:** All AI-classified noise is reviewed by Defender Expert analysts to verify accuracy.
- **Feedback Loops:** Analyst reviews feed into machine learning improvements, minimizing risk of missing real threats.
- **Transparency:** Classification decisions and their rationale are made visible to human analysts.

This balanced approach ensures that while AI handles repetitive filtering, experts stay in control of critical decisions.

## Accelerated and Improved Response

Key benefits realized by Microsoft Defender Experts through this AI integration include:

- Automated triage of approximately 50% of noise incidents with high precision.
- Faster escalation and handling of true security threats.
- Improved analyst focus and reduced wasted effort on irrelevant events.

> “We no longer waste time chasing dead ends. The system helps us focus on what truly matters and our customers appreciate how quickly we can respond.” — Defender Experts Tier2 Analyst

## Looking Forward

Future improvements are in progress, including:

- Finer-grained risk scoring for individual entities
- Better correlation based on tenant and IOC details
- More real-time feedback from analysts to further improve the AI

## Summary

By combining AI automation with human expertise, Microsoft Defender Experts reduces analyst workload and enhances response times for customer organizations. Their approach demonstrates how modern SOCs can become faster, smarter, and more accountable.
