Discommodian shares their experience with unpredictable disappearance of tags, branches, and releases in their GitHub repository, seeking advice from the community.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Introduction

Discommodian details a perplexing issue encountered while managing a GitHub repository with multiple branches, tags, and releases. Despite following established git procedures and having limited GitHub automation, certain repository elements (tags, branches, releases) periodically disappear seemingly without cause.

## Workflow Overview

- **Platform:** Mac
- **Repository Setup:** Local clone with two main working branches
- **Branch Management:**
  - Works mainly on `main` and a secondary branch
  - Uses git commands to push tags and branches
    - Example for pushing all tags: `git push --tags`
    - Switching and pushing branches: `git checkout branch`, then `git push origin branch`
  - Both branches expected to appear in GitHub
- **Release Process:**
  - New releases are created through the GitHub web interface
  - The release process on GitHub also creates a tag

## Observed Issues

- Tags created and pushed locally appear on GitHub as expected, but later disappear
- Secondary branch sometimes disappears from GitHub
- Recently, even a GitHub release has vanished
- These issues do not align with normal git or GitHub behavior

## Automation and Integrations

- One previously active Snyk webhook, currently inactive
- GitHub Action exists for building a Docker container
- The problem occurs even when pushing to a branch that does not trigger the GitHub Action

## Attempts at Resolution

- Checked active webhooks and automations for interference
- Verified that workflow and git commands are standard practice

## Seeking Input

Discommodian appeals to the developer community for insights, suspecting a misunderstanding or subtle misconfiguration in repository or workflow management that is causing elements (tags, branches, releases) to disappear, despite seemingly correct usage of GitHub and git.
