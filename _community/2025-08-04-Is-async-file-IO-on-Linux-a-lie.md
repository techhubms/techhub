title: "Is async file I/O on Linux a lie?"
description: "FergoTheGreat raises concerns about the true behavior of async file I/O on Linux with .NET. Despite using async options like FileOptions.Asyncronous or useAsync = true, and seeing file handles report .IsAsync == true, Linux handles do not appear to have O_ASYNC or O_NONBLOCK flags when inspected. This suggests underlying system behavior may differ from expectations."

In this Reddit post, FergoTheGreat examines the behavior of asynchronous file I/O in .NET on Linux, noting possible discrepancies between .NET's async indicators and actual Linux kernel flags.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Exploring Async File I/O Behavior in .NET on Linux

Author: FergoTheGreat

The post investigates a potential discrepancy in how asynchronous file I/O is implemented or reported on Linux systems when using .NET. Specifically:

- **Async File Handle Creation in .NET**: When a file handle is created with methods such as `File.OpenHandle` or `FileStream` (possibly combined with `SafeFileHandle`) and with either `FileOptions.Asynchronous` or `useAsync = true`, the resulting file handle in .NET reports its asynchronous capability via `.IsAsync == true`.

- **Linux File Descriptor Flags**: However, upon further inspection using the Linux `fcntl` system call with `F_GETFL`, the handle does not show the typical Linux async flags such as `O_ASYNC` or `O_NONBLOCK`, which are indicators of asynchronous or non-blocking I/O at the OS level.

- **Observed Behavior**: The resulting handle appears identical to one opened for synchronous I/O. This observation could suggest that, in practice, the underlying Linux implementation may not set kernel-level async flags, even though .NET reports async capabilities.

- **Implications**: Developers relying on .NET's async file I/O on Linux might not be truly getting kernel-accelerated asynchronous behavior, perhaps getting thread-based or emulated async semantics instead.

- **Discussion Source**: The discussion was initiated in a Reddit thread by the user [FergoTheGreat](https://www.reddit.com/user/FergoTheGreat), raising questions for investigation or clarification by the .NET community.

### Additional Notes

- This question is particularly relevant for high-performance applications or those relying on true Linux async characteristics for I/O scalability.
- Further research or official .NET documentation review may be needed to understand the complete picture.
