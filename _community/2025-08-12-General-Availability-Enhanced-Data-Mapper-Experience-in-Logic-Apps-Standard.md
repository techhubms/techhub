# General Availability: Enhanced Data Mapper Experience in Logic Apps (Standard)

**Author:** shahparth

We are pleased to announce the general availability (GA) of the redesigned Data Mapper UX within the Azure Logic Apps (Standard) extension for Visual Studio Code. This release marks a significant step toward modernizing and optimizing data transformation workflows for integration developers working with Microsoft's cloud integration tools.

## What's New

- **Default UX Upgrade:** The new Data Mapper user experience, previously in public preview, is now the default in the Logic Apps Standard extension for VS Code.
- **Customer-Driven Improvements:** Feedback from the integration developer community has led to the resolution of several critical issues:
  - **Opening V1 Maps in V2:** Users can now open and edit older maps, taking advantage of enhanced visual capabilities.
  - **macOS Schema Loading:** Stability and crash issues when loading schemas on Mac have been fixed.
  - **Function Documentation Updates:** Comprehensive guidance and improved examples for built-in collection functions, especially with repeating nodes.

## Whatâ€™s Coming Next

Looking forward, the Logic Apps team is planning several new features:

- **Smart Mapping:** Schema-aware recommendations will accelerate mapping and reduce manual configuration.
- **Root Node Selection:** The ability to select any node from referenced schemas as the mapping root.
- **Flat File Schema Support:** Native handling of CSV files in Logic Apps mapping scenarios.

## Stay Connected

Feedback on real-world usage scenarios and requests for missing features is welcome. Users are encouraged to provide suggestions or report issues via [this feedback form](https://aka.ms/mapper-feedback).

## Additional Information
