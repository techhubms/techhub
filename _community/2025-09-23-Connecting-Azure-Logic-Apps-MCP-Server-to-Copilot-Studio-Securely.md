KentWeareMSFT demonstrates how to set up a secure connection from Copilot Studio to a Logic Apps MCP Server, using Azure Logic Apps and API Center to unlock enterprise data for conversational AI agents.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Connecting Azure Logic Apps MCP Server to Copilot Studio Securely

In this post, KentWeareMSFT details the process for configuring a secure and efficient integration between Azure Logic Apps MCP Server and Copilot Studio. This integration is designed to unlock enterprise data for agentic conversational solutions using Microsoft's latest platform capabilities.

## Why Azure Logic Apps?

Azure Logic Apps Standard is recommended for building MCP Servers due to its:

- **Strong Security Posture:** Supports Entra ID authentication (EasyAuth), enabling enterprise-level authorization and authentication.
- **Single Tenant Offering:** Dedicated compute, storage, and networking per customer.
- **Managed Identity Integration:** Secure connections to Azure resources without requiring keys or secrets.
- **Rich Connector Library:** Over 1400 supported connectors for both cloud SaaS and high-throughput on-premises scenarios, avoiding the need for an on-premises gateway.

## Key Services Used

1. **API Center:** A utility for building and governing MCP servers with discoverability features for scaling enterprise integrations. The free tier is sufficient for basic setups.
2. **Logic Apps Standard:** Provides MCP functionality by exposing workflows and connectors as tools.
3. **Copilot Studio:** Enables conversational AI scenarios, acting as a consumer of the Logic Apps MCP Server.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Build the Logic Apps MCP Server:**
   - Use API Center for a wizard-driven setup and organizational governance.
   - Note: API Center is optional; direct setup is also possible.
2. **App Registration:**
   - An Azure App Registration will be created during the process.
   - Retrieve necessary registration details and apply required changes for security and connectivity.
3. **Integrate with Copilot Studio:**
   - Register the MCP Server within Copilot Studio.
   - Configure your Copilot Studio agent to call the MCP Server endpoint securely.

## Security Highlights

- Use **Entra ID authentication (EasyAuth)** for enterprise security and SSO capabilities.
- Prefer **Managed Identities** for service-to-service authentication to minimize secrets management.
- Ensure all connections leverage single-tenant Logic Apps for maximum isolation and control.
