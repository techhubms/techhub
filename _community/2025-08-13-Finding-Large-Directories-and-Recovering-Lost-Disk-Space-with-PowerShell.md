# Finding Large Directories and Recovering Lost Disk Space with PowerShell

Author: LainRobertson

## Overview

When disk space mysteriously vanishes on Windows, GUI tools exist to helpâ€”but for automation and repeatable troubleshooting, PowerShell shines. This guide walks through using a simple PowerShell module to determine which directories are consuming the most space, leveraging .NET classes for efficiency and resilience.

## XTree.psm1 PowerShell Module

**Key Functions:**

- `Get-DirectorySize`: Calculates the number and total size of files in a single directory.
- `Get-DirectoryTreeSize`: Recursively assesses directories, skipping reparse points to avoid double-counting or misattribution of files.

### Module Code

```powershell
function Get-DirectorySize {
    [cmdletbinding()]
    param(
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)][ValidateNotNull()][string] $Path
    )

    Write-Verbose -Message "Parsing $Path";
    $Summary = [PSCustomObject] @{ Path = $Path.ToLowerInvariant(); Count = 0; Size = 0; }
    [System.IO.Directory]::EnumerateFiles($Path) | ForEach-Object {
        [System.IO.FileInfo]::new(---

            }
        }
    }
    $Stats = Get-DirectorySize -Path $Path;
    $Summary.Count = $Stats.Count;
    $Summary.Size = $Stats.Size;
    $Summary.TotalCount += $Stats.Count;
    $Summary.TotalSize += $Stats.Size;
    $Summary;
}

Export-ModuleMember -Function @("Get-DirectorySize", "Get-DirectoryTreeSize");
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Top Five Consumers by `TotalSize`

Useful for understanding the largest overall subdirectories in a tree:

```powershell
Get-DirectoryTreeSize -Path "D:\Data\Temp\Edge\windows" |
    Sort-Object -Property TotalSize -Descending |
    Select-Object -First 5 |
    Format-Table -AutoSize -Property TotalSize, TotalCount, Path
```

### 2. Top Five Consumers by `Size`

Helps target the largest single directories (excluding nested items):

```powershell
Get-DirectoryTreeSize -Path "D:\Data\Temp\Edge\windows" |
    Sort-Object -Property Size -Descending |
    Select-Object -First 5 |
    Format-Table -AutoSize -Property Size, Count, Path
```

## Why Avoid Reparse Points?

- Avoids double-counting files if they are referenced multiple times.
- Prevents including data from outside the target tree, ensuring accurate metrics.

## Implementation Notes

- Uses `[System.IO.Directory]` for better performance versus `Get-ChildItem`.
- `Get-ChildItem` can throw errors on reparse points; this approach dodges that.
- For illustration: `Get-ChildItem -Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Application Data\";`

## Summary

This approach provides a pragmatic, replicable method for diagnosing disk space issues on Windows systems using PowerShell. By adopting built-in .NET functionality and careful logic around reparse points, it's robust and especially useful for IT pros and developers seeking scriptable answers.
