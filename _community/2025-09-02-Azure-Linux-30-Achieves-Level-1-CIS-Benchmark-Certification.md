# Azure Linux 3.0 Achieves Level 1 CIS Benchmark Certification

Azure Linux 3.0 has officially passed the Level 1 Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks. This achievement strengthens the security and compliance posture for customers running Linux workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## What is the Center for Internet Security (CIS)?

The [Center for Internet Security (CIS)](https://www.cisecurity.org/) is a nonprofit organization focused on developing, validating, and promoting best practices for cyber defense. Their benchmarks and controls are recognized standards drawing on the collective expertise of IT and security professionals.

### What Are CIS Benchmarks?

- **CIS benchmarks** outline configuration baselines and recommended security practices for securely deploying and operating systems.
- They map to important standards such as NIST CSF, NIST SP 800-53, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and more.
- The benchmarks are consensus-driven, with community review at multiple stages.
- **Levels:**
  - **Level 1:** Basic security standards, minimal impact on system availability or performance
  - **Level 2:** Tighter security, may affect some system functionality

## Significance for Azure Linux 3.0 on AKS

- By passing Level 1, Azure Linux 3.0 comes pre-configured with essential security controls.
- This assists organizations in meeting regulatory obligations and protecting against cyber threats without trade-offs in performance or agility.
- Users can deploy Linux applications via AKS clusters confidently, knowing their infrastructure meets robust security baselines out of the box.
- No additional configuration is required; all Azure Linux 3.0 nodes in AKS comply by default.
