In this community post, detroitmatt explores how to make cleanup code reliably run in C# with IAsyncDisposable, highlighting pitfalls with disposable patterns.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Introduction

detroitmatt raises a practical concern about resource cleanup in C#, particularly when using the IAsyncDisposable interface for asynchronous cleanup logic. The question involves ensuring that necessary cleanup code runs reliably, comparing IDisposable and IAsyncDisposable, and observing areas where the C# compiler or runtime might leave gaps.

## The Problem with IDisposable

Traditionally, in C#, implementing the `IDisposable` interface allows objects to release unmanaged or scarce resources. However, this pattern requires consumers of the object to explicitly call `Dispose()`. The most reliable way is via a `using` statement (or declaration), which ensures disposal at the end of scope:

```csharp
using(var resource = new MyResource())
{
    // Use resource
} // Dispose() automatically called here
```

A challenge arises if the object creator or user forgets to use `using`. In that case, the disposal method is never called, leading to potential resource leaks. Moreover, the C# compiler does not emit warnings if objects implementing `IDisposable` are instantiated without `using` or explicit disposal, so mistakes can go unchecked.

## IAsyncDisposable and Asynchronous Cleanup

C# 8.0 introduced the `IAsyncDisposable` interface for types that need to perform asynchronous cleanup. This is useful when, for example, releasing network resources asynchronously:

```csharp
await using(var resource = new MyAsyncResource())
{
    // Use resource
} // DisposeAsync() automatically called here
```

However, similar to `IDisposable`, the callsite must use `await using`, otherwise the cleanup is skipped. There is no compiler-enforced guarantee that cleanup will occur.

## Why Not Finalizers?

A finalizer (destructor) is sometimes used as a last resort for releasing unmanaged resources. However, finalizers are:

- Non-deterministic (run when GC happens, not at a predictable time)
- Synchronous: they cannot handle async operations required by `IAsyncDisposable`
- Potentially costly, causing objects to linger in memory longer, affecting performance

Because `IAsyncDisposable.DisposeAsync` is asynchronous, it's not compatible with standard finalizer logic.

## Is There an "Idiotproof" Way?

detroitmatt asks for a method to ensure that cleanup code *at least attempts* to run, even if not promptly, or if an exception occurs. In managed languages like C#, the patterns rely on correct usage by the developer. Some guidelines include:

- **Document usage requirements:** Make clear in API docs that consumers must use `using` or `await using`
- **Code analyzers:** Use static analyzers or Roslyn analyzers like CA2000 (Dispose objects before losing scope) to catch missed disposals
- **Fallback patterns:** For critical resources, consider implementing both `IDisposable` and a finalizer, but restrict the finalizer to only vital, synchronous resource cleanup
- **Application-wide cleanup:** For certain resources, register for process exit or unhandled exception events (e.g., `AppDomain.ProcessExit`) to perform last-ditch cleanup, acknowledging that async work here is unreliable

## Conclusion

While C# provides patterns for resource management, full guarantees depend on developer discipline or tooling. `IAsyncDisposable` enables async cleanup but lacks automatic enforcement. To improve reliability:

- Always use `using`/`await using`
- Supplement with static analysis
- Document usage
- Consider fallback cleanup, knowing its limits
