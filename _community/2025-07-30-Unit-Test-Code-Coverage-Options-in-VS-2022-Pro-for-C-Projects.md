# Unit Test Code Coverage Options in VS 2022 Pro for C Projects

**Author: jamawg**

Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise includes built-in code coverage, but the Professional edition does not. This poses a challenge for teams wanting code coverage without upgrading to Enterprise. Here’s a summary of the considerations and approaches discussed for obtaining coverage in a C-based project on a Windows pipeline:

## Situation

- Project involves existing C code with a non-Windows target.
- Development preference is Visual Studio (VS) Pro, avoiding the upgrade to Enterprise for budget reasons.
- Need build, static code analysis, unit tests, and code coverage running on Windows pipelines.

## Native (C/C++) Code Coverage Options

1. **MSBuild & MSTest**
   - Used mostly for .NET projects; for native C/C++ code, MSTest integration can be limited.
2. **Alternate Compilers**
   - Consider building with Clang or GCC, both on Windows and cross-compiling as needed.
   - Use `gcov` to collect code coverage when compiling with GCC.
3. **Alternate Project/Build Systems**
   - Converting to a Makefile-based project could open up more options for custom build/test integrations.
4. **Static Analysis**
   - Make use of static analysis tools in the pipeline even if native code coverage options are limited.

## Visual Studio Extensions & Tools

- **Coverlet**: Mainly for .NET projects; not suitable for native C. Helpful mention for those using C# or mixed codebases.
  - [Coverlet GitHub](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet)
- **Fine Code Coverage**: Also geared toward .NET, may not support C code but could be worth investigating further.

## Development Flow Suggestions

- Consider mix-and-match setups: Develop in VS, but build/test outside using CLI tools, Makefiles, or CMake to automate code coverage steps.
- If using Eclipse-based IDEs (from board suppliers), focus on using their CLI tools in build scripts or directly in the CI pipeline, bypassing the IDE UI when possible.

## Takeaways

- **.NET codebases have easier code coverage options in VS Pro via extensions.**
- **Native C/C++ projects require creativity—use alternate compilers and coverage tools, or adjust pipelines for coverage integration.**
- **Community/third-party extensions are improving but not always sufficient for C.**

## Additional Notes

- Be prepared to actively test and possibly troubleshoot third-party extension compatibility for code coverage features.
- Engaging with extension authors and experimenting in test projects can clarify tool limitations.
