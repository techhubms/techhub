hcamposu details the new RabbitMQ Connector for Azure Logic Apps, outlining its features and configuration steps for sending and receiving messages in modern integration solutions.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Introducing RabbitMQ Connector for Azure Logic Apps (Public Preview)

Azure Logic Apps (Standard and Hybrid) now feature a native RabbitMQ Connector, making it possible to seamlessly send and receive messages between your Logic Apps workflows and RabbitMQ, a widely adopted open-source message broker.

## What is RabbitMQ?

RabbitMQ is known for delivering reliable, scalable messaging in various industries, including financial services, IoT, and e-commerce. Its strengths include:

- **Reliability** with strong delivery guarantees
- **Flexible routing** via exchanges (direct, topic, fanout, headers)
- **Clustering and high availability**
- **Easy management and monitoring**
- **Extensibility** (authentication, federation, and plugins)

## Key Features of the Connector

- **Triggers (Receiving Messages):**
  - Use the 'When the queue has messages from RabbitMQ' operation as a trigger in Logic Apps.
  - Peek-lock operations are available for non-destructive reads.
  - Configure by providing the relevant Queue Name.
  - Downstream actions can process or transform the message payload.

- **Publishing Messages:**
  - Select the 'Send a message' operation to publish messages to RabbitMQ, specifying:
    - Queue Name
    - Message Body
    - Exchange Name (optional, for routing)
    - Routing Key
  - Allows integration of asynchronous messaging patterns in your workflows.

- **Completing Messages:**
  - With peek-lock enabled scenarios, use the 'Complete message' action to acknowledge or reject messages.
  - Requires Delivery Tag, Consumer Tag, and an Acknowledgment value (Complete or Reject).

- **Create Queues:**
  - Directly create RabbitMQ queues using the 'Create a queue' action from Logic Apps.

## Hybrid and On-Premises Support

The connector supports hybrid messaging scenarios, allowing on-premises RabbitMQ integration using Logic Apps (Standard) hybrid capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. In the Logic Apps Designer, search for the RabbitMQ connector.
2. Choose the required trigger or action (e.g., When a queue has messages, Send a message, Complete message, Create a queue).
3. Fill in the configuration fields as described above.
4. Use the message payload in downstream Logic Apps actions such as Compose, conditionals, or external calls.

## Supported Regions

Azure is rolling out this connector globally, though some regions may receive it before others.

## Additional Resources

- For demonstrations and configuration walkthroughs, refer to any accompanying video or Azure documentation (video link was not provided in the announcement).
