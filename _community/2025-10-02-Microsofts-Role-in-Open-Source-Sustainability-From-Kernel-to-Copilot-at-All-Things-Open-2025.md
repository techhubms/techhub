# Microsoft's Role in Open-Source Sustainability: From Kernel to Copilot at All Things Open 2025

*By Lachlan Evenson*

The open-source community is facing significant challenges as unpaid maintainers support software critical to our technology infrastructure. Lachlan Evenson, leading Microsoft's open-source strategy, explains how Microsoft is tackling these problems by investing in community health, sponsoring events like All Things Open 2025, and actively contributing code and resources.

## The Open-Source Crisis

- **60% of maintainers are unpaid** and struggling with sustainability
- **58% of maintainers consider quitting** due to burnout
- **90% of enterprises depend on open source**, but corporate investment rarely supports maintainers directly
- Microsoft commits to actively addressing community needs and sustainability

## Microsoft's Open-Source Journey

- Transition from open-source consumer to major contributor
- Investments through GitHub, Azure credits, direct support (e.g., Alpha Omega)
- Projects and technologies: contributions to Linux kernel, CNCF projects, cloud-native platforms

## What’s Happening at All Things Open 2025

### Key Sessions & Themes

- **From Kernel to Copilot: Microsoft's Open-Source Journey to AI at Scale**
    - Examines evolution from Linux contributions to AI-powered services (Copilot, Azure AI, VS Code)
    - Discusses projects like Radius, Dalec, Copacetic
- **Using AI Agents to Empower Application Modernization for Kubernetes**
    - Demonstrates modernizing legacy apps with open-source tools, AI, and reducing skill barriers

### In-Booth Demonstrations

- **Linux on Azure:** How enterprise use drives ecosystem investment
- **AI-Powered Developer Tools:** Automated maintenance for open-source
- **GitHub and Community Programs:** Funding and contributing to OSS projects
- **Security Initiatives:** Automated vulnerability detection and resource provision for maintainers

### Deep-Dive Theater Sessions

- OpenShift on Azure (ARO), Azure Arc, GitOps workflows
- AKS Automatic: Simplified AI app deployment with GitHub and Azure DevOps
- Real-time observability for AI agents via Model Context Protocol (MCP), VS Code, and GitHub Copilot
- VS Code as the open-source AI editor; how to contribute
- GHCP App Modernization tool for rapid Java & .NET upgrades and cloud deployment

## Community Building and The Path Forward

- Emphasizes learning from the community, focusing on sustainable funding models, and collective problem-solving
- Encourages participation at All Things Open 2025 for idea exchange and collaboration
