In this post, Kralizek82 explores methods to test protected endpoints in C# applications using fake JWT tokens, providing practical guidance for .NET developers.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Introduction

Testing API endpoints that require JWT-based authentication often presents challenges for developers. In this blog post, Kralizek82 discusses practical ways to test protected endpoints by generating and using fake JWT tokens within C#/.NET projects.

## Why Use Fake JWTs for Testing?

When building APIs protected by JWT-based authentication and authorization, it is important to thoroughly test endpoints to ensure correct security implementations. However, relying on production authentication services during testing is inefficient and impractical. Instead, fake JWTs facilitate isolated, repeatable tests by simulating the authentication process.

## General Approach

- Generate fake JWTs with the required claims and structure to mimic valid authentication tokens.
- Inject these tokens into HTTP requests to secured endpoints via test clients or integration test frameworks.
- Validate that endpoints correctly enforce authorization and respond as expected to valid and invalid JWTs.

## Implementing in .NET/C#

1. **Mocking Authentication Middleware**: Configure authentication middleware in test environments to accept any JWT with the necessary claims, or to use specific keys for signing fake tokens.
2. **Creating Fake Tokens**: Use helper libraries like `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt` to create, sign, and verify JWTs programmatically in tests.
3. **Integration Testing**: Incorporate fake JWTs into integration tests for controllers or endpoints, verifying that protected routes are only accessible with appropriate tokens.

## Benefits

- Enables fully autonomous, reproducible testing environments.
- Bypasses external dependencies (identity providers).
- Simplifies testing of various authorization scenarios (different roles/claims).

## Conclusion

Testing protected endpoints with fake JWTs increases developer productivity, test reliability, and code quality. The outlined strategies help .NET developers ensure their authentication and authorization logic behaves as intended during automated test runs.
