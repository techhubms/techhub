LynxV1 discusses a missing 'Enable Copilot' checkbox in Word and PowerPoint, despite holding the correct license, and highlights conflicting information from Microsoft’s documentation and support.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Issue Summary

LynxV1 reports having a Microsoft 365 (M365) Copilot license but observes that the 'Enable Copilot' checkbox is only available in Excel, not in Word or PowerPoint. Despite Copilot functionality being present in all Office apps, the settings option seems inconsistent.

## Details

- **License**: User holds an active M365 Copilot license.
- **Behavior**:
  - The 'Enable Copilot' checkbox appears in Excel's option menu.
  - Not present in Word or PowerPoint.
  - Copilot itself works across all the apps.
- **Documentation vs. Support**:
  - Microsoft’s official documentation claims the checkbox should be available in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.
  - A Microsoft Support agent asserts that the setting is only available in Excel and maintains the documentation is not incorrect, leading to confusion.

## User’s Question

LynxV1 asks the community: Which is accurate—Microsoft’s documentation or the support agent’s statement about office enterprise M365?
