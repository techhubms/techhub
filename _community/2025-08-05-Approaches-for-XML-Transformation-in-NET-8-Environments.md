Authored by technically_a_user, this article delves into practical methods for transforming XML in .NET 8+ systems, comparing XSLT and code-based approaches.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Approaches for XML Transformation in .NET 8+ Environments

Author: technically_a_user

### Scenario Overview

The article presents a scenario involving:

- One internal XSD schema and multiple external XSD schemas
- External schemas change 2â€“3 times annually, with varied impact: from renaming elements to complete restructures
- Complex XML messages, only subsets of which are relevant
- Persistent requirement to support the latest two versions of the external schemas
- Complex transformation logic, often involving optional/shared elements
- No paid packages allowed for implementation

### Central Questions

- How should XML transformations be handled in a .NET 8+ environment under these constraints?
- Is XSLT a suitable, maintainable solution, or should XML be parsed into classes and handled in code?
- How can maintainable, robust test coverage be ensured as schemas frequently change?

### Considerations

#### 1. XSLT

- **Pros**: Declarative, designed for XML-to-XML transformations, widely supported
- **Cons**: Can become unmanageable as transformations grow in complexity, harder to test and debug, tools (e.g., Oxygen, VSCode plugins) may not integrate well with larger .NET development workflows

#### 2. Code-Based Transformation (C#)

- **Approach**: Parse incoming XML into strongly-typed C# classes (e.g., with XmlSerializer or System.Xml.Linq)
- **Transformation**: Implement procedural logic to convert objects to the internal schema
- **Testing**: Easier integration with standard .NET testing frameworks (e.g., xUnit, NUnit), enabling maintainable and granular tests
- **Maintainability**: C# code benefits from refactoring tools, better debugging, and familiar IDE features
- **Challenges**: More upfront work to map schemas and maintain classes as external schemas evolve

#### 3. Testing Strategy

- Use automated tests targeting isolated transformation logic
- Mock or generate sample XML payloads for different schema versions
- Focus on modular design for ease of updates & minimizing regression risk

### Author's Perspective

The author expresses skepticism toward the maintainability of XSLT, highlighting difficulties in navigation, reasoning, and effective use of IDE tooling. They suggest a more code-centric approach (parsing to objects, transforming in code) may offer greater maintainability and testability in this context.

### Summary Table

| Method          | Maintainability | Tooling (for .NET) | Testability      |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| XSLT            | Low-Medium     | Mixed/External     | Moderate        |
| C# Transformation | Medium-High   | Excellent          | Excellent       |

### Conclusion

For .NET 8+ projects with evolving, complex XML transformation needs and a strong emphasis on testability and maintainability, code-based transformations in C# appear preferable to XSLT, despite higher initial development investment. Automated testing and thoughtful modularization further support maintainability as schemas evolve.
