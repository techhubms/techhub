# MCC Phantom Install on Windows Server 2022 with WSL

**Author:** jjmehren

## Overview

This post documents the process and associated logs for installing Microsoft Connected Cache (MCC) on a Windows Server 2022 host, utilizing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and Ubuntu 24.04. Despite reaching a "success" state according to installation tasks and logs, running `wsl --list` returns no installed distributions. The post provides stepwise details for each major installation milestone, hoping to isolate causes of the apparent phantom install.

## Environment

- **Host OS:** Windows Server 2022
- **Linux Distro:** Ubuntu 24.04 (imported as VHDX)
- **WSL Status:** Fully updated (WSL, kernel)

## Installation Steps and Diagnostic Output

### 1. Initialization

- MCC installer invoked via scheduled task.
- VHDX file existence/size verified: `c:\mccwsl02\Ubuntu-24.04-Mcc-Converted.vhdx`
- VHDX accessible for import: **size** 132,074,438,656 bytes.

### 2. Image Import

- Image import claimed successful: MCC Ubuntu image imported to WSL.
- Validation step shows WSL Ubuntu image detected and running, with IP recorded as `System.Object[]` (suggests serialization or logging issue).

### 3. Port Proxy Setup

- Port 80 forwarding to WSL instance completed with `netsh interface portproxy`.

### 4. Command Execution & Container Management

- Install commands run inside Ubuntu WSL Distro
- MCC container (pulled from Azure Container Registry):
    - `msconnectedcacheprod1.azurecr.io/mcc/linux/iot/mcc-ubuntu-iot-amd64:2.0.0.2112_e`
  - Container startup detected, confirmed with status code 200.

### 5. Directory, Symlink, and gMSA Account Handling

- Certificates and log directories created at `c:\mccwsl02\Certificates` and subfolders.
- Symlinks set inside the WSL instance: `windowsCerts -> /mnt/c/mccwsl02/Certificates`
- Config file verification successful. All steps reported as OK.
- WSL distribution checks reference:
    - `Ubuntu-24.04-Mcc-Base`
    - `Ubuntu-24.04-Mcc`
- All properties for TLS and symlink infrastructure report as True/Success.

### 6. Finalization & Cleanup

- Last validation steps and PowerShell transcript confirm successful install, no error messages.
- **However:** `wsl --list` returns no distributions, and the original issue remains unresolved.

## Additional Diagnostics

- The `wslip.txt` file only outputs: `System.Object[] COMPLETED` (not human-readable).
- All other logs appear clean, suggesting either a registration or visibility issue inside WSL's distribution table.

## Recommendations

- Re-run `wsl.exe --list --verbose` to confirm current WSL state.
- Check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages` for the Ubuntu/MCC distro, and review logon context.
- Try manual import via `wsl --import` if necessary.
- Validate that the gMSA account used has sufficient permissions and is properly mapped.
- Investigate custom installation parameters or scheduled task constraints.

By tracing each phase from VHDX verification through symlink and container setup, this log aids troubleshooting situations where the installer claims success but `wsl --list` yields no evident distributions. Double-check import logs, permission boundaries, and installation contexts for further resolution.
