# Kickstart Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra: Free Starter Pack with Policies & Automation

Conditional Access (CA) is a core component of the Zero Trust security model in Microsoft Entra ID. This post introduces a free starter pack designed to help organizations implement CA quickly and safely, without risking productivity or accidentally locking out administrators.

## What's Included

- **Policy Templates (JSON):** Pre-defined Conditional Access policies, including blocking legacy authentication and requiring MFA for privileged accounts.
- **PowerShell Deployment Scripts:** Scripts to deploy CA policies via Microsoft Graph, export existing policies, and toggle report-only mode.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow:** Enables CI/CD automation for policy deployment.
- **Safety-Focused Documentation:** Usage guides and a checklist to ensure careful, non-disruptive rollout.

## Why Use Conditional Access?

- Block legacy authentication to reduce vulnerabilities.
- Enforce MFA for administrators for enhanced security.
- Require compliant devices and MFA for high-risk sign-ins.
- Validate new policies with report-only mode before enforcing them organization-wide.

## How To Get Started

1. **Download the Repository**  
   Access the resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/soaeb7007/entra-ca-starter-pack).
2. **Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK**  

   ```powershell
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess','Directory.Read.All'
   Select-MgProfile -Name beta
   ```

3. **Deploy Policies in Report-Only Mode**  

   ```powershell
   ./scripts/deploy-conditional-access.ps1 -PolicyPath ./policies -ReportOnly
   ```

4. **Validate Impact**  
   Review the Sign-in logs to verify how policies would affect users and services before enforcement.

## Safe Rollout Best Practices

- Always exclude break-glass accounts from CA policies.
- Start with report-only mode and validate for 48â€“72 hours.
- Pilot new policies with a small group before organization-wide rollout.

## Next Steps

- Enable report-only mode for all new policies.
- Explore Microsoft Entra portal Conditional Access templates for further customization.
- Stay tuned for upcoming content on optimizing Conditional Access for performance and security.
