# Enterprise-Ready RBAC Model for Azure AI Landing Zone

**Author:** Madhur_Shukla

## Overview

This blueprint defines an enterprise-ready access governance and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) model for Azure AI Landing Zones. It focuses on secure enablement of AI, ML, and data services while following best practices such as least privilege, segregation of duties, and strict environment guardrails.

---

## Governance Principles

- **Least Privilege:** Only required permissions are granted per role.
- **Segregation of Duties (SoD):** Distinct permissions for building, deploying, operating, and securing workloads.
- **Environment Guardrails:**
  - **Dev:** Open for experimentation.
  - **Nonprod:** Controlled integration and validation.
  - **Prod:** No human write access; CI/CD-only with PIM Just-in-Time access as exception.
- **Identity Strategy:**
  - Managed Identities for workloads.
  - Service Principals for pipeline automation.
  - PIM for human elevation.
  - Break-glass accounts for emergencies only.

### Key Benefits

- Aligns security to enterprise and regulator needs.
- Defines accountability by persona and environment.
- Maintains consistent control-plane and data-plane access.
- Enforces operational guardrails (cost, compliance, and security).

---

- Azure Machine Learning (Workspaces)
- Azure AI Search
- Azure AI Services / OpenAI
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure App Service / Functions

## Custom Role Example: AzureML Limited Compute Operator

```json
{
  "Name": "AzureML Limited Compute Operator",
  "IsCustom": true,
  "Description": "Operate ML compute (start/stop/attach/detach) without workspace admin actions.",
  "Actions": [
    "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/read",
    "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/read",
    "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/computes/*/action"
  ],
  "NotActions": [
    "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/delete",
    "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/update"
  ],
  "DataActions": [],
  "NotDataActions": []
}
```

---

## Identities and Automation

- **Managed Identity:** For workloads (AML jobs, Functions, Container Apps) in prod.
- **Service Principal:** For pipeline deployments. Rotate secrets, use FIC when possible.
- **Break-glass Accounts:** For emergencies only. Excluded from strong CA/MFA for controlled use.
- **PIM:** For human elevation, time-bound with approval and justification.

---

## Entra ID Group Naming Guidance

- Short and long naming conventions for assignable roles (e.g., `ai-ds-dev`, `grp-ai-ds-<project>-dev`).
- Recommended to group by persona and environment for clarity and scale.

---

## Governance Workflows

- Access requests via ITSM/Access Packages (Entra ID).
- Pipeline/GitHub Actions/Terraform for deployments (approval gates, automation).
- PIM JIT elevation and strict recertification for human roles.
