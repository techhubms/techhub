# Understanding GitHub Copilot Usage Quotas and Agent Mode Requests

**Author:** ogpterodactyl

This post discusses GitHub Copilot request limits—especially in Agent Mode—and clarifies how different actions, edits, and models like GPT-4.1 and Sonnet 4 affect quotas for developers and organizations.

## Key Questions and Points Raised

- **Unlimited Chat with GPT-4.1?**
  - Inquiry into whether GPT-4.1 chat is unlimited in Copilot, compared to quota-restricted scenarios with other models.

- **Do Copilot Edits Count as Agent Mode?**
  - The user asks whether edits made via Copilot are billed as Agent Mode requests or counted differently.
  - Curiosity about the impact of context (number of files, @workspace or #codebase tags).

- **How are Prompts Counted?**
  - Quoting from [Copilot's official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests):
    > Each prompt you make in Agent Mode is counted as a premium request when using premium models, regardless of how many tools it calls, how many edits it makes, or the size of the context you provide.

- **Examples for Request Counting:**
  - A single instruction—even if it covers multiple tasks—counts as one request.
  - e.g., “Add unit tests for X, Y, and Z modules” = 1 request, despite the workload.
  - Multiple prompts result in multiple requests.

- **Exploring Limits**
  - The author plans to reach quota limits experimentally to observe the behavior when limits are hit, and wonders about subscription options and upgrades.

- **Aspirations for Free Model Upgrades**
  - Hopes for improvements in the free-tier model in the future.

## Summary

This post helps clarify Copilot's quota system:

- Premium Agent Mode requests are counted per prompt, not by the number of tools or code edits invoked.
- Context size and tags (@workspace, #codebase) do not influence the request count.
- Latest model (GPT-4.1) may allow unlimited chat, but premium actions use quota.
- Quantitative testing and further exploration by users may reveal additional behaviors.
