In this brief user report, iammultiman discusses a frustrating change in recent versions of Visual Studio Code related to GitHub Copilot's user experience. <!--excerpt_end--> Previously, when using GitHub Copilot in VSCode, users could individually close or remove files listed as changed by Copilot via a conveniently located 'X' button. Following a recent update, this 'X' option has disappeared. This change notably impacts developer workflowsâ€”especially when the growing file list encroaches on the Copilot chat window, making the interface less manageable and potentially reducing productivity. The author highlights this missing feature and seeks community feedback or solutions. The report underscores the importance of small UI elements in maintaining a smooth development process, and suggests a need for either a fix, a workaround, or better change communication from extension developers.
