## Logic Apps - Exporting to VS Code and CI/CD Challenges

**Author:** your-lost-elephant

Azure Logic Apps is a helpful tool for creating quick integrations, especially when you need to automate tasks like sending emails or processing data between systems. The author notes frequent use of Logic Apps for these quick scenarios.

However, a recurring challenge is the difficulty in adopting standard development practices with Logic Appsâ€”particularly integration with source code management and automated deployments via CI/CD pipelines. The process of exporting the logic app content to a zip file does not seem straightforward, even when working with only a basic workflow such as sending an email.

Another issue is the inability to load the exported logic app in the designer, making local development and iteration cumbersome. This limits the usability of Logic Apps to quick, one-off projects and makes it less effective for workflows that demand proper versioning, collaboration, or repeated deployments through standardized DevOps practices.

The author queries the community seeking improved ways to manage Logic Apps as source code, deploy them through CI/CD, and open them reliably in Visual Studio Code.

> "It seems like a neat tool but if I can't get it working locally and store it as source code it limits my options and would only be useful for like quick one off things. Anyone got any better experiences with it?"

The post reflects on the trade-offs and limitations experienced, and looks for advice or better practices from others who may have managed to fit Logic Apps into a more traditional code-driven development workflow.
