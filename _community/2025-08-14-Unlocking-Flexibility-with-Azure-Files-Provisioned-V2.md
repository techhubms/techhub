# Unlocking Flexibility with Azure Files Provisioned V2

**Host:** Pierre Roman
**Guest:** Will Gries, Principal PM, Azure Storage

Azure Files Provisioned V2 marks a significant evolution in Microsoft's cloud storage solutions, much to the benefit of both new and seasoned Azure users. In this episode of *E2E:10-Minute Drill*, Pierre Roman explores with Will Gries how this updated billing and performance model enables a far greater degree of control and predictability for cloud storage infrastructure.

## What Has Changed?

Previously, Azure Files offered a pay-as-you-go model (transaction-based) and a Premium (Provisioned V1) tier that sometimes required over-provisioning storage to meet IOPS needs. This could result in unpredictable costs and wasted resources.

**Provisioned V2** changes the paradigm with:

- The ability to provision storage, IOPS, and throughput *independently*.
- A stable, predictable monthly bill based solely on what you reserve—**no more per-operation fees**.
- No need to over-buy storage just to get higher performance.

## Key Benefits

- **Cost Predictability:** Users pay a known rate each month based on their reserved resources. This reduces bill surprises, even with fluctuating access patterns. Microsoft notes average cost reductions of 30–50% for active workloads relative to previous models.
- **Performance Scalability:** Each share can now reach up to 50,000 IOPS and 5 GiB/sec throughput, supporting up to 256 TiB. You can dynamically adjust these parameters as needed—or even burst above your baseline for short intervals.
- **Simplified Management:** Eliminates Hot, Cool, Transaction Optimized tiers—plan and budget with new per-share metrics and right-size your configuration. This is particularly advantageous for hybrid scenarios using Azure File Sync.

## Why Shift to Provisioned V2?

- Avoid over-provisioning and unpredictable variable charges.
- Manage high-throughput, large-scale workloads or frequent access scenarios efficiently.
- Improved transparency for IT budgeting and capacity planning.

## Real World Example

> *A healthcare company with unpredictable spikes in access for medical images can now pre-provision exactly the throughput and storage needed, stay within budget, and use burst IOPS to handle peak loads without reconfiguring or incurring surprise transaction fees.*

## Conclusion

Provisioned V2 makes Azure Files a more enterprise-ready, cost-effective storage solution for dynamic workloads of all sizes. Whether optimizing hybrid storage strategies or modernizing legacy file sharing, this upgrade delivers both financial and operational control.
