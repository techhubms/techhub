kenieva introduces Azure Service Groups, now in public preview. This Azure feature allows flexible grouping and monitoring of resources at the tenant level, offering low-privilege management with support for varied hierarchies.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Announcing Public Preview for Azure Service Groups!

Azure has introduced **Service Groups (SGs)**, a new resource container available for all Azure customers. Service Groups enhance flexibility in grouping, managing, and observing resources spread across the Azure tenant.

## What are Service Groups?

Service Groups are tenant-level resources that enable new management and observability scenarios, especially where resource membership and hierarchy need to be dynamic. Unlike other containers, Service Groups operate independently of tenant-wide RBAC or Policy features, meaning their access model is isolated from broader organizational permissions.

## Key Features

- **Low Privilege Management:** Designed to operate with minimal permissions, Service Groups let users manage resources without elevated access, appealing to a broad set of users and scenarios. Membership in a Service Group does not transfer RBAC or policy assignments.
- **Flexible Membership and Nested Hierarchies:** Resources from anywhere in your Azure tenant can be added to one or multiple service groups. Service Groups can also be nested, enabling multi-dimensional hierarchies based on cost centers, products, organizations, and more.
- **Monitoring and Observability:** Azure Monitor features, such as [Health Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/health-models/overview), are integrated, allowing you to troubleshoot, investigate, and monitor the health of Service Groups.

## When to Use Service Groups

Service Groups are most useful in environments where resources span across different management containers, leading to complexity in observation and control. Use Service Groups to:

- Model application or service hierarchies that don't fit existing Azure containers
- Enable targeted monitoring and organizational reporting across arbitrary scopes
- Enhance visibility without incurring broad permission changes

Limitations: Service Groups are not deployment scopes and cannot be used to assign RBAC or Azure Policy.

## Getting Started

- **Via REST API:** [Quickstart Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/create-service-group-rest-api)
- **Azure Portal:** [Service Groups Management](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Resources/ServiceGroupsBrowse.ReactView)
- **Documentation:** [Service Groups Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/overview)

## FAQ

**Do Service Groups replace existing Azure groups?**
> No. They are designed to work in parallel with current containers like Management Groups or Resource Groups. See the [scenario comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/service-groups/overview#scenario-comparison) for details.

**Who can create Service Groups?**
> Anyone with a valid Azure user account in a Microsoft Entra directory.

**Why tenant-level?**
> To support cross-tenant membership, enabling global resource grouping without granting broad tenant access. Unlike Management Groups, Service Groups do not provide users with wide-ranging rights.
