# What Senior Engineers Earning 150k+ Work On: Tech and Business Realities

By Legitimate-School-59

This candid community reflection explores the day-to-day responsibilities of senior engineers and architects working in large enterprises with complex Microsoft-centric stacks. Below is a breakdown of recurring technical and business tasks based on real-world experience:

## Core Technical Tasks

- **Azure Security and Networking**: Segmenting Azure infrastructure into new VNets for improved security, carefully avoiding disruptions to production applications.
- **ETL and Data Processing Architecture**:
  - Building new Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes for more robust data consumption.
  - Migrating from legacy SSIS packages to modern solutions like Azure Data Factory, Logic Apps, and Azure Functions, plus Snowflake for analytics.
- **Application and Codebase Modernization**:
  - Large-scale React app redesign.
  - Gradual migration from numerous small git repositories to a consolidated monorepo setup, resolving dependency problems (notably “10 years of NuGet artifact hell”).
  - Upgrading the codebase to .NET 9 ecosystem-wide.
- **Software Maintenance and Review**:
  - Ongoing pull request reviews, code cherry-picking for releases, and managing the branching strategy.
  - Maintaining institutional C# backend services and performing frequent upgrades.
- **Documentation and Onboarding**:
  - Creating detailed manuals for developer onboarding, environment setup, and branching strategies.

## Typical Business & Organizational Challenges

- **Meetings and Review Overheads**:
  - High frequency of meetings, grooming sessions, architecture calls, and collaborative decision reviews.
  - Pull request reviews and internal communications are flagged as notable time sinks.
- **Management and Coordination**:
  - Managing people, fielding stakeholder requests, and acting as a liaison between business and technical decision-makers.
  - “Telling people above me to not make stupid decisions”—illustrating the challenge of influencing technical direction from within.
- **Resource Constraints & Deadlines**:
  - Constantly juggling resource allocation, deadlines, and the expectation to “find hours that don’t exist” for urgent development work.
- **Legacy Systems and Vendor Software**:
  - Maintenance and troubleshooting of institutional and vendor software, with humorous references to outdated tech and arcane error messages.

## Roles Held

- Enterprise Architect
- Development Manager
- DevOps
- “Professional puck passer” (tongue-in-cheek title for dealing with internal bureaucracy)

## Representative Technologies & Concepts

- Azure: Virtual Networks, Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Azure Data Factory
- .NET (specifically migrating to .NET 9)
- DevOps: Monorepo migrations, NuGet management, Git branching, release management
- Data Platforms: SQL Server, Snowflake, legacy SSIS
- Frontend: React
- Security: Network segmentation, application security improvements

## Common Themes

- Frustration with business processes and resource allocation
- Technical debt accumulation and cleanup initiatives
- Emphasis on pragmatism and problem-solving under real-world constraints
- Centrality of Microsoft technologies in enterprise-scale engineering
