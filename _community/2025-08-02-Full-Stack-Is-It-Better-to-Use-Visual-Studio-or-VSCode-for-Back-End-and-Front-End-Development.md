In this post, RankedMan raises key questions for full-stack developers about IDE choices (Visual Studio vs. VSCode) for backend and frontend work, as well as preferences for organizing code repositories.<!--excerpt_end-->

### Summary

This article, posted by RankedMan, asks the developer community for their perspective on two common full-stack engineering challenges:

1. **IDE Preferences**: Whether it's preferable to use a single IDE (Visual Studio 2022) for both backend and frontend development or to use Visual Studio for backend (.NET) and VSCode for frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript) work. The author describes a previous workflow where both backend (ASP.NET) and frontend (TypeScript) coexisted in a single Visual Studio solution, noting issues encountered due to this approach. The concern is raised that Visual Studio may not offer the best production experience for JS/TS projects.

2. **Repository Organization**: Whether backend and frontend codebases should be organized in separate GitHub repositories (each with their own README and structure) or combined into a single monorepo with distinct frontend and backend folders.

### Insights from the Discussion

- **IDE Integration**: Many developers lean towards using Visual Studio for backend work (especially for .NET-based applications) due to its robust tooling, debugging features, and integration with Microsoft technologies. For frontend development (modern JavaScript frameworks, TypeScript, etc.), VSCode is often preferred because it offers lightweight, flexible, and more customizable support, with a strong ecosystem for web development extensions.
- **Potential Issues with Full Integration**: Integrating both backend and frontend entirely within Visual Studio may lead to friction, as Visual Studio is not optimized for contemporary JS/TS workflows. VSCode, in contrast, natively supports web development scenarios and is more performant for large-scale JavaScript projects.

- **Monorepo vs. Multirepo**: The choice between a single repository or multiple repositories depends on factors such as team structure, deployment environments, and project complexity. A monorepo (single repository) can simplify coordinated changes and dependency management, making local development and CI/CD pipelines more straightforward. However, separate repositories can provide clearer separation of concerns, enable independent versioning, and accommodate teams working on decoupled services or products.

### Practical Takeaways

- Evaluate your team's expertise and the demands of your technology stack before choosing an IDE for frontend/backend work.
- Consider the scale and independence of your backend and frontend when deciding between monorepo or multirepo repository structures.
- Be aware of the limitations and strengths of each toolâ€”Visual Studio excels with .NET, while VSCode shines with JS/TS.

### Conclusion

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to these questions. Your IDE and repository choices should reflect your team's workflow, the technical requirements of your stack, and maintainability priorities.
