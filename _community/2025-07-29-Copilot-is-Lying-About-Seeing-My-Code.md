KingPvzYT shares their doubts about GitHub Copilot's privacy claims after Copilot seemed to reference their exact code. This article delves into the experience and questions raised around code context and transparency.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Article Summary

In this community post, KingPvzYT discusses a suspicious experience using GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio. Initially, the author had asked Copilot whether it could see their code, and Copilot responded that it could not. Later, while seeking help for a bug, Copilot provided a suggestion that closely matched the author's actual code, even though the author had explicitly rewritten parts of it.

### Sequence of Events

- **Initial Query:** The author asked Copilot if it had access to their code and was told it did not, which the author accepted as true at the time.
- **Bug Encounter:** While attempting to fix a bug involving element IDs and event handlers in JavaScript, the author rewrote Copilot's previous solution and added exception handling.
- **Surprising Suggestion:** After reporting that Copilot's solution was incorrect, Copilot responded with a code replacement that precisely matched the code the author had written, not its own earlier suggestion.
- **Further Interaction:** Copilot continued to provide feedback and criticism about the author's own code, suggesting a level of contextual awareness that contradicted its earlier claim about not seeing user code.

### The Authorâ€™s Skepticism

KingPvzYT confronted Copilot about the apparent contradiction, only to receive a standard response denying code access: Copilot claimed its suggestions were based on common patterns and past experience but did not directly access the user's code.

The author expresses deep skepticism about this explanation, finding it too coincidental for Copilot to have recreated the exact code block without having seen it, especially since the previous Copilot suggestions were quite different.

## Key Discussion Points

- **Code Privacy:** The post raises concerns about user privacy when using AI-powered coding assistants like Copilot.
- **Pattern Recognition vs. Code Access:** It questions whether Copilot truly only suggests code based on common patterns, or if it leverages more direct contextual cues from the user's current session or files.
- **Transparency and Trust:** The incident highlights the need for transparency in how AI tools access and process user data.

## Conclusion

KingPvzYT's experience sheds light on the gray area between AI pattern recognition and actual code access, leading to important questions for Copilot users concerning privacy and trust. The post encourages further scrutiny of Copilot's inner workings and the assurances provided regarding code visibility and suggestion generation.
