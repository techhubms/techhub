# Azure AI Technical Blogs Consolidate into Azure AI Foundry Blog

Azure AI technical blogs have been consolidated into a single destination, the [Azure AI Foundry Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry), to simplify how developers and technical professionals access news, tutorials, and updates around Microsoft's AI platforms and services.

## What’s Changed

- **Consolidation:** Multiple technical blogs—AI Platform Blog, Azure AI Services Blog, and Azure Machine Learning Blog—are now combined into the Azure AI Foundry Blog.
- **Unified Experience:** All technical Azure AI content is accessible in one place, providing streamlined news, tutorials, and announcements for AI practitioners.

## Seamless Access to Past Content

- **Legacy Content Migrated:** Existing posts from previous blog archives have been moved to the new Azure AI Foundry Blog, and links to older content will redirect to the correct new destination.
- **Preserved Bookmarks:** Saved links will continue to work; redirects ensure users can locate legacy resources without disruption.

## Subscription Information

- **Subscriptions Not Transferred:** Followers from previous blogs must re-subscribe to the new Azure AI Foundry Blog. Email and RSS subscriptions from the legacy platforms did not automatically carry over.
- **Action Required:** Users should visit the [Azure AI Foundry Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry) homepage and use the Follow button to continue receiving updates.

## Looking Ahead

- This consolidation aims to deliver a more unified, comprehensive experience, highlighting how various Azure AI tools and services work together.
- The blog will continue delivering technical content, best practices, and community insights for practitioners building AI solutions on Azure.
