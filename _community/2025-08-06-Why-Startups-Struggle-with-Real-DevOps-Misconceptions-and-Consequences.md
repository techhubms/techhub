title: "Why Startups Struggle with Real DevOps: Misconceptions and Consequences"
description: "This community discussion, led by Pichipaul, dives into the pitfalls early-stage startups face when approaching DevOps. It highlights how many teams want sophisticated deployment and infrastructure setups (CI/CD, IaC, monitoring, etc.) without understanding the financial, organizational, and cultural investment required. Topics include misplaced responsibilities, tech debt, lack of accountability, underbudgeting, and the dangers of superficial DevOps adoption. The thread also notes the need for platform engineering and a company-wide DevOps mindset, rather than relegating it to a single “hero” or as an afterthought."

# Why Startups Struggle with Real DevOps: Misconceptions and Consequences

**Author:** Pichipaul

## Summary

Many early-stage startups express a desire for DevOps practices—CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, rollbacks, and zero-downtime deployments—often well before generating stable revenue. Teams frequently assign these responsibilities to solo developers or junior engineers, treating DevOps as a minor ‘side task’ instead of a foundational engineering discipline.

## Key Pain Points

- Lack of true ownership or budget for infrastructure and tooling
- Developers pressured to add features instead of investing in technical debt reduction
- DevOps blamed for production issues, regardless of underlying causes
- Superficial approaches (e.g., simply ‘plugging in’ CI/CD YAML files) without architectural foresight
- No roadmap, accountability, or funding for platform/infra as a core product
- Tech and operations debt compound over time, resulting in team burnout and scaling challenges

## Organizational Challenges

- Startups see infrastructure roles as non-essential until forced to scale
- Platform/DevOps work expected from under-experienced staff or as overwork
- Poorly architected infrastructure ballooning costs and complexity once a business grows
- Compliance concerns (SOX, SOC2) suddenly prioritized late in a company’s lifecycle, leading to last-minute scrambles
- Dangers of scaling without a future-focused (not just ‘current needs’) infrastructure plan
- “Spray some DevOps on it” mentality mirrors superficial Agile adoption

## Culture and Mindset

- Real DevOps is a long-term, company-wide investment
- Needs leadership buy-in, resourcing, and shared responsibility—not a “hero” role for a single engineer
- Platform engineering and developer experience (‘devex’) should be considered from the outset
- Without this, infra/process become bottlenecks as teams and requirements expand

## Community Reflections

- AI and automation are sometimes proposed as shortcuts, but do not replace core DevOps investments
- Managers and leadership may lack understanding of required technical depth
- Early under-investment often leads to painful, expensive refactoring or crisis-mode hiring later

## Takeaways

- DevOps success hinges on cultural change, adequate budgeting, and mature workflows
- Early and realistic planning around infra and processes helps avoid severe tech debt and operational risk down the line
- Building for scale means considering more than “what works today”—future needs and compliance must be engineered in
