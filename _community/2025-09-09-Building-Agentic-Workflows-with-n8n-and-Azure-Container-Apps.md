# Building Agentic Workflows with n8n and Azure Container Apps

When you need to connect disparate systems and automate tasks, [n8n](https://n8n.io/) offers a flexible workflow engine with a strong community behind it. With hundreds of integrations and ready-to-share workflows, n8n is a popular tool for orchestrating data, APIs, and even AI-driven scenarios.

Running n8n on Azure combines this extensibility with enterprise-grade infrastructure. Using **Azure Container Apps (ACA)**, you can deploy n8n in a managed, scalable fashion, and integrate AI features directly using **Azure OpenAI Service** and Azure Foundry’s OpenAI models.

## Why n8n on Azure?

- **Community workflows**: Quickly get started using pre-built automation templates from the n8n ecosystem.
- **AI built-in**: Integrate natural language, summarization, and reasoning with Azure-powered AI models.
- **Managed scale**: Azure Container Apps enable fully managed, container-native deployments including scaling, networking, and security.
- **Deployment flexibility**: Move from prototyping to production with the same template and best practices.

## Three Deployment Scenarios

Using the provided [Azure deployment template](https://github.com/simonjj/n8n-on-aca), you can choose one of three setups based on your needs:

1. **Try**: Instantly spin up n8n for experimentation and integration with Azure OpenAI—ideal for proofs of concept.
2. **Small**: Add persistence and private networking for small teams or department-scale use, maintaining your workflows and data across sessions.
3. **Production**: Achieve resilience and scalability for mission-critical deployments, adding features like multi-instance scaling and enhanced security.

## Infusing Workflows with AI

Once n8n is live on Azure, you can plug Azure OpenAI models into workflows, enabling:

- Automated content generation
- Intelligent routing and decision logic
- Summarization of large or complex data
- AI-driven customer engagement

Combining n8n integrations with the reasoning capabilities of Azure OpenAI opens up powerful automation patterns for both developers and business teams.
