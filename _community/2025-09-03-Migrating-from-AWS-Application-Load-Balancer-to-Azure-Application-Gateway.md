# Migrating from AWS Application Load Balancer to Azure Application Gateway

**Author:** Michael_Bender_MS

## Introduction

Azure Application Gateway provides a comprehensive set of features to support enterprise-grade application delivery, security, and performance. Migrating from AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to Azure Application Gateway is a strategic initiative to strengthen cloud architectures and unlock new technical capabilities.

## Key Steps for a Successful Migration

### 1. Strategic Assessment

- Evaluate the current AWS ALB environment, documenting critical features such as:
  - Path-based routing
  - Health checks
  - SSL/TLS termination
  - Autoscaling
  - Security integrations
- Map these capabilities to Azure Application Gateway features, including:
  - Zone redundancy
  - Built-in Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - Certificate management via Azure Key Vault

### 2. Preparation

- Document configurations and export or convert SSL/TLS certificates from AWS
- Update backend services to leverage Azure routing and monitoring
- Reduce DNS TTL values to support a rapid and low-downtime cutover
- Utilize Infrastructure as Code for reliable resource deployment and repeatability

### 3. Migration Execution

- Deploy Azure Application Gateway and backend resources in parallel with the AWS environment
- Validate routing, security settings, health probe configurations
- Monitor DNS propagation and service health during the cutover
- Use Azure diagnostics and monitoring tools for visibility and early issue detection

### 4. Validation & Optimization

- Compare Azure Application Gateway metrics to AWS baselines
- Validate the accuracy of routing and test failover scenarios
- Employ Azure Monitor and Log Analytics to gather insights and optimize performance
- Adopt an iterative approach to refine configurations and meet evolving requirements

## Best Practices for Enterprise Migration

- **Leverage Azure Ecosystem:**
  - Use [Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/) for managing certificates
  - Implement WAF for application protection
  - Employ Azure Monitor for deep observability
- **Automate and Standardize:**
  - Use Infrastructure as Code tools to minimize errors and speed deployments
- **Testing:**
  - Conduct automated and manual tests to verify all capabilities post-migration
- **Downtime Minimization:**
  - Schedule cutovers during low-traffic periods and develop rollback plans
- **Continuous Monitoring:**
  - Utilize analytics and alerting for ongoing optimization

## Conclusion

Migrating to Azure Application Gateway modernizes your application delivery and security posture while providing opportunities for continued innovation. Refer to the [Azure Application Gateway best practices documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-application-gateway) for more insights.
