OnionDeluxe shares insights on the perceived decline of C#’s relevance in today’s job market, exploring the shift in language and tool preferences in engineering roles.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

OnionDeluxe reflects on current trends in engineering management job postings, noticing a marked absence of demand for C# and .NET experience. Instead, languages and platforms such as Node.js, AWS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, and Kotlin are now in the spotlight. OnionDeluxe expresses concerns that this shift could render decades of C#/.NET expertise less relevant, particularly within the EU job market.

## Key Observations

- **Job Listings:** Most engineering management posts no longer mention C# or .NET, focusing instead on other languages and platforms.
- **Tooling Trends:** There’s a surge in the preference for VS Code over traditional Visual Studio across learning materials and developer communities.
- **Language Bias:** The rise of AI has bolstered Python’s popularity—often perceived as the default for experimentation and proof-of-concept projects, though questioned for enterprise development suitability.
- **Personal Reflection:** With over 20 years invested in C#/.NET, the author voices uncertainty regarding the ongoing value of this expertise.
- **Geographical Note:** The analysis is based on the EU job market; the author acknowledges other regions may differ.

## Broader Implications

OnionDeluxe’s post raises questions about:

- The evolving landscape of programming language popularity, potentially shifting the market value of traditional Microsoft stack skills.
- How tool and language trends influence career trajectories for seasoned developers.
- The ongoing relevance of C#/.NET in enterprise environments, especially outside of regions where such technologies are dominant.

## Discussion Points

- The community may want to discuss whether these trends are temporary, cyclical, or signal a fundamental industry shift.
- Consideration of strategies for experienced C# developers to adapt or diversify their skill sets.
