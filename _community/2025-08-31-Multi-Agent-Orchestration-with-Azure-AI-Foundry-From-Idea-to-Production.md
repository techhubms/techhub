# Multi-Agent Orchestration with Azure AI Foundry: From Idea to Production

Enterprise workflows today are increasingly complex, involving multiple systems, real-time operations, and strict compliance requirements. Traditional, monolithic AI solutions are not flexible enough—multi-agent approaches offer more scalability and reliability.

## Why Multi-Agent, and Why Now?

Business processes span data retrieval, policy validation, approvals, and often require human sign-off. Azure AI Foundry introduces:

- **Agent Service**: Design goal-directed agents, add enterprise tool integrations, and apply policies.
- **Connected Agents (A2A)**: Agents as modular “tools” delegated by an orchestrator for specialized tasks—communication and routing becomes simple.
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Adds state for context persistence, managed retries, compensation, and long-running steps—ideal for multi-stage approvals and exception handling.
- **Interoperability**: Use MCP for context sharing and A2A for agent-to-agent messaging—works across Azure and external clouds.
- **Observability & Trust**: In-built tracing, metrics, evaluation, and guardrails ensure quality, security, and transparency.

## Reference Architecture

A typical flow:

1. **User/System trigger** starts process.
2. **Orchestrator Agent** receives the goal, delegates subtasks to:
    - **Retrieval Agent** (e.g., with Azure AI Search, Fabric/OneLake)
    - **Analysis Agent** (performs calculations or code execution)
    - **Policy Agent** (handles entitlements, responsible AI, approvals)
    - **Action Agent** (updates systems using OpenAPI, Logic Apps, Functions)
3. Results are consolidated by Orchestrator, optionally reviewed by a human, then audited and logged using Foundry’s observability features.

## Real-World Scenarios

### 1. Customer Support Autopilot

- **Flow**: Orchestrator receives a support ticket, classifies it, Retrieval Agent fetches history, Analysis Agent drafts a fix, Policy Agent checks entitlements, Action Agent updates CRM and sends a response.
- **Benefit**: Dividing tasks among distinct agents makes the workflow more resilient and troubleshooting faster.

### 2. Financial Approvals

- **Flow**: Orchestrator parses invoices, Extraction Agent gathers data, Risk Agent screens for anomalies, Policy Agent ensures compliance and limits, actions gate through human approval, Action Agent posts results to ERP.
- **Benefit**: Stateful, auditable workflows fit approval chains and compliance requirements.

### 3. Supply Chain Exception Handling

- **Flow**: Orchestrator ingests events, Forecast Agent measures impact, Vendor Agent queries lead times, Plan Agent suggests mitigation, Policy Agent validates, Action Agent initiates changes.
- **Benefit**: Specialization reduces latency, orchestrator remains streamlined.

## Building Your First Connected-Agent Workflow

### 1. Create Project & Deploy Models

- Provision distinct models for orchestrator and specialist agents.
- Integrate data sources like Azure AI Search, Fabric/OneLake, SharePoint, and register system tools (OpenAPI, Logic Apps, Functions).

### 2. Define Agent Roles

- Orchestrator: Coordinates and compiles results
- Retrieval: Provides enterprise data grounding
- Analysis: Runs calculations and code
- Policy: Checks rules, entitlements
- Action: Executes side-effectful system updates

### 3. Register Connected Agents (A2A)

- In the portal, add each specialist as an orchestrator tool. In SDK/CLI, reference child agent IDs in orchestrator configuration.

**Conceptual Example (Pseudocode):**

```python
orchestrator = agents.create(
    name="orchestrator",
    instructions="You coordinate specialists. Delegate, verify, and compile final answers."
)
retrieval = agents.create(name="retrieval", tools=["azure_ai_search:kb_index"])
analysis  = agents.create(name="analysis",  tools=["code_interpreter"])
policy    = agents.create(name="policy",    tools=["policy_rules:mcp"])
action    = agents.create(name="action",    tools=["openapi:erp","logicapp:notify"])

# Connect specialists as 'tools' on the orchestrator (A2A)

agents.connect(parent=orchestrator.id, children=[retrieval.id, analysis.id, policy.id, action.id])
```

### 4. Orchestrate the Workflow

- Set stateful steps, retry/backoff policies, and routes for human-in-the-loop approvals where required. Example workflow pseudocode:

```yaml
steps:
  - delegate: retrieval
    retry: {max: 2, backoff: expo}
  - parallel:
      - analysis
      - policy
  - gate:
      type: human_approval
      condition: "${policy.limit_exceeded == true}"
  - delegate: action
audit:
  trace: enabled
  pii_redaction: strict
```

### 5. Monitor, Evaluate, and Improve

- Use tracing, metrics, and evaluation features
- Compare prompts, tools, and model mixes
- Assign strict cost/latency budgets and use content safety measures

## Design Advice

- Start with two agents—expand only if needed
- Make responsibilities clear and isolated
- Steps should be idempotent; leverage correlation IDs for tracking
- Use human-approval gates for irreversible or sensitive actions
- Monitor cost and latency closely
- Route exceptions and approvals to humans, ensuring traceability
