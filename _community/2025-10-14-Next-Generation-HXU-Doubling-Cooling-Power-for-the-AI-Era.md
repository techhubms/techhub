# Next Generation HXU: Doubling Cooling Power for the AI Era

AI workloads are pushing datacenter limits, requiring not just more compute, but dramatically enhanced cooling. Microsoft’s next generation Heat Exchanger Unit (HXU) is engineered for the challenges of today’s hyperscale AI deployments.

## Key Features

- **Twice the cooling capacity** of the previous HXU, supporting rack densities greater than 240 kW without increasing the physical footprint.
- **Seamless integration** into existing air-cooled aisles, with a matching two-tile width for easy upgrades.
- **Reliability & Resilience**: Redundant pumps, fans, and power feeds for >99.9% uptime, minimizing disruptions for mission-critical AI.
- **Modular architecture**: Swappable pumps, fans, filters; fast couplings; segmented manifolds for flexible and serviceable installations.

## Cooling Innovations for AI

AI accelerators now often drive rack power densities well over 200 kW, beyond traditional air-cooling’s reach. Fully retrofitting legacy datacenters for liquid cooling is expensive and time-consuming. The next-gen HXU enables liquid-cooling capabilities for high-density AI systems—without major overhauls.

## Reliability & Cybersecurity

- **Redundancy:** Multi-pump and dual-power designs maximize availability.
- **Security:** Secure boot, NIST SP 800-53, CIS controls, and ISO/IEC 27001 compliance ensure firmware integrity and datacenter compliance.
- **Telemetry:** Built-in predictive analytics allow operations teams to anticipate maintenance needs, reducing downtime.

## System Design Highlights

- Modular design for core mechanicals
- Quick-disconnects and segmented manifolds for flexible deployment
- Leak detection, drip pans, and environmental monitoring to manage risk

## Sustainable, Scalable AI Infrastructure

By doubling cooling capabilities while improving resilience, the next-gen HXU enables the next wave of AI innovation. Operators can deploy cutting-edge AI accelerators without sacrificing efficiency or uptime, helping future-proof Azure and other Microsoft-hosted AI workloads.

## Learn & Collaborate

Microsoft invites the community to explore its open-source hardware cooling contributions with the Open Compute Project Foundation, sharing knowledge and shaping the future of AI datacenter design.
