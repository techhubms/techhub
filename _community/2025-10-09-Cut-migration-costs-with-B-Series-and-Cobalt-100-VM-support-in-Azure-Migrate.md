# Cut Migration Costs with B-Series and Cobalt 100 VM Support in Azure Migrate

## Introduction

Migrating to the cloud doesn't have to mean higher costs. Many workloads—such as development/test environments, small databases, and low-traffic applications—don't need continuous CPU power. Azure Migrate now supports both B-Series and Cobalt 100 VMs, providing more flexibility and cost optimization during migration planning.

## B-Series VMs: Burstable Power, Lower Costs

B-Series virtual machines allow workloads with variable CPU usage to operate cost-effectively:

- **Baseline Performance:** Pay for a steady, low baseline of CPU performance.
- **Burst Capability:** Temporarily scale up with accumulated CPU credits.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Ideal for workloads that spend much of their time idle, such as dev/test, small web servers, or batch jobs.

**Savings example:**

- Standard_B8s v2 (B-Series): 8 vCPUs, 32 GiB RAM, approx $270.10/month (Windows license included)
- D8s v4 (D-Series): 8 vCPUs, 32 GiB RAM, approx $548.96/month (Windows license included)

If your workloads spike only occasionally, B-Series VMs can cut costs by up to 50% compared to D-Series.

## Cobalt 100 VMs: ARM-Native Power

Cobalt 100 VMs are optimized for ARM64 workloads:

- **Architecture Alignment:** Supports ARM64-based servers without major re-architecture.
- **Performance Gains:** Take advantage of ARM-native optimizations for better efficiency.
- **Cost Advantages:** Pair ARM64 hardware efficiency with Azure’s pricing for more value per core.

Great for migrating modern, energy-efficient workloads running on-premises ARM servers.

## Why Use New VM Types in Azure Migrate?

- Match workload needs to infrastructure for best performance and value
- Assess and plan migrations with improved accuracy
- Fit workloads onto the most suitable cloud resources available

## Get Started
