# Resolving Orphaned Azure Subscription Access When No Owner Is Reachable

## Summary

A client is unable to access an Azure subscription after the original Owner became unreachable. All other users, including the client (Reader role) and the author (Guest), lack the necessary permissions to recover ownership or to submit a support request through the Azure portal. The client is the paying customer and the legal owner but is unable to elevate privileges or request help via standard Azure support pathways.

## Problem

- No users with Owner privileges remain on the Azure subscription
- The client, with only Reader access, cannot submit a support request
- All support or escalation routes suggested by Microsoft require permissions the client does not possess

## What Was Attempted

- Multiple calls to Azure support, but calls were disconnected after long holds
- All Azure portal support request paths, blocked by insufficient permissions
- Contact forms on [azure.microsoft.com](http://azure.microsoft.com)
- Thoroughly reviewing all Microsoft documentation regarding orphaned subscriptions and role assignment
- Confirmation that the client is the legal intellectual property owner and bill-payer

## Request

The author seeks advice for any process or escalation pathway, outside the Azure portal, that could enable transfer or recovery of the orphaned Azure subscription. The author notes readiness to provide proof of IP and business ownership if escalation succeeds.

## Community Suggestions and Solutions

- **Elevate Access for Entra Global Admin**: Use the documented process ([see Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin?$WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003556)) to temporarily grant a Global Admin the ability to manage all subscriptions and management groups. This can help regain access if there is a Global Admin in the tenant.
    - Check the Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) tenant's properties for the feature flag indicating which account (potentially a Global Admin) can manage all resources.
- **Provide Documentation to Azure Support**: If able to reach a human via alternate Microsoft channels, prepare:
    - Proof of business and/or IP ownership
    - Ownership contracts
    - Payment records
- **Contact Microsoft Through Other Subscriptions or Channels**:
    - Submit a ticket referencing another active subscription, but explain in the issue that help is needed with the orphaned subscription
    - Use a Microsoft Gold Partner ([Find a Partner](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/partnership/find-a-partner)) for assistance
    - Contact Microsoft MVPs via [MVP search](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/search?target=Profile&program=MVP) or LinkedInâ€”they may have direct escalation contacts
- **Payment-Based Escalation**: The individual or company paying the Azure bill should have a contact path with Microsoft for billing that may provide a route for escalation, even without subscription Owner role

If you find yourself in a similar position, ensure proof of payment, IP ownership, and business documentation are easily accessible for any interactions with Microsoft or its partners.
