TulikaC introduces support for Python 3.14 on Azure App Service for Linux, explaining performance improvements and offering migration steps for developers to upgrade and test their web applications.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Python 3.14 Now Available on Azure App Service for Linux

**Author:** TulikaC  
**Published:** October 30, 2025

Azure App Service for Linux now supports Python 3.14 as a first-class runtime environment. This enables developers to build and deploy web applications and APIs using the latest advancements in the Python ecosystem while leveraging Azure’s managed platform benefits.

## Key Improvements in Python 3.14

- **Performance Under Load:** Internal interpreter optimizations reduce common call overhead and minimize memory usage, resulting in lower latency and less CPU consumption for typical web apps and APIs.
- **Concurrency:** Python 3.14 continues its move towards a free-threaded build (eliminating the global interpreter lock/GIL), empowering developers to utilize multiple CPU cores more efficiently. Additionally, subinterpreters and improvements in multi-threaded execution offer better scalability for CPU-bound or high-throughput workloads.
- **Developer Productivity:** Enhanced interactive REPL with better syntax highlighting and error hints, cleaner typing using deferred annotations, and introduction of template string syntax ("t-strings") for safer, structured string interpolation.

For a detailed breakdown of new language features, see the [Python 3.14 release notes](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.14.html).

## How to Get Started

If you're running an earlier version of Python on Azure App Service for Linux, now is a good time to validate your application on 3.14:

1. **Deploy to a Staging Environment**: Create a new deployment slot or staging app configured with Python 3.14.
2. **Test Thoroughly:** Run your workflows and monitor request latency, CPU, and memory usage to gauge the impact of the new runtime.
3. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure that any native wheels or pinned dependencies are compatible and install without errors.

In most cases, updates needed for Python 3.14 will be minor, allowing you to benefit from increased performance and a more robust platform while Azure continues to manage OS, runtime patches, and security updates for you.

## Automated Deployment Options

- **Azure Portal:** Create and configure applications with Python 3.14 through the portal’s interface.
- **Azure CLI:** Use scripts to automate deployment or updates.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Apply ARM or Bicep templates for repeatable deployment.

## Summary

With this release, developers get immediate access to the latest Python innovations while relying on Azure’s fully-managed infrastructure and security model.
