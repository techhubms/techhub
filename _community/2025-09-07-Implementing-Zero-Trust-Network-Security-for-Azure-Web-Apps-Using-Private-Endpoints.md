# Implementing Zero-Trust Network Security for Azure Web Apps Using Private Endpoints

**Lab Objective:**
Demonstrate how to completely remove public internet access from an Azure App Service Web App and secure it within a private virtual network using Private Endpoints, following a zero-trust model.

## Introduction

The principle of "never trust, always verify" is fundamental to modern security. Although Azure Web Apps are public by default, enterprise workloads often demand network isolation for compliance and to reduce risk. Using Private Endpoints, you can restrict access so the web app is only reachable via your private network infrastructure.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Establish a Foundational Resource Group and Virtual Network

- **Resource Group**: Create a new resource group to logically organize your resources.
- **Virtual Network (VNet)**: Set up a VNet that will host your private endpoints and provide secure communication between your resources.

### 2. Deploy a Basic Web Application

- Use Azure Portal or CLI to create a new Azure App Service (Web App).
- Ensure the app runs within the resource group created above.

### 3. Implement Core Security Controls with Private Endpoint and Private DNS

- **Private Endpoint**: Create a Private Endpoint for the Web App, linking it to your VNet. This creates a private IP for the app within your internal network.
- **Private DNS Integration**: Configure Private DNS Zone to ensure internal name resolution for the web app via the private endpoint (e.g., `webappname.privatelink.azurewebsites.net`).

### 4. Enforce Network Isolation with Access Restrictions

- Set up access restrictions to prohibit all public internet access.
- Allow only traffic from select subnets within your VNet (whitelisting specific sources is optional but recommended).
- Remove/default-deny all other sources to enforce zero public accessibility.

### 5. Validate the Security Configuration

- Access the web app from a VM or resource within your private VNet to confirm connectivity.
- Confirm that the web app is inaccessible from the public internet.
- Use tools like `curl`, browser tests, or network diagnostic tools to verify isolation.

## Conclusion

Securing Azure Web Apps with Private Endpoints and access restrictions is a practical implementation of Zero Trust security. Following this process ensures only trusted, internal clients can reach your applications, helping meet compliance and enterprise security standards.
