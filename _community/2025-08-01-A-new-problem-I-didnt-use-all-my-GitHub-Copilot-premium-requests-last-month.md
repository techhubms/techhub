# GitHub Copilot Premium Requests: Managing Monthly Usage

*By thehashimwarren*

## Introduction

Many developers leveraging AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot now have access to premium requests—higher performance calls using advanced models like Claude 4. Each month, users are granted a fresh allowance of these requests, resetting regularly with no option to carry over unused quota.

## The Challenge: Surplus Requests

The author describes a common dilemma: while initially worried about running out of premium requests, they ended the month with a surplus. Unfortunately, GitHub Copilot does not allow these unused premium requests to carry over to the next month, making any leftover allocation effectively lost.

## Last-Minute Usage

Realizing their overabundance of credits as the month closed, the author quickly attempted to use up the remaining requests on a project. However, by the time they checked their usage, the quota had already reset, and they were operating on the new month's allowance.

## Adjusting the Strategy

Learning from the previous month's experience, the author has decided on a new approach: instead of rationing premium requests, they plan to use them freely until depleted. Afterward, they’ll switch to alternative models or systems, such as the Gemini CLI, to continue their workflow efficiently.

## Planning Ahead

This usage pattern highlights the importance of understanding subscription policies and maximizing value from premium services. For developers using tools like GitHub Copilot, being strategic with request usage ensures optimal productivity while avoiding missed opportunities.

## Conclusion

Monthly resets of premium requests require thoughtful allocation strategies. By adapting usage habits and being flexible with models or systems, developers can make the most of their tools while staying productive throughout the billing cycle.
