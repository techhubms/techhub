## Inclusive Communication with Sign Language Mode in Microsoft Teams

**Author:** KerryPerezHeffernan

Microsoft Teams continues its commitment to inclusive and empowering communications by unveiling the new Sign Language Mode. This feature is specifically designed to bridge communication and collaboration gaps for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing (D/HH) community, ensuring that all participants have equitable access and a seamless meeting experience.

### What Is Sign Language Mode?

Sign Language Mode is a new Teams feature developed alongside Microsoft's internal D/HH community. The feature aims to make meetings more accessible by considering the requirements of signers and their interpreters. It incorporates several enhancements:

#### Key Features

- **Self-Identification:**
  - D/HH signers and interpreters can self-identify their roles within a meeting, enabling Teams to adapt and optimize the meeting experience for sign language interactions.

- **Improved Video Quality:**
  - Video clarity is automatically improved for signers, ensuring hand movements and gestures are clear and easily followed throughout the meeting.

- **Interpreter Visibility:**
  - Sign language interpreters are made easier to find and remain visible both on the meeting stage and within the participant roster, keeping D/HH participants visually connected to their support.

- **Automatic Sign Language Detection:**
  - Built on a new sign language detection model, Teams now recognizes when someone is actively signing. When detected, that participant is automatically elevated to active speaker status, including a highlighted border around their video tile. This ensures that signers maintain their presence and visibility, mirroring the recognition given to audio speakers.

### How to Use Sign Language Mode

For detailed, step-by-step instructions on enabling and utilizing Sign Language Mode, users are encouraged to visit the official support article: [Use Sign Language Mode in Microsoft Teams Meetings](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-sign-language-mode-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-8f88ed08-5a5e-41db-a190-e0b30cab58ca).

### Behind the Scenes: The Sign Language Detection Feature

Development of Sign Language Mode exemplifies Microsoft's approach to inclusive design, led by input from Deaf leadership and cross-disciplinary teams. More insights into this process are available on the Microsoft Design blog: [Centering Sign Language in AI and Design: A Deaf-led Approach](https://microsoft.design/articles/centering-sign-language-in-ai-and-design/).

### Looking Forward

Microsoft intends to continue evolving Sign Language Mode, with ongoing improvements planned for the visibility, participation, and representation of D/HH signers and interpreters in Teams meetings.

If you have a disability or need assistance with accessibility features in any Microsoft product, the Microsoft Disability Answer Desk offers support in multiple languages and American Sign Language (ASL) via direct video.
