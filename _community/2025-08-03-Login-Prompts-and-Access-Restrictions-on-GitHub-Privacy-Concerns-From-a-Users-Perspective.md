## Login Prompts and Access Barriers on GitHub: User Experience and Privacy Concerns

### Author: Mabymaster

#### Background

Mabymaster details an ongoing challenge when attempting to browse public GitHub repositories via mobile devices. Initially expecting GitHub—a platform traditionally known for its open access to public code repositories—to remain accessible without requiring user authentication, the author now frequently encounters mandatory login prompts.

#### Experiencing Access Issues

According to the author, each attempt to search for usernames or repositories on GitHub.com via a mobile browser immediately results in a prompt to log in. This occurs even when using different browsers, clearing cookies, connecting through a VPN, or utilizing privacy-focused tools like Tor. Efforts to circumvent these login requests have led instead to 'too many requests' errors, further restricting site access.

#### Privacy Concerns

Mabymaster expresses uneasiness over what appears to be an attempt by GitHub to track device or browser fingerprints, raising broader questions about privacy and the motivations for collecting user data even during casual browsing. While the author acknowledges the existence of an account as a workaround, there is skepticism about why anonymous access to public content has become more difficult. The inference is that GitHub’s actions may be related to limiting privacy or encouraging data collection.

#### Open Questions to the Community

The post concludes with the author seeking input from others about similar experiences and asks if alternate means exist to regain previous levels of access. There is a clear reluctance to engage in login-required behaviors, stemming from concern over data harvesting.
