# Developer Tier APIM + Self-hosted Gateway: Architecture and Considerations

Azure API Management (APIM) offers multiple service tiers tailored to different use cases. The Developer tier, while typically intended for non-production scenarios, includes access to many features usually reserved for premium plans—such as Virtual Network (VNet) injection, Microsoft Entra integration, private endpoint support, and a self-hosted gateway option.

## Feature Comparison of APIM Tiers

Here is an overview of selected features across APIM tiers:

| Feature                                    | Consumption | Developer | Basic | Basic v2 | Standard | Standard v2 | Premium | Premium v2 (preview) |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| Microsoft Entra integration                | No          | Yes       | No    | Yes      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes     | Yes                  |
| VNet injection support                     | No          | Yes       | No    | No       | No       | No          | Yes     | Yes                  |
| Private endpoint support                   | No          | Yes       | Yes   | No       | Yes      | Yes         | Yes     | No                   |
| Self-hosted gateway                        | No          | Yes       | No    | No       | No       | No          | Yes     | No                   |
| API analytics                              | No          | Yes       | Yes   | Yes      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes     | Yes                  |
| Built-in cache                             | No          | Yes       | Yes   | Yes      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes     | Yes                  |
| Management over Git                        | No          | Yes       | Yes   | No       | Yes      | No          | Yes     | No                   |
| Azure Monitor & Log Analytics request logs | No          | Yes       | Yes   | Yes      | Yes      | Yes         | Yes     | Yes                  |
| And more...                               |             |           |       |          |          |             |         |                      |

## Limitations of Developer Tier

- **No SLA Guarantee:** The Developer tier is designed for non-production/evaluation
- **Service Interruptions:** It may be disrupted by maintenance events (such as OS upgrades)
- **Intended for Testing:** Not recommended for mission-critical workloads

## Combining with Self-hosted Gateway

To increase control over API gateway availability while leveraging the Developer tier's rich features, you can deploy a self-hosted gateway on your own Azure VM or infrastructure. This approach allows:

- **Direct management of underlying infrastructure** (e.g., schedule your own VM updates)
- **Greater flexibility over maintenance schedules**—helpful in avoiding outages during business hours
- **Continued access to Developer tier "premium" features**

### Example Use Case

- **Set up APIM Developer tier in Azure**
- **Provision an Azure VM**
- **Install and configure the self-hosted APIM gateway on the VM**
- **Manage VM updates according to business needs**

This hybrid setup gives teams improved infrastructure control compared to using Developer tier APIM alone, at a lower cost than Premium, although still without a formal SLA.

## Conclusion

Combining Azure API Management Developer tier with a self-hosted gateway can provide more flexibility and control for non-production or cost-sensitive environments, especially when direct infrastructure management is needed. Be mindful, however, that this architecture is not covered by Microsoft's production SLA, and is best suited for dev/test workloads or evaluation scenarios.
