Effective_Being_8048 asks for practical advice on architecting a deployment pipeline that manages multiple environments, server roles, and application dependencies without hardcoding configurations. This summary explores their setup, challenges, and desired solutions.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Article Summary

Effective_Being_8048 is designing a deployment pipeline spanning four environments: Production, PreProduction, Test, and Development. Each of these environments contains a differing number of virtual machines (VMs), with deployments involving tasks like file copy operations and service management (i.e., no containers or cloud-native orchestration yet).

### Key Challenges Presented

- **Server/Role/App Mapping**: Each application must be deployed to specific servers aligned with their roles (frontend, backend, job processor, etc.).
- **Variable Groups Limitation**: The initial attempt to use Azure DevOps Variable Groups for mapping servers to applications encountered significant shortcomings, especially for expressing server roles and inter-application dependencies.
- **Application Dependencies**: The author needs to support deployments where certain applications must be deployed in a specific order (e.g., App B depends on App A).
- **Dynamic Targeting**: There's a desire for a system to target VMs dynamically based on environment and role, avoiding hardcoded mappings or scattered variable group definitions.
- **Tag Management Complexity**: While VM tags could provide a way to indicate roles, dynamic resolution and maintenance appear complex within their current workflow.

### What the Author Wants

- A clean, maintainable way to:
  - Target servers dynamically by role and environment
  - Maintain an up-to-date inventory of which apps go where
  - Encode/apply application dependency chains in deployment logic
- To avoid hardcoded, repetitive configurations

### Community Request

The author is soliciting:

- Tooling suggestions
- Process and pattern recommendations
- Conceptual models for expressing the required mappings and dependencies
- Real-world experiences or case studies from similar projects

### Discussion Points for Response

- Inventory management and dynamic role assignment patterns in Azure DevOps and other common toolchains
- Managing dependencies and order of deployment in pipelines using YAML, task dependencies, or custom scripts
- Possibility of external configuration (e.g., JSON, YAML, or database-driven inventories) as a mapping layer between servers, roles, and applications
- Integrations with CMDBs or lightweight service registries
- Use of orchestration tools (Ansible, PowerShell DSC, etc.) for more granular application of deployment logic

The article provides a concise yet thorough overview of the difficulties encountered when scaling beyond basic Variable Group usage in Azure DevOps. Suggestions or case studies about centralizing deployment logic, configuration-driven pipelines, or better inventory solutions would directly address the authorâ€™s concerns.
