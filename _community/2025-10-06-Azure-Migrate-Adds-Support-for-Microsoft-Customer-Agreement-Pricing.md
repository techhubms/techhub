# Azure Migrate Adds Support for Microsoft Customer Agreement Pricing

Azure Migrate now allows organizations to incorporate their negotiated Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) pricing into migration assessments. This enhancement provides more accurate projections for cloud migration costs and empowers decision-makers to plan migrations with greater confidence.

## What is the Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)?

The Microsoft Customer Agreement is a modern, digital contract that simplifies how companies buy and manage Microsoft services. Key features include:

- **Simplified Terms:** A single agreement covering all Microsoft services.
- **Flexible Purchasing:** Choose pay-as-you-go or commit to specific services.
- **Negotiated Discounts:** MCA offers up to 60% discounts off retail pricing based on individual contracts.
- **Centralized Billing:** Consolidated invoices and standardized cost tracking across subscriptions.

MCA aims to deliver predictability and transparency, addressing concerns around unclear or fluctuating cloud costs.

## Why Does MCA Integration in Azure Migrate Matter?

Previously, migration assessments used retail rates, often leading to uncertainty for organizations with specialized contracts. With MCA integration, users can:

- View assessments reflecting their actual, negotiated rates
- Gain true visibility into migration costs
- Plan migrations more accurately and confidently by prioritizing workloads based on realistic scenarios

## How to Use MCA Pricing in Azure Migrate

To incorporate MCA:

1. In Azure Migrate, start by selecting "Create Assessment."
2. Add relevant workloads to the scope.
3. Under **General Settings**, choose 'Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)' as the Offer/License program.
4. Select the correct Subscription ID reflecting your contract.
5. View and compare projected costs using both retail and your MCA rates to assess savings and optimize planning.

## Key Benefits

- **Accuracy:** Assessments now use realistic MCA-based pricing.
- **Flexibility:** Simulate multiple migration scenarios with confidence.
- **Speed:** Faster, more informed migration planning.
