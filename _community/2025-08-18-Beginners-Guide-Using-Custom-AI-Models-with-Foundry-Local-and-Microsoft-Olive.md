# Beginner’s Guide: Using Custom AI Models with Foundry Local and Microsoft Olive

**Author:** kinfey

## Overview

This guide shows you how to run your own small AI language models on your Windows or Mac computer using Foundry Local. It covers converting models (like Qwen3-0.6B) for local use with Microsoft Olive, along with detailed steps for setup, conversion, and troubleshooting.

## What is Foundry Local?

Foundry Local lets you run AI models locally, providing privacy and performance benefits. It works with model families such as:

- **Phi models** (by Microsoft)
- **Qwen models** (by Alibaba)
- **DeepSeek models**

## Why Model Conversion?

Models are usually distributed in **PyTorch** format for training/portability but should be converted for efficient local inference. Two main formats:

- **GGUF:** Simple, memory-efficient, CPU-only, best for basic or older setups
- **ONNX:** Professional, hardware-accelerated, supports GPU/NPU, industry standard

For beginners, ONNX is recommended for better performance and future flexibility.

## Microsoft Olive: Your Model Conversion Helper

Microsoft Olive is a tool that automates conversion and compression (supports formats like INT4, INT8, FP16). It works on all major hardware and streamlines the conversion process.

### Key Benefits

- Handles conversion options and hardware compatibility for you
- Automates complex command-line steps
- Works with Hugging Face model zoo and other sources

## Step-by-Step Conversion Guide

### 1. Install Required Tools

Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install transformers -U
pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/Olive.git
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-genai
cd onnxruntime-genai && python build.py --config Release
pip install {Your build release path}/onnxruntime_genai-0.9.0.dev0-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl
```

- Ensure **CMake >= 3.31** is installed ([cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/))

### 2. Convert the Model the Easy Way

```
olive auto-opt \
  --model_name_or_path {Your Qwen3-0.6B Path} \
  --device cpu \
  --provider CPUExecutionProvider \
  --use_model_builder \
  --precision int4 \
  --output_path models/Qwen3-0.6B/onnx \
  --log_level 1
```

- `--precision int4` reduces size for efficiency
- Swap `cpu` for `cuda` if you want GPU acceleration

### 3. Advanced Configuration (Optional)

Create `conversion_config.json`:

```json
{
  "input_model": {
    "type": "HfModel",
    "model_path": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "task": "text-generation"
  },
  "systems": {
    "local_system": {
      "type": "LocalSystem",
      "accelerators": [
        { "execution_providers": ["CPUExecutionProvider"] }
      ]
    }
  },
  "passes": {
    "builder": { "type": "ModelBuilder", "config": { "precision": "int4" } }
  },
  "host": "local_system",
  "target": "local_system",
  "cache_dir": "cache",
  "output_dir": "model/output/Qwen3-0.6B-ONNX"
}
```

Run:

```
olive run --config ./conversion_config.json
```

You'll need to log in to Hugging Face for downloading models:

```
huggingface-cli login
```

## Setting Up the Converted Model in Foundry Local

1. Install Foundry Local and convert your model as above
2. Navigate to your models folder:
   - `foundry cache cd ./models/`
3. Create a chat template `inference_model.json`:

```json
{
  "Name": "Qwen3-0.6b-cpu",
  "PromptTemplate": {
    "system": "<|im_start|>system\n{Content}<|im_end|>",
    "user": "<|im_start|>user\n/think{Content}<|im_end|>",
    "assistant": "<|im_start|>assistant\n{Content}<|im_end|>",
    "prompt": "<|im_start|>user\n/think{Content}<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant"
  }
}
```

1. Organize your files:
   - `mkdir -p ./models/qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`
   - Place ONNX files and `inference_model.json` here
2. Verify with `foundry cache ls`
3. Launch your model:
   - `foundry model run Qwen3-0.6b-cpu`

## Troubleshooting

- **Model not found:** Ensure files are placed in the correct directory
- **Weird responses:** Double-check chat template formatting
- **Slow performance:** Close unused programs, try a smaller model or enable GPU use
- **Command failures:** Confirm Python ≥ 3.8 and internet connectivity

## Summary

You now know how to:

- Convert AI models from PyTorch to ONNX
- Use Microsoft Olive for conversion
- Set up models in Foundry Local
- Troubleshoot common installation and runtime issues
