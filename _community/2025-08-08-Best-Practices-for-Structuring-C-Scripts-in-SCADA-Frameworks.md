# Best Practices for Structuring C# Scripts in SCADA Frameworks

*Author: DouglasRoldan*

## Overview

This community-sourced discussion focuses on organizing and optimizing C# scripts in SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) environments, where each graphic form or screen may execute its own dedicated script. The primary goals discussed include improving maintainability, supporting code reuse, and ensuring good performance.

## Key Community Questions

- How should code be structured when scripting directly within a SCADA framework?
- Is it possible (and recommended) to separate common logic into shared classes or DLLs?
- What pitfalls and performance issues should be avoided in this kind of scripting environment?
- Are there resources or examples to learn sustainable C# scripting patterns for such frameworks?

## Community Recommendations

### 1. Code Organization and Best Practices

- **Apply SOLID and DRY Principles**: Try to keep your code modular (Single Responsibility) and avoid repetition (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
- **Minimize Direct Form Logic**: Move reusable logic out of individual form scripts when possible, using shared libraries or utility classes if the framework supports it.

### 2. Leveraging Shared Libraries

- **Use DLLs for Shared Functions**: If your SCADA system allows DLL integration, bundle common code into assemblies to improve maintainability and reduce duplication.
  - _Tip_: Test DLL loading/performance overhead within your framework first as some SCADA products restrict this or have specific requirements.
- **Shared Classes and Methods**: Even within scripts, structure code using static classes or helper methods for common operations. This keeps scripts concise and easier to update.

### 3. Performance and Complexity

- **Beware of Hidden Complexity**: Each form's script often runs on its own event loop or scheduler, so excessive calculations or O(n*m) loops can drag performance down, especially in large projects.
- **Focus on Efficient Algorithms**: Keep per-event computations minimal; batch work when possible, and avoid repeated computation across forms when global state can be shared or cached.

### 4. Community-Suggested Resources

- **Study General C# Coding Guidelines**: Resources about code design, refactoring, and enterprise C# are often applicable.
- **Look at Related Projects**: Some recommend researching how other domains (like game scripting in Space Engineers) handle C# scripting in event-driven or embedded environments.
- **Ask Vendor or Product Communities**: If using a specific SCADA platform (e.g., ft optix), check their documentation and community forums for scripting best practices.

## Example Tip

> "The framework already gives each object an opportunity to perform calculations regularly, so avoid any logic that grows in complexity with the number of graphics or objects. Centralize calculations when possible and avoid repeated non-constant operations."

## Additional Notes

- If you’re new to these environments, start small—refactor one or two forms into using shared code, monitor for regressions, and expand from there.
- Refer to C# design pattern resources and examples for inspiration on modularity and common scripting pitfalls.

## Conclusion

Organizing C# scripts in SCADA frameworks benefits from modularity, clear separation between visual layer and logic, and efficient use of shared code. Prioritize maintainability, keep performance in mind, and don’t hesitate to consult both C# and SCADA-specific resources for community wisdom and evolving best practices.
