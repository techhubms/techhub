# Lower Costs and Boost Flexibility with Azure Files Provisioned v2 for SSD

**Author:** wmgries

Azure has announced the general availability of the provisioned v2 model for Azure Files on the SSD (premium) media tier. This enhancement targets both enterprise IT professionals and cloud-native developers looking for flexible, cost-efficient file storage.

## What Is Provisioned v2?

- **Provisioned v2 decouples performance from capacity**, letting you scale IOPS and throughput independently from storage size.
- Minimum share size lowered to **32 GiB** (from 100 GiB). Maximum share size raised to **256 TiB**.
- **No downtime required** for scaling up or down â€“ adjust your file share's capacity or performance as workloads change.

## Why Upgrade to Provisioned v2?

- **Affordability:** Entry costs as low as $3.20/month.
- **Flexibility:** Scale up or down performance with no downtime and align storage to actual needs.
- **Predictable Pricing:** Simple, easy-to-understand cost models with sample scenarios provided.
- **High Performance:** Suited for high-IOPS, low-latency workloads like SQL Server, Oracle, SAP, AKS, and media archives.
- **Scaled Sizing:** SSD shares now range from 32 GiB to 256 TiB.
- **Telemetry Support:** Real-time monitoring enables ongoing tuning of file share provisioning.

## Example Workloads and Savings

| Scenario | Provisioned v1 | Provisioned v2 | Savings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workload w/ default IOPS & throughput (10 TiB) | $1,638.40/mo | $1,341.09/mo | 18% |
| Relational DB workload (4 TiB, 20K IOPS) | $2,720/mo | $925.42/mo | 66% |
| Hot archive multimedia (100 TiB, 15K IOPS) | $16,384.00/mo | $10,641.93/mo | 35% |

## Right-Sized Performance

- **Database workloads** (SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB, SAP, EPIC) get needed high IOPS/throughput with less storage.
- **AKS & Containers:** Lower minimum share size and reduced cost per share promote efficient use for shared storage.
- **Media & Archives:** Fast retrieval and increased max share size help archive workloads that need both bursts and capacity.

## Getting Started

1. In Azure Portal, select "Azure Files" as service, "Premium" for performance, "Provisioned v2" for billing.
2. Available in all public Azure regions.
