# Azure AI Blogs Merge into Unified Azure AI Foundry Blog

## What’s Changed

Multiple Azure AI technical blogs—including the AI Platform Blog, Azure AI Services Blog, and Azure Machine Learning Blog—have been merged into a single location: the [Azure AI Foundry Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry). This consolidation provides a central hub for technical news, tutorials, and official announcements about Microsoft Azure AI.

---

## Seamless Access to Past Content

All existing content from the legacy blogs has been preserved and migrated into the Azure AI Foundry Blog archive. Old URLs and bookmarks are automatically redirected, so saved links will continue to work, leading you to the new site.

The former individual blogs now forward directly to the Azure AI Foundry Blog homepage for a seamless transition.

---

## Stay Connected: Update Your Subscription

Email and RSS subscriptions from the previous blogs did not carry over automatically. Followers and subscribers of the legacy AI Platform, Azure AI Services, and Machine Learning blogs need to **re-subscribe** to receive updates from the new Azure AI Foundry Blog.

- Subscribe using the “Follow” button on the [Azure AI Foundry Blog homepage](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure-ai-foundry).

This one-time re-subscription ensures you don’t miss the latest technical posts, product updates, and AI innovation news.

---

## Looking Ahead

The consolidation marks the beginning of a more unified and insightful experience, making it easier to discover how Microsoft’s Azure AI tools and services work together to build real-world solutions. The Azure AI team appreciates community support and anticipates continued engagement as new content and innovations are shared in this single hub.
