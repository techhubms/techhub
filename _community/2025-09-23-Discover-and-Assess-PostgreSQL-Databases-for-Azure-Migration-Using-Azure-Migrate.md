# Discover and Assess PostgreSQL Databases for Azure Migration Using Azure Migrate

Cloud migration can be challenging, especially with a variety of database technologies and workloads to modernize. **Azure Migrate** now offers unified, agentless discovery and assessment at scale for PostgreSQL databases, helping organizations migrate and optimize with confidence.

## Why Use Azure Migrate for PostgreSQL?

Azure Migrate now supports:

- **Agentless Discovery**: Use a lightweight appliance to discover on-premises PostgreSQL installations without agents on every host.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize application tiers and workload dependencies, including connections between your database and application servers.
- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Review configuration details (version, extensions, memory settings), support status, and readiness for specific Azure migration targets.
- **Migration Planning**: Get actionable guidance for modernizing to Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flexible Server, PaaS) or migrating as-is to Azure Virtual Machines (IaaS). Includes cost estimates, SKU recommendations, and compatibility checks.

## Supported Scenarios

- **Platforms**: Discover PostgreSQL servers running on Windows, Linux, VMware, Hyper-V, Bare-metal, and cloud services (such as AWS EC2 or Azure VM).
- **Database Versions**: Currently supports PostgreSQL Community Edition (versions 6-18).
- **Workload Tagging**: Group related resources for assessment, migration, and modernization.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Start Agentless Discovery**: Set up the Azure Migrate appliance to scan your environment for PostgreSQL databases.
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize which applications and workloads connect to each PostgreSQL instance, ensuring complete migration coverage.
3. **Assessment**: Review discovered inventory and verify readiness for Azure migration.
   - Review PostgreSQL version, installed extensions, configuration, and performance data (continuously updated).
   - Check compatibility with Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flexible Server) or Azure VMs.
   - Get Azure compute/storage SKU recommendations and cost assessment per target service and region.
4. **Address Migration Blockers**: Azure Migrate flags unsupported extensions and incompatible configurations.
5. **Migration Execution**: Use [Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/database-migration/) or [Azure Migrate: Migration and Modernization](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/migrate/server-migrate-overview?view=migrate) tools to move your PostgreSQL workloads.

## Key Benefits

- **Unified IT Estate View**: See Windows/Linux servers, ASP.NET/IIS, Java apps, SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL all in one place.
- **Cost Optimization**: Assess potential savings, select target SKUs, and compare service tiers.
- **Continuous Inventory Refresh**: Get up-to-date visibility as environments evolve.
