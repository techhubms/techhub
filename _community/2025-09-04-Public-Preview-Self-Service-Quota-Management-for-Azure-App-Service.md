jordanselig details the new self-service quota management experience for Azure App Service, helping developers and IT admins proactively manage resource limits via an updated portal interface.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Public Preview: Self-Service Quota Management for Azure App Service

**Author:** jordanselig  

The Azure team has announced a public preview of a redesigned self-service experience for managing App Service quotas. This update introduces a dedicated App Service Quota blade in the Azure portal, enabling developers and IT admins to gain better visibility and control over resource allocations.

## What's New?

- **Dedicated Quota Blade:** Access a new portal area to view current quota usage and limits for all App Service SKUs (VM sizes).
- **Customizable Quotas:** Set quotas suited to your application's needs without filing a support ticket in many cases.
- **Improved Resource Management:** Proactively manage application infrastructure, prevent service disruptions, and optimize performance.

## Quick Reference

1. **Large/Multi-Subscription Deployments:** For quota changes involving ten or more subscriptions, or any requiring zone redundancy, open a support ticket (Problem type: Quota).
2. **Other Cases:** Use the new self-service portal feature for immediate quota adjustments.

## How to Adjust App Service Quotas

### 1. Navigate to the Quotas Resource Provider

- Use the Azure portal and find the Quotas resource provider.

### 2. Select App Service

- Each VM size/SKU appears as a separate entry in this interface.
- You can filter by region, subscription, provider, or usage.
- Group data by usage, quota (SKU), or region.
- Track current usage in App Service VMs and spot SKUs nearing their quota limits.

### 3. Request Quota Adjustments

- Use the pen icon to specify a new quota value for the chosen SKU (not incremental; enter the desired final value).
- Submit your request for automatic processing.

#### Quota Approval Workflow

- If the portal can fulfill your request automatically, you'll be notified within minutes.
- If your request exceeds limits permitted for automatic approval, you'll be prompted to file a support request with the relevant details prefilled.

### 4. Support Tickets (If Needed)

- For zone-redundant needs or bulk quota requests across subscriptions, create a support ticket (Technical > Quota).
- Remember to specify the region and App Service plan. You can track requests via the [Help + support dashboard](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview).

## Known Issues (Public Preview Phase)

- Closing the quota request flyout window halts real-time notificationsâ€”leave it open until completion for status updates.
- Some SKUs may be missing from the dashboard initially (to be added over time).
- The Activity Log currently lacks detailed quota request histories (planned improvement).
- Zone-redundant deployments still require support ticket intervention; quota changes remain regional.
- Documentation in progress for supporting automated bulk requests via API.

## Feedback

The Azure team encourages users to provide feedback or report issues with the new quota management experience in the comments section.
