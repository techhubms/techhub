# Jekyll Implementation (Legacy Reference)

> **🚨 ARCHIVED**: This directory contains the **old Jekyll implementation** of Tech Hub. It is **no longer actively developed or maintained**.
>
> **DO NOT modify or use this code** for development. This is kept solely as a **reference implementation** for:
>
> - **Visual design**: Styling, colors, layouts, and UI patterns
> - **Configuration**: Settings and data structures that were used
> - **Content patterns**: How content was organized and displayed
> - **Inspiration**: Examples of how features were implemented
>
> **For active development**: Use the `.NET implementation` in the root directory with the `@dotnet` agent. See [/.github/agents/dotnet.md](/.github/agents/dotnet.md).
>
> **For framework-agnostic principles**: See [/AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md).
