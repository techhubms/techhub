## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot rolled out additional integrations and improvements this week, furthering its shift from a code completion tool to an AI platform designed for developers. Enhancements reinforce recent releases (such as Grok Code Fast 1 and Claude Sonnet 4.5), strengthening Copilot’s use of multiple models, support for more IDEs, and automation features. Copilot now contributes to a broader range of developer workflows, including Pull Request creation, PowerShell scripting, legacy system updates, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent support.

### Core GitHub Copilot Developments and Integrations

With last week’s Grok Code Fast 1 release and IDE model selector updates, Copilot’s multi-model system now better supports switching between OpenAI, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Grok Code Fast 1. Claude Sonnet 4.5 is generally available across all Copilot plans, and Grok Code Fast 1 has expanded from preview to full support in GitHub.com, mobile apps, VS Code, JetBrains, Xcode, and Eclipse.

A new preview brings Copilot into SQL Server Management Studio 22, supporting T-SQL code suggestions and troubleshooting in line with earlier workflow additions. Commit message generation, previously in beta, is now broadly available, adding to Copilot’s growing automation features. Security functions like Autofix and AI-driven code review continue the focus on addressing vulnerabilities. Guidance is available for those migrating from deprecated Copilot knowledge bases to Copilot Spaces, detailing the migration timeline to support organizational planning.

### GitHub Copilot Integration in Visual Studio Code

Copilot’s integration with Visual Studio Code has expanded, building on recent agent features. Merge conflict resolution is now assisted by Copilot, providing input on both code branches.

Agent mode now enforces use of fully qualified tool names, aligning with the MCP protocol and registry improvements. The new Extensions Marketplace preview makes it easier to find MCP server backends. Copilot features display step-by-step reasoning and improved tooling for managing workflow approvals and navigation.

VS Code updates include enhanced keyboard shortcuts, system-aware profile detection, and stronger integration with test suites, all based on developer feedback. Collaboration continues to make agentic workflows smoother within the editor.

## AI

This week’s AI news centers around deeper integration of language models, agent frameworks, and cloud infrastructure, particularly on Azure. You’ll find updates to documentation automation, workload-focused model optimization, and infrastructure architecture, building a foundation for scalable and secure enterprise AI adoption.

### Azure AI Foundry: Model Development, Fine-Tuning, and Multimodal Expansion

Azure AI Foundry is positioned as the main hub for creating and managing AI applications. The latest release of LangChain v1 introduces initial Foundry support, improved agent APIs, and updated migration guides. Richer UI integration is now possible thanks to new structured content blocks, and expanded I/O supports text, images, files, and video for better functionality across real-world applications.

Highlights in fine-tuning include expanded support for Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT), a more cost-effective Developer Tier, easier APIs for LLM customization (such as GPT-4o), and accelerated evaluation and deployment. Code samples are provided for RFT, distillation, and multi-region rollout.

Azure AI Foundry introduces Sora 2 in public preview, letting organizations use a REST API to generate detailed, physics-aware video with audio. This makes secure, scalable content generation for education and marketing simpler, following updates to Azure’s multimodal support.
