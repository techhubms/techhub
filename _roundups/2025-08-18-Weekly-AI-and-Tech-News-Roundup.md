## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot reached important milestones this week, including progress in advanced model integration, enterprise workflow automation, and extending its platform coverage. Copilot is gradually shifting from an in-line code assistant to a more autonomous developer tool. Organizations are seeing improved security, policy control, and automation that fit into professional workflows.

### GPT-5 and Advanced Model Options Transform Copilot

After the initial GPT-5 rollout last week, Copilot extended GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 support to more major IDEs: Visual Studio, JetBrains, Xcode, and Eclipse. This broader coverage allows more developers to access advanced review, onboarding, multi-file reasoning, and project-wide refactoring. Key updates include unlimited premium access for students and paid users through GPT-5 mini, along with improved administrative controls available on all platforms.
