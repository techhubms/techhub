## Security

Security coverage this week centers on defending the software supply chain, cloud hardening, agent identity controls, and updated developer tools for risk management. As attacks involving AI and regulatory changes become more frequent, teams face growing pressure to reinforce automated workflows and compliance.

### Modern Supply Chain Threats and the Role of AI

A new multi-stage attack targeted Nx and npm, using stolen tokens and compromised GitHub workflows to deploy malicious packages—with AI-driven reconnaissance marking the first public case of LLMs used for open source exploits. This incident affected over 5,500 repositories and triggered stronger 2FA requirements, Trusted Publisher policies, and workflow security. Upcoming EU regulations require machine-readable SBOMs and regular vulnerability disclosures by December 2027, prompting an increased focus on automating compliance checks and securing DevOps processes.
