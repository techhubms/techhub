## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot received new updates, including open sourcing of its VS Code extension, expanded control over AI models, and integrations focused on transparency for developers. Automation, security, and configuration options now better support individual and enterprise needs. Tutorials highlight Copilot's role in telecom APIs, certification study, and open source development. Copilot continues to evolve as a flexible AI coding platform, assisted by community contributions and support for additional models.

### VS Code Copilot Extension: Open Source, Custom Modes, and Deep Customization

Following last week’s focus on MCP integration and workflow automation, the VS Code Copilot Extension is now open source, discussed in detail by Microsoft’s Burke Holland. Community access allows developers to contribute new features and refine daily Copilot usage in VS Code. Custom Modes support tailored AI responses and performance for specific developer workflows. Advanced users can enable 'Beast Mode' in VS Code Insiders to experiment with prompt engineering and agent tuning.

These improvements build on last week’s MCP-driven automation. Guides and documentation on Custom Modes offer hands-on prompt engineering instructions. Open sourcing welcomes contributions such as code fixes and feature suggestions, letting users directly affect Copilot’s development. Initial coverage explains the extensibility available for customizing Copilot behavior.

### GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code: New Features, AI Models, Security, and Workflow Enhancements

After agent and prompt file improvements last week, Visual Studio Code August 2025 (v1.104) introduces more Copilot upgrades for streamlined coding and improved security. Copilot Chat now automatically selects among AI models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini Pro 2.5), enhancing suggestion accuracy and dealing with rate limits; manual model selection is also possible. Team collaboration gets refinements such as an advanced agent system, reusable prompts, device-wide toggles, and chat enhancements including KaTeX math rendering and custom fonts. Extension authors benefit from finalized LanguageModelChatProvider APIs and improved authentication.

For security, agent mode prompts users before modifying protected files, and organizations can adjust approvals for terminal commands. Changed files are now easier to review with collapsible lists, and expanded AGENTS.md support allows detailed Copilot usage standards. These additions align with productivity and high-control needs for large and security-sensitive teams.

### Expanded AI Model Support and BYOK Flexibility

Extending last week’s updates for organizational customization, Copilot now supports OpenAI GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini—GPT-5 mini for Free users, GPT-5 for paid subscriptions. A new model picker UI lets developers and organizations choose models on GitHub.com, VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and GitHub Mobile. IT administrators can set defaults centrally. This lets users and teams adjust Copilot for anything from basic scripting to complex code generation.

Copilot now supports Bring Your Own Key (BYOK), available in public preview for JetBrains IDEs and Xcode. Developers can use their own API keys for Azure, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, and OpenRouter—enabling model experimentation and better quota management. Teams can customize Copilot Chat and try out new models before they’re fully supported, with ongoing community feedback shaping future IDE integrations.

### GitHub Copilot Coding Agent and Agentic Workflows

Building on agent-driven automation and MCP connections from last week, Copilot’s agent now acts as a coding teammate—running code fixes, refactoring, and other pull request tasks. Developers assign agent tasks via Issues, VS Code, or a special panel, using ephemeral GitHub Actions runners for safe, isolated work. Agents’ changes are reviewed and run through CI before approval, maintaining secure standards. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides expanded context for improved results. Teams get management over assignments, audits, and branch protection, with guides outlining setup and scaling.

### Automatic Code Review and Administration with Copilot and MCP

Copilot’s new repository rule allows separate automatic code review from merge requirements. Repository admins can get early feedback and frequent code quality checks tailored to different rule sets, supporting productivity and flexible coverage—useful for regulated projects.

The MCP remote server (now generally available) links Copilot agents, GitHub workflows, and large language models. Security features include secret scanning, code scanning, and automated advisories. Enterprises can set internal registry and allowlist controls for MCP servers via Copilot in VS Code Insiders, regulating AI endpoint access. These changes make configuration easier and anticipate broader tool support, showing Copilot’s focus on balancing useful AI and governance.

## AI

Recent updates in AI center around hardware research, adoption of open standards, expanded low/no-code automation, and new developer integrations. Microsoft’s latest work enables more adaptable agent systems, hybrid developer experiences, and improved governance for enterprise AI. New research tackles infrastructure efficiency and scalable model deployments.

### AI Infrastructure: MOSAIC MicroLED Architecture

Microsoft Research introduced MOSAIC, an optical networking approach for data centers using bundles of slow microLED channels instead of a few fast ones. This increases throughput, reduces power use, and improves reliability—grouping thousands of channels can reach up to 3.2 Tbps while lowering costs and complexity for AI infrastructure. MicroLEDs also resist temperature problems and offer lower failure rates than lasers. MOSAIC is compatible with standard protocols, simplifying integration. Full details are available in technical papers.

### Automated Code and Secrets Security for Developers

GitHub’s CodeQL 2.23.0 now detects Rust log/path injection, broadens data modelling, and enhances detection across C/C++, C#, Java, and Python. Updates auto-deploy with code scanning to all supported languages. GitHub Enterprise Cloud introduces secret scanning validity checks for new tokens, helping teams spot exposed active secrets.

Hush Security’s platform replaces persistent application secrets with dynamic, just-in-time identity validation (using CNCF SPIFFE), supporting policy migration and automated secret management—helpful for teams running microservices or AI workloads under zero trust.

Following recent expansions in automated scanning, these updates improve detection, clarify secret validity, and reinforce best practices for secure deployment.

### Security Vulnerabilities in Developer Tools and AI Coding Workflows

A vulnerability in Cursor AI lets `"runOn": "folderOpen"` tasks execute shell commands from untrusted repos due to Workspace Trust being disabled by default. Recommended practices: enable Workspace Trust, update configurations, check for auto-execution risks, and work with unfamiliar projects only in isolated environments. The incident highlights increased risk in AI-powered developer tools and the need for careful policy updating.

This maintains last week’s focus on reviewing AI and CI tool security policies as automation use increases.
