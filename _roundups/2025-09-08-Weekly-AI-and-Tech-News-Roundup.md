## DevOps

This week’s DevOps news addresses better API resource management, as GitHub adds new policies for its GraphQL API. With increased automation and integrations, GitHub is updating its resource governance to help developers manage complexity as usage levels grow.

Following last week’s changes to repository migration and admin controls, the new resource limits for the GraphQL API support reliable performance and managed automation. Developers are encouraged to revisit and optimize their API queries.

### GitHub GraphQL API Resource Limits

GitHub’s GraphQL API now applies limits to computational cost, not just request rates. These execution resource limits impact queries that analyze large datasets, use nested relations, or request many pages at once. If integrations or scripts go over the limits, partial results and error messages are returned. Efficient queries can continue as usual, but resource-intensive requests will require refactoring to follow the new guidelines.

The updated policy helps make resource use fairer, maintains platform infrastructure, and encourages scalable API integration.
