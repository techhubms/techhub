## GitHub Copilot

This week, GitHub Copilot introduced new and updated features: deeper integration with Visual Studio and VS Code, expanded access to AI models such as Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 for chat and CLI use, and improvements to agent workflows. .NET and Azure users benefit from better performance analysis and modernization tools. Copilot’s improvements include enhanced analytics, prompt engineering, and rapid prototyping for enterprise teams, supporting the move to AI-assisted coding across desktop, web, terminal, and cloud for increased developer flexibility and efficiency.

### GitHub Copilot Integration in Visual Studio

Visual Studio 2022’s September 2025 release (v17.14) adds new capabilities for Copilot, pairing tools like the Profiler Agent and .NET Modernization Agent as part of ongoing agentic workflow automation. The Profiler Agent, accessible via Copilot Chat or the `@Profiler` command, delivers diagnostics and benchmarking, adding context-driven automation and performance review. Integrating BenchmarkDotNet simplifies modernization and Azure migration for .NET workloads.

Agent Mode produces faster responses and stronger context management, with better Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for extensibility and structured outputs. Features such as Mermaid diagram generation and code review promote collaborative development. The October roadmap highlights progress toward remote agents, MCP governance, group policy, and wider model support (Claude Sonnet 4.5, future GPT-5 Codex) as Visual Studio continues evolving as an AI-ready developer platform.

## AI

AI technology for developers saw new releases and expanded platform features, focusing on agentic models and enterprise automation. Microsoft Agent Framework now unifies orchestration experiences, integrating with Azure AI Foundry and Model Context Protocol (MCP). Grok 4 arrives on Azure AI Foundry with better reasoning and expanded context support. Updates center on improved automation, context retention, and data transformation, moving development teams from isolated models to modular, multi-agent workflows.

### Microsoft Agent Framework: Unified Agentic AI SDKs and Ecosystem Integrations

Microsoft Agent Framework is now in public preview, bringing a unified and open-source SDK for agentic AI to .NET and Python. This initiative, building on prior orchestration efforts like Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, simplifies multi-agent management. By supporting open protocols (MCP), developers gain modular context management, human-in-loop routing, thread-based state, and integrated Azure AI Foundry experiences.

Case studies such as automated audit workflows for KPMG Clara and voice-assisted services for Commerzbank show practical enterprise adoption. Community involvement in open-source development provides migration support from older agent SDKs. Observability via OpenTelemetry and security controls with Entra ID reinforce last week’s progress.
