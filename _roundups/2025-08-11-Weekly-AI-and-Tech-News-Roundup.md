## GitHub Copilot

Building on last week’s momentum in agent workflows and persistent memory, GitHub Copilot rolled out major updates, broadening its lead as an AI-powered developer tool. This week, public preview integrations for OpenAI GPT-5 and Anthropic Claude Opus 4.1 brought richer context-aware assistance and deepened enterprise and user controls. Enhanced VS Code workflows, improved pull request automation, and advances in customization and security continue to position Copilot as a standard for modern coding, while ongoing debates focus on transparency, cost, and workflow integration.

### Powerful AI Model Integrations Reshape Copilot

The public preview of GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1 into Copilot marks a significant upgrade, providing more nuanced code reasoning and advanced summarization. Paid Copilot tiers now access GPT-5—across github.com, VS Code, and GitHub Mobile—with administrators controlling model rollout for compliance. Anthropic’s Opus 4.1 boosts logic and summarization, and configurable organizational controls help teams adapt incrementally. Community feedback spotlights GPT-5’s value for analytic reviews and complex onboarding, but notes verbosity and inconsistent rollout, echoing ongoing discussions around quotas, transparency, and real-world deployment.
