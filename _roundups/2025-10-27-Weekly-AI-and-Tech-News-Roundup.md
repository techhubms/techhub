## GitHub Copilot

This week’s GitHub Copilot updates focus on increased speed, better model accuracy, model management features, and new workflow improvements. The developer community saw technical advances and practical guides for deploying tailored AI models, greater extension support in VS Code, and deeper analysis of Copilot’s place in real-world development. Tutorials and feature highlights show how Copilot is used both as a coding assistant and a link for agentic workflows, cloud migration, documentation help, and creative development.

### Speed, Model Accuracy, and Copilot Integration Updates

Building on the recent rollout of GPT-4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4.5, GitHub made further advances in model training and benchmarking. Fine-tuning and custom reinforcement learning for fill-in-the-middle tasks enhance context-sensitive results. These improvements led to a 20% increase in accepted code, 12% higher suggestion acceptance, and higher speed, positioning Copilot as a multi-model platform for intelligent automation. The updates are now available in Copilot-compatible IDEs, offering developers faster, more automated workflows.

The October VS Code AI Toolkit update (v0.24.0) tightens Copilot's editor integration, allowing Copilot Tools to be used directly within VS Code. New features like the Agent Evaluation Planner and Runner simplify analysis of metrics and results, reducing tool-switching and supporting context-driven tasks as mentioned in previous roundups.

- [AI Toolkit for VS Code October Update: GitHub Copilot Tools Integration](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-developer-community/ai-toolkit-for-vs-code-october-update/ba-p/4463365)

### Model Choice and Agentic AI Platform Extensions

Increasing options for multi-model support and agentic workspaces, VS Code now provides Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) and the Language Model Chat Provider API. This opens up new choices for enterprise and open-source models such as Hugging Face, Ollama, and Cerebras, in addition to existing support for OpenAI, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Grok Code Fast 1. Support for modular AI assistance keeps growing; note that code completion is not yet available for BYOK.

Copilot’s Planning mode preview in Visual Studio 2022 offers hierarchical, editable prompt plans with models including GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4. User feedback on live editing continues to drive improvements in agentic workflows.

Copilot is retiring older Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini models, continuing the changes discussed in previous updates. Teams should update to newer models to ensure continued compatibility, and broader Claude Haiku 4.5 support (now in all Copilot plans and IDEs) helps tailor workflow fit.

### Copilot Workflow Guides, Advanced Usage, and MCP Integration

New guides on prompt engineering and context management, such as the Persona Pattern guide, build on last week’s information regarding prompt versioning and .prompt.md usage. The focus remains on accuracy and productivity, and aligns with recent best practices.

Copilot’s integration into agentic AI workflows for updating legacy Java and .NET applications continues the shift toward system upgrades and PowerShell automation. Real-world examples, automated upgrades, and Infrastructure-as-Code template generation mark Copilot’s increasing role in hybrid cloud migration, consistent with previous orchestration discussion.

MCP server extensions for VS Code provide faster documentation and quick database deployments, demonstrating better support for external data and APIs. This continues the evolution of secure, domain-specific suggestions featured in last week’s roundup.

A new GitHub Copilot Certification article reinforces responsible use, privacy, and test automation, extending earlier discussions on training, community education, and actual feature usage in development.

### Copilot in Live Coding, Community, and Creative Use Cases

GitHub Universe and the ‘For the Love of Code’ hackathon highlighted Copilot’s integration into practical events and creative open-source development, continuing the story from previous weeks. Live coding in VS Code provided chances to interact directly with tool creators and get actionable advice, further building on MCP community involvement.

Showcases of open-source projects using Copilot demonstrated both accessibility and unique deployment scenarios, following last week’s ‘No Bark’ case study. Tutorials on building a DJ app illustrated Copilot’s value for creative coding and prompt-driven experiments.

## AI

Recent AI developments include growth in agent frameworks, better cloud and edge integrations, and updates in automation and security. Microsoft’s platforms—Agent Framework, MCP, Copilot Studio, and Azure AI Foundry—continue to put agents at the core of cloud-native, privacy-aware, and edge scenarios. Updates include new patterns in multi-agent orchestration, ongoing monitoring, signals-driven adjustments, and lifecycle management, with concrete progress on developer productivity and compliance.

### Microsoft Agent Framework: From Application Upgrades to Multi-Agent Enterprise Orchestration

Advancing last week’s discussion of MCP and agent-based workflows, Agent Framework adds more features and new integration options. Step-by-step guides and workshops help developers move from older Semantic Kernel and Blazor chat applications to orchestrated, multi-agent solutions in .NET 9. Support for enterprise orchestration—including sequential and concurrent workflow patterns—continues the focus on modularity. OpenTelemetry and DevUI integrations improve observability, while hosting agents on Azure App Service and using Cosmos DB for agent state expand guidance toward scalable, production deployments.

Multi-agent coordination with MCP and audit features carry forward the open-source registry approach for enterprise adoption. New SentinelStep and SentinelBench tools are maturing agent lifecycle and reliability standards for sustained workloads.

## ML

Recent progress in machine learning underlines improvements in model fine-tuning and deployment, emphasizing vision-language models (VLMs) for image classification on Azure AI Foundry. Developers are given clearer steps for achieving better accuracy, controlling costs, and supporting production deployments.

### Fine-Tuning GPT-4o Vision-Language Models on Azure AI Foundry

A new guide covers fine-tuning GPT-4o for image classification (using Stanford Dogs), continuing last week’s push for performance and usability in ML stacks. The tutorial covers data formatting in Azure JSONL, using Batch Inference API for large workloads (with higher latency and reduced cost), and connects to past automation topics drawn from Microsoft Fabric.

Instructions include using the Vision Fine-Tuning API to adapt GPT-4o for breed identification. The inclusion of public code samples and templates supports research and encourages wider use, echoing Azure ML’s focus on analytics and efficiency. Demonstrated results improved accuracy from 61.67% (CNN) to 82.67% for a fine-tuned model, with a detailed breakdown of cost and latency to help with deployment planning.

Production guidance centers around Azure’s security and scalability, detailing parameter adjustment, throughput, and best practices. Open-source code and Azure documentation make this a practical resource for ML engineers.
