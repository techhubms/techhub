## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot continues its transition from basic code completion toward agent-powered automation, cloud modernization, and context-driven software development. Developers now have more choice with new models, such as GPT-5-Codex and Claude Opus 4.1, alongside further Copilot improvements and extended IDE support. The platform is aligning with open standards focused on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to improve automation, compatibility, and extensibility. These upgrades include updates for command-line tools, VS Code, enterprise tracking, SQL development, and cloud migration workflows for Java and .NET. As legacy models and extensions get phased out, developers are encouraged to move to the latest approaches and integrate Copilot more deeply into team-oriented, automated workflows.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP): Standardization and Ecosystem Transition

GitHub will remove support for Copilot Extensions as GitHub Apps by November 2025 and recommends full migration to MCP servers. This transition takes the ecosystem from initial registry features to a protocol-focused structure, allowing developers to reuse MCP integrations more easily across agents for increased interoperability. Recent registry changes reinforce this approach. The latest MCP IDE guides encourage developers to review migration documentation and shift to MCP standards—for scalable, maintainable workflows and future agentic development. The MCP registry is now positioned as a foundation for Copilot's ongoing development.
