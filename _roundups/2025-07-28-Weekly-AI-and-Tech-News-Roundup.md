## GitHub Copilot

This week marked major leaps in Copilot’s automation, customization, and workflow integration—positioning it as a vital productivity platform. Developers gained smarter Git automation, context-driven code review, and new tools for rapid prototyping and modernization, while staying alert to upcoming configuration changes.

### Coding Agent Capabilities and Workflow Automation

Copilot’s coding agent advanced with enhanced Git workflow automation and tighter Visual Studio Code integration. The new PowerShell workflow prompt introduces AI-generated commit messages, advanced branch protections, and seamless server automation—streamlining daily repository management with hands-free, multi-step execution and robust error handling. Upcoming Visual Studio Code v1.103 will require a shift from legacy allow/deny-lists to a unified `autoApprove` configuration, prompting early migration to maintain workflow continuity.

Copilot agents now support custom base branch selection in automated PRs, accommodating complex CI/CD and branching requirements. Expanded session tracking, Playwright MCP server integration, and improved remote support boost scalability and transparency for large teams.

### Custom Instructions and Contextual Guidance

Copilot now features distributed `.instructions.md` support, letting teams issue granular, context-sensitive directives at any folder or file level. This upgrades the prior monolithic instructions approach, enabling nuanced control for builds, lints, and tests—resulting in higher quality automated PRs and less manual intervention. Accessible in public preview across interfaces, this boosts applicability in varied workflows.

### Rapid Prototyping and App Modernization

The debut of GitHub Spark (public preview) allows Copilot Pro+ users to convert natural language ideas into fully deployed full-stack apps—eliminating much of the planning and configuration overhead with AI-driven code and infra generation. Early adopters highlight its versatility for experimentation and MVP workflows.

Simultaneously, Copilot’s .NET app modernization tool, also in public preview, leverages AI to automate assessment and remediation for moving legacy .NET apps to Azure—minimizing manual labor and risk in cloud migrations. These innovations further Copilot’s role in enabling safe, rapid modernization for enterprise workloads.

## AI

This week’s AI highlights centered on agent interoperability, open source access, and enterprise adoption, amplifying practical AI deployment across technical and vertical domains.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration and Protocol Standardization

Complex agent systems advanced via Microsoft’s Semantic Kernel and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol—an emerging standard for secure, discoverable agent communication. Together with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), developers can now compose resilient, orchestrated agent workflows that interoperate across systems like LangGraph and Azure AI Foundry. Open-source guides enable cloud-native agent orchestration, unified error handling, and plugin-based task routing, solidifying practical multi-agent automation (continuing the MCP workflows covered last week).

- [Building Agent-to-Agent Communication with MCP: Capabilities, Patterns, and Implementation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/blog/can-you-build-agent2agent-communication-on-mcp-yes)

### Open Source AI Access and Infrastructure

GitHub Models launched a free OpenAI-compatible inference API, letting open source projects easily embed AI features using GitHub token authentication—eliminating the need for self-hosting or extra secrets, and democratizing AI in development and CI/CD environments.

Microsoft also previewed Fabric data agents in Copilot Studio, enabling multi-agent automation inside enterprise data pipelines, reducing manual bottlenecks and boosting reliability. These steps expand the MCP and multi-agent ecosystems highlighted previously.

## Security

Security headlines focused on urgent SharePoint server exploits, unified threat detection infrastructure, and technical best practices for AI and automation architectures.

### Urgent SharePoint Server Vulnerabilities and Mitigation

Microsoft warned of active state-backed attacks on on-premises SharePoint Servers (CVE-2025-53770, CVE-2025-49704), involving privilege escalation, web shells, key theft, and ransomware attempts. Immediate measures include patching, deploying Defender and AMSI, rotating keys, and monitoring for compromise—all reinforcing the ongoing need for rigorous, layered defenses.
