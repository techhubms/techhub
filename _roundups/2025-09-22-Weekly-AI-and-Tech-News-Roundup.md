## Coding

Coding updates this week focus on practical improvements for .NET developers, tool packaging strategies, performance, and changes to support life cycles. As .NET 10 nears release, content covers actionable planning advice for evolving within the .NET ecosystem.

### .NET 10 Tool Packaging, WebAssembly, and Support Lifecycle Changes

Andrew Lock’s expanded coverage from last week’s .NET 10 RC1 preview addresses platform-specific tool packaging, new schemas for DotnetToolSettings.xml, and approaches for dual packaging to maintain support for older SDKs, as illustrated by Datadog and NativeAOT examples—continuing migration support started earlier.

The latest ASP.NET Community Standup covers .NET 10’s WebAssembly runtime, outlining performance enhancements and migration tactics that build upon last week’s component feature improvements.

Microsoft will extend .NET Standard Term Support to 24 months beginning with .NET 9, directly addressing prior migration challenges and adopting past recommendations for update planning.

## DevOps

Recent DevOps coverage highlights workflow automation, higher code quality, and improved security. Updates include GitHub Actions and Dependabot features, migration advice, advancements in AI-powered automation, modern workflow strategies, and enhanced platform security.

### GitHub Actions and Dependabot Enhancements

GitHub Actions now features YAML anchor support and can use workflow templates from private repositories, streamlining complex CI/CD automation and internal sharing. A new job context variable (`check_run_id`) helps target build artifacts and notifications, reducing setup complexity. Dependabot adds support for Conda `environment.yml` files so Python/science projects now automate vulnerability and version updates, enhancing supply chain protections.

These changes build on last week’s automation transparency and secure workflow improvements.

## Security

This week’s security updates highlight more sophisticated supply chain attacks and stronger platform controls, with vendor improvements addressing code safety, governance, identity management, and quantum-era risks.

### Malicious Extension Threats in Developer Ecosystems

Investigations reveal the WhiteCobra group distributing advanced malicious VSCode and Open VSX Marketplace extensions, following last week’s focus on AI tool security. WhiteCobra employs payloads split across helper files and scripts to circumvent static analysis, with LummaStealer stealing wallets, credentials, and cloud accounts. Automated fake reviews, cross-market spreading (Cursor/Windsurf), and multi-OS payloads escalate risks, including some targeting Ethereum contributors. Experts recommend exacting extension screening, stronger monitoring, and improved supply chain security.
