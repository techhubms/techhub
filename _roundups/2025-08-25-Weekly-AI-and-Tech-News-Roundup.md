## Coding

Developers benefit this week from updated toolchains and workflow features, helping with modernization and streamlining in both Git and .NET. Git delivers new storage and workflow improvements, while .NET introduces new approaches for testing, migration, and UI challenges.

### Git 2.51: Storage, Workflow, and CLI Enhancements

Git 2.51 delivers enhancements to storage and workflow efficiency. The new cruft-free MIDX feature allows for duplication of reachable objects from cruft packs, resulting in smaller, faster repositories and up to 38% storage reduction. This is managed via the `repack.MIDXMustContainCruft` setting. The updated `git repack --path-walk` uses file layout to optimize delta compression and pack size.

A new stash interchange format allows linked ancestor commits, enabling stash export/import across devices. Scripting is improved via more accurate `git cat-file` submodule reporting; commit-graph Bloom filters offer accelerated path filtering in large repositories.

The commands `git switch` and `git restore` are now stable, while the deprecated `git whatchanged` is replaced by `git log --raw`. Looking ahead, Git 3.0 will default to SHA-256 and implement a new reftable backend, so users should start planning for migration. Updates to C99 support and patch submission workflows further modernize the codebase.

These updates maintain Git’s focus on workflow effectiveness and code modernization.
