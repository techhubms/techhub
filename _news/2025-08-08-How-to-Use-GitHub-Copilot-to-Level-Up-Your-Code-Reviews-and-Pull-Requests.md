# How to Use GitHub Copilot to Level Up Your Code Reviews and Pull Requests

_By Melissa Pastore_

Since joining GitHub’s billing team, I’ve observed the rapid evolution of AI-powered coding tools, especially GitHub Copilot. This article explores how Copilot extends far beyond code completion and now supports a wide range of engineering tasks, particularly around code reviews and pull requests (PRs).

## Copilot in the Code Review Workflow

Copilot has become a valuable asset at every stage of the software development lifecycle. Here are some techniques I use to incorporate Copilot into my workflow:

### 1. Generating Code Review Suggestions

- While reviewing teammates’ PRs, I use Copilot to suggest improvements for specific code blocks.
- For example, if I spot repetitive Ruby code, I prompt Copilot with _"Can you refactor this Ruby on Rails code to reduce repetition?"_ and include its suggestion in my code review comments.
- Copilot helps ensure best practices are followed, even when reviewing code in multiple languages like Ruby, TypeScript, or Go.
- Example prompt for Go: _"Is this code addition following Go best practices for variable assignment? If not, can you suggest improvements?"_

### 2. Automated Formatting for Data and Documentation

- Copilot is useful for turning spreadsheet data or performance results into Markdown tables for PR descriptions.
- Sample prompt: _"Format this data into a GitHub flavored markdown table that I can paste into a GitHub pull request description…"_
- Copilot generates ready-to-use Markdown, making it easier to communicate data in reviews.

### 3. Drafting Pull Request Summaries

- Copilot can generate initial summaries for PR descriptions, providing a starting point for documentation even when I'm in a hurry or facing writer’s block.
- Using the Copilot icon in the pull request editor streamlines summarizing changes.

### 4. Reviewing and Explaining Unfamiliar Code

- Before marking a PR as ready, I ask Copilot to review my own changes for potential improvements or missed issues.
- For unfamiliar changes made by others, Copilot explanations help me quickly grasp context and potential impact, making my feedback more effective.

## Copilot’s Impact on Developer Productivity

- Copilot streamlines code suggestions, refactors, Markdown formatting, and summary generation—freeing up time for high-level engineering work.
- Its integration across the software lifecycle transforms how developers collaborate and review code.
