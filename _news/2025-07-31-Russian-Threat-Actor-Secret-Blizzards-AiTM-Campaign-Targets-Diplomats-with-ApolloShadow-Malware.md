# Russian Threat Actor Secret Blizzard's AiTM Campaign Targets Diplomats with ApolloShadow Malware

## Overview

Microsoft Threat Intelligence details an advanced cyberespionage effort led by Russian state-sponsored group Secret Blizzard. Through an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) approach, Secret Blizzard compromised diplomatic networks in Moscow using the custom malware ApolloShadow, which establishes persistent access by installing fraudulent root certificates.

## Campaign Details

- **Target:** Foreign embassies and diplomatic entities operating in Moscow
- **Attack Vector:** AiTM via manipulation at ISP and telco infrastructure
- **Malware:** ApolloShadow, capable of root certificate installation to facilitate device trust bypass
- **Persistence:** Added an administrative user (UpdatusUser) and altered network/firewall configurations for ease of future access

### Technical Walkthrough

#### Initial Access

- Secret Blizzard utilizes ISP-level AiTM to redirect victims into captive portals
- Windows Test Connectivity triggers HTTP GET requests, redirected to attacker domains via DNS manipulation

#### Infection Process

- Victims receive certificate errors and are prompted to run an executable, *CertificateDB.exe*, masquerading as a Kaspersky AV installer
- On execution, ApolloShadow checks for administrative privileges, prompting privilege escalation via User Account Control (UAC) if needed

#### Data Exfiltration & Second Stage

- Collects IP/network info, double Base64-encoded and sent to a malicious C2 endpoint
- A VBScript payload is retrieved and executed to continue the compromise chain

#### Privilege Escalation & Persistence

- **Low privilege path:** Collects host/network info, delivers scripts
- **High privilege path:**
  - Alters Windows registry to set all networks to 'Private'
  - Enables specific firewall rules to relax host segmentation
  - Installs rogue root certificates (including for Firefox)
  - Creates a permanent admin user with a non-expiring password

#### Technical Indicators

- Obfuscated strings and process flows
- Use of legitimate system utilities (certutil, NetUserAdd) for malicious purposes
- Communication with C2 via DNS/Digicert endpoint redirection

### Recommendations for Defense

Microsoft’s blog offers actionable defense steps:

- **Use encrypted tunnels (VPN, satellite networks)** to shield traffic from local ISP monitoring
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict admin and privileged accounts
- **Enable MFA (multi-factor authentication)** and audit privileged group membership
- **Activate cloud-delivered protection** in Defender Antivirus
- **Turn on EDR in block mode** for real-time remediation
- **Apply Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules** and policies to block executables and scripts

#### Defender XDR Detections

- Look for:
  - Secret Blizzard activity alerts
  - Suspicious root certificate and certutil activity
  - Unknown admin users created
  - Scripts with anomalous content
- Example Kusto Query:

```kusto
let CaptiveRedirectEvents = DeviceNetworkEvents | where RemoteUrl contains "msftconnecttest.com/redirect" | project DeviceId, RedirectTimestamp = Timestamp, RemoteUrl;
let FileDownloadEvents = DeviceFileEvents | where ActionType == "FileDownloaded" | project DeviceId, DownloadTimestamp = Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath;
CaptiveRedirectEvents | join kind=inner (FileDownloadEvents) on DeviceId | where DownloadTimestamp between (RedirectTimestamp .. (RedirectTimestamp + 2m)) | project DeviceId, RedirectTimestamp, RemoteUrl, DownloadTimestamp, FileName, FolderPath
```

## Key Takeaways

- Russian threat group Secret Blizzard is leveraging ISP-level AiTM attacks in Russia
- Custom malware (ApolloShadow) performs root certificate injection, privilege escalation, and persistent backdoor
- Microsoft recommends comprehensive defense-in-depth—including Defender XDR, privilege control, and encrypted traffic routing
- Defender customers can leverage hunting queries and built-in detections for proactive monitoring
