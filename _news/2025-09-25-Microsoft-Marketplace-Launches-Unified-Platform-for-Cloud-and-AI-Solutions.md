# Microsoft Marketplace Launches Unified Platform for Cloud and AI Solutions

Microsoft has announced the launch of its reimagined [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com?ocid=cmmlvdg0mq9), a unified platform for discovering, purchasing, and deploying cloud solutions, AI apps, and agents. This update consolidates the Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource, simplifying how organizations access and manage solutions across the Microsoft Cloud.

## Key Announcements

- **Unified Marketplace**: Azure Marketplace and AppSource are now combined as the Microsoft Marketplace, streamlining discovery and deployment of tens of thousands of cloud and industry solutions.
- **Comprehensive Catalog**: Offers solutions spanning from data analytics and productivity to industry-specific needs, integrating with products like Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Microsoft Security.
- **AI Apps and Agents**: Now features over 3,000 AI apps and agents, including those built on Azure AI Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot, with rapid provisioning through industry standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Purchasing Flexibility**: Organizations can buy directly, through cloud service providers (CSPs), or via trusted partners. Channel integrations empower customers to use familiar procurement channels.
- **Integrated Deployment**: Solutions—including Copilot agents and Azure-based apps—can be provisioned and distributed within Microsoft products (e.g., Teams, Azure AI Foundry) with enterprise-grade management and governance.

## Real-World Impact

Siemens Digital Industries Software used Microsoft Marketplace to cut AI app configuration time from 20 minutes to just one minute, increasing productivity and adoption.

Mars Inc. leverages the Marketplace to find trusted, Azure-integrated solutions, boosting innovation while maintaining security standards.

## Partner Ecosystem Expansion

Partner integrations drive growth through digital sales, private and multiparty offers, and CSP integrations. Notable partners such as Arrow, Crayon, Ingram Micro, Pax8, and TD SYNNEX are expanding reach through the Marketplace. New capabilities like *resale enabled offers* are in preview to support channel-driven sales.

## Innovation and Control

Marketplace consolidates solutions and deployment within the Microsoft Cloud, ensuring that IT teams can manage innovation, governance, and security requirements from a single platform. Organizations with Azure Consumption Commitments can apply Marketplace purchases to their commitments, maximizing investment value.
