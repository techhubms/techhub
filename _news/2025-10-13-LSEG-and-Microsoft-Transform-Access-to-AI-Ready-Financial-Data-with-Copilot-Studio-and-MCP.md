# LSEG and Microsoft Transform Access to AI-Ready Financial Data with Copilot Studio and MCP

**Date:** October 13, 2025

## Overview

LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) and Microsoft have deepened their strategic partnership to deliver new ways for financial services organizations to leverage LSEG-licensed data within Microsoft solutions. The collaboration centers on enabling AI-powered agents and streamlined data integration through Microsoft Copilot Studio and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Key Highlights

- **Agents in Microsoft Copilot Studio**: Financial services professionals can build custom agents with Copilot Studio—a low-code platform for creating advanced AI agents. These agents can be deployed within Microsoft 365 Copilot, enhancing workflows with LSEG-licensed data and intelligent analytics.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: LSEG introduces a managed MCP server to provide secure, seamless access to licensed financial data. MCP is an open-source protocol that standardizes data connectivity, simplifying integration with third-party systems and internal AI workflows as well as Copilot Studio.
- **Data Security and Governance**: The solution provides governance controls and compliance support for integrating financial data into AI-powered workflows, ensuring secure customization at scale.
- **Scalable, AI-Ready Data**: LSEG’s “AI Ready Content” comprises over 33 petabytes of financial datasets, accessible for insights and advanced analytics in Microsoft 365 Copilot and other tools.

## How It Works

- **MCP Server and API Integration**: Customers connect Copilot Studio with LSEG APIs via the MCP server, enabling real-time and historical financial data to power custom AI agent logic.
- **Low-Code Customization**: Organizations can build and deploy agents by combining prompts, policies, and AI model reasoning inside a secure environment.
- **Industrywide Interoperability**: MCP supports data transfer and connectivity across multiple AI systems, reducing integration complexity and cost for enterprises.

## Customer Impact

- Enables secure, AI-driven decision-making using trusted, comprehensive LSEG data within Microsoft workflows.
- Streamlines the integration of financial data and AI tools, reducing technical barriers for financial services professionals.
