Allison details the new capability for GitHub Copilot coding agents to leverage self-hosted runners via Actions Runner Controller, enabling more customizable and secure development environments for automated coding workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Copilot Coding Agent Now Supports Self-Hosted Runners Using ARC

GitHub Copilot coding agents can now be configured to run in your organization's own infrastructure using self-hosted GitHub Actions runners managed by [Actions Runner Controller (ARC)](https://docs.github.com/actions/tutorials/use-actions-runner-controller/quickstart?utm_source=changelog-docs-cca-selfhosted-runners&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25). This latest enhancement provides greater flexibility and security, allowing Copilot agents access to private resources that aren't exposed to the public internet.

## What Is the Copilot Coding Agent?

The [Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent?utm_source=changelog-docs-cca-selfhosted-runners&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25) is a background, autonomous agent capable of performing development tasks asynchronously. When you delegate a task, it creates a draft pull request, performs edits, runs builds and tests, and then requests your reviewâ€”all from its own ephemeral development environment powered by GitHub Actions.

## Benefits of Self-Hosted Runner Support

- **Access Internal Resources:** Run workflows against infrastructure with access to internal packages and systems.
- **Customizable Environments:** Control the scale and configuration of runners using ARC-managed scale sets.
- **Security:** Keep sensitive assets inside your network while leveraging Copilot's automation features.

## How to Get Started

1. **Deploy Actions Runner Controller (ARC)** and configure your desired scale set by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/actions/tutorials/use-actions-runner-controller/quickstart?utm_source=changelog-docs-cca-selfhosted-runners&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25).
2. **Update Workflow Configuration:** Edit your `copilot-setup-steps.yml` to specify the ARC scale set as the `runs-on` target:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     copilot-setup-steps:
       runs-on: arc-scale-set-name
   ```

3. **Refer to [agent environment documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/customize-the-agent-environment?utm_source=changelog-docs-cca-selfhosted-runners&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25)** for guidance on advanced customization.

## Who Should Use This?

This update is beneficial for teams needing Copilot coding agents to interact securely with on-premises resources, or requiring granular control over runner environments for compliance or customization reasons.
