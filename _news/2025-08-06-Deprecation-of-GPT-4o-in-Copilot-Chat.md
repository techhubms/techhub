# Deprecation of GPT-4o in Copilot Chat

As of August 6, 2025, GitHub Copilot Chat no longer supports the GPT-4o model. Users of Copilot Chat (including ask, edit, and agent modes) in supported IDEs, on github.com/copilot, and within GitHub mobile apps are now directed to use the newer GPT-4.1 model.

## What's Changing?

- **GPT-4o is Deprecated**: The GPT-4o model is now removed for use in Copilot Chat features.
- **GPT-4.1 is the New Default**: Transition to GPT-4.1 is encouraged, offering improved performance and abilities over GPT-4o, especially in conversational AI tasks.
- **Scope**: This deprecation only affects Copilot Chat (across IDEs, web, and mobile). Standard code completions in Copilot still currently rely on GPT-4o.

- Join discussions and ask questions in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations).

## What Should You Do?

- Ensure Copilot Chat instances are upgraded to the newest model (GPT-4.1).
- Review documentation or changelogs if you notice differences in responses or behavior in Copilot Chat.
