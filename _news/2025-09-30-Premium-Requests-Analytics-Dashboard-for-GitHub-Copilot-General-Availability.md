# Premium Requests Analytics Dashboard for GitHub Copilot

GitHub's premium requests analytics dashboard, launching September 29, 2025, provides a detailed interface for tracking Copilot-related usage and billing. The tool enables enterprise owners, organization owners, billing managers, and personal Copilot subscribers to understand how their Copilot premium request consumption contributes to their overall invoices.

- **Cost Monitoring:** See gross and billed amounts both in aggregate and by category to identify cost drivers.
- **API Access:** Take advantage of the new dedicated API endpoint for exporting premium requests analytics data. Build custom reports, internal dashboards, and expense trackers to suit your organization's needs.
