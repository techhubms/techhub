# Microsoft Defender Leads Modern Endpoint Security Market for Third Consecutive Year

**Author:** Rob Lefferts

## Overview

For the third year in a row, Microsoft Defender has been ranked the number one endpoint security solution in the worldwide modern endpoint security market, according to IDC’s 2024 report. Microsoft’s market share rose to 28.6% in 2024, reflecting a 28.2% year-over-year growth amidst a surge in global ransomware activity.

## Why Organizations Prefer Microsoft Defender

- **Cross-Platform Support:** Ongoing investments have enhanced Defender’s support for diverse Linux distributions, ARM64 architecture, and low-resource environments, minimizing CPU usage and boosting performance.
- **Advanced Security Capabilities:** Features such as next-generation protection, built-in exposure management, attack path analysis, and automatic attack disruption improve proactive defense, detect vulnerabilities, and halt in-progress threats.
- **Security Operations Center Enablement:** Defender's platform offers security operations teams real-time analytics, dynamic risk scoring, attack disruption, live response, and advanced hunting across languages and dialects worldwide.
- **Customer Success Stories:** Organizations like Crocs, Victorinox, Del Monte Foods, and Cielo have experienced accelerated security maturity and operational simplicity with Defender’s native integration.

## Microsoft Defender Platform Highlights

- **Defense-in-Depth:** Built-in self-defense capabilities stop lateral threat movement and contain cyberattacks across various domains, with or without additional Microsoft security deployments.
- **Analytics and Investigation:** Provides in-depth telemetry, investigation, and remediation tooling for continuous improvement of security posture.
- **Global Reach:** The Defender portal and resources are available in over 100 languages, supporting analysts around the world.
