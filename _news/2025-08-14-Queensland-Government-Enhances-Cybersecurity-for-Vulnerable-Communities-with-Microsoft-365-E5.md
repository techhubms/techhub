stclarke outlines the Queensland Government's journey in transforming its cybersecurity posture by consolidating tools under Microsoft 365 E5, deploying Defender and Sentinel, and aligning with modern security practices for greater data protection.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Queensland Government Enhances Cybersecurity for Vulnerable Communities

## Overview

The Queensland Department of Families, Seniors, Disability Services and Child Safety is responsible for providing critical support services to vulnerable populations, including child protection and elder abuse prevention. Handling sensitive data daily, the department recognized a growing need for stronger, more unified cybersecurity measures in response to emerging threats like generative AI and increased cyber risk.

## Security Challenges

- **Highly sensitive data:** Case notes for child safety, domestic violence records, and disability services information require robust protection and compliant handling.
- **Diverse workforce:** About 9,500 employees across various agencies and locations handle confidential records, calling for security solutions that minimize workflow disruption.

## Microsoft 365 E5 Upgrade

To consolidate and simplify its security stack, the department upgraded to **Microsoft 365 E5**, replacing a patchwork of legacy tools with a unified Microsoft-based platform:

- Eliminated fragmented security solutions from multiple vendors
- Streamlined incident visibility and remediation through a single pane of glass

## Deployment of Microsoft Defender Suite

Utilizing the Defender XDR suite, the department implemented:

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**: Enhanced security for servers and desktops, with plans for mobile devices
- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**: Improved cloud service and application monitoring
- **Defender for Identity** & **Office 365**: Protected against identity theft, email attacks, and threats to collaboration tools
- **Windows Defender Application Control**: Helped meet government compliance mandates (e.g., Essential Eight)

Progress and improvements are monitored via the **Microsoft Defender portal** and reported through **Microsoft Secure Score**, enabling teams to target remediation efforts efficiently.

## Security Operations Centralized with Microsoft Sentinel

Migrating to **Microsoft Sentinel** has allowed the department to:

- Centralize incident detection, response, and management
- Automate responses to recurring security incidents
- Integrate telemetry from Defender and other tools for unified monitoring and action

## Advancing Zero Trust and Data Protection

- Adopting a **Zero Trust** security model for continuous improvement
- Planning further expansion of **Microsoft Purview** for Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and governance, especially as generative AI becomes more prevalent

## Partnership and Outcomes

- Strong cooperation with Microsoft and Capgemini enabled a fast transformation
- Rapid deployment and out-of-the-box security capabilities improved operational efficiency
- Ongoing improvements and feature updates from Microsoft deliver continued value

## Conclusion

The department's shift to an integrated Microsoft security ecosystem has resulted in greater protection for sensitive community data, improved efficiency for a small security operations team, and a foundation for future innovation as threats evolve.
