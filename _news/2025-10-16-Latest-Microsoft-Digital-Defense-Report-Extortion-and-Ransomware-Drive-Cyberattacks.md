# Latest Microsoft Digital Defense Report: Extortion and Ransomware Drive Cyberattacks

Microsoft’s 2025 Digital Defense Report provides a comprehensive view of global cyber threats from July 2024 to June 2025. Written with Chief Information Security Officer Igor Tsyganskiy, the report details a significant shift in attack motives and highlights new trends driven by both attackers and defenders—including the critical role of AI in today’s threat landscape.

## Key Findings

- **Financial Motivation Dominates:** 80% of investigated incidents involved data theft, and at least 52% of attacks with known motives were driven by extortion or ransomware. Only 4% focused solely on espionage.
- **Evolving Tactics with AI and Automation:** Both sophisticated and opportunistic attackers leverage AI and automation to accelerate malware development, create synthetic content, and improve phishing attacks.
- **Critical Services Under Attack:** Hospitals, local governments, and other essential services are targets due to limited security budgets and legacy infrastructure. Attacks have caused real-world disruptions in medical care, education, and transportation.
- **Nation-State Actors Expanding Operations:** China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea increased their cyber operations, targeting not just government agencies but also commercial organizations, academia, and NGOs. State-affiliated actors have become faster at exploiting new vulnerabilities and are increasingly leveraging cybercriminal tools.
- **AI as a Double-Edged Sword:** Generation AI enables more effective phishing, social engineering, and adaptive malware. At the same time, AI helps defenders at Microsoft identify threats faster, reduce detection gaps, and mitigate attacks.
- **Credential Attacks Surge:** 97% of identity attacks are password-based, with a 32% rise in identity-based attacks in early 2025. Infostealer malware is increasing, giving criminals access to bulk credentials and session tokens for large-scale account compromise.
- **Importance of Modern Defenses:** Legacy security measures are insufficient. Strategies like phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), AI-driven detection, and industry-government collaboration are essential. MFA can block 99% of identity-based attacks.
- **Shared Responsibility:** Security is not just a technical problem—it is a strategic and governance imperative. Microsoft advocates for collective action involving government policy, industry standards, incident collaboration, and transparent attribution of nation-state threats.

## Real-World Impact Examples

- Hospitals and local governments faced disruption of critical services, such as emergency medical care and school operations.
- Ransomware actors exploit time-sensitive scenarios and sensitive data to demand payment, especially from under-resourced organizations.
- Nation-state actors target supply chains, communications networks, NGOs, and commercial shipping for espionage and strategic influence.

## Defensive Actions and Recommendations

- **Adopt Modern Security Tools:** Use AI-driven detection, advanced threat protection, and update to resilient systems.
- **Enable MFA:** Especially phishing-resistant variants, as they block the majority of credential attacks.
- **Stay Informed and Collaborate:** Monitor threat intelligence, share data with peers, and coordinate with public agencies.
- **Address Governance and Policy:** Governments must back technical measures with clear consequences for malicious activities and set strong cybersecurity standards.
