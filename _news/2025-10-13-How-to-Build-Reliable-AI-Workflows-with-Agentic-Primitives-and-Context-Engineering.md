# How to Build Reliable AI Workflows with Agentic Primitives and Context Engineering

AI-native development requires moving beyond ad-hoc prompt experimentation. This guide from Daniel Meppiel walks developers through a practical, three-layer framework that brings reliability, scale, and discipline to AI engineering by combining markdown-based prompt engineering, agentic primitives, and advanced context management.

## 1. The AI-Native Development Framework

**Three layers form the foundation:**

- **Markdown Prompt Engineering:** Use Markdown (headers, bullets, links) to structure prompts for clarity and predictability.
- **Agentic Primitives:** Develop reusable modules (like `.instructions.md`, `.prompt.md`) that encapsulate behaviors, rules, and workflows for AI agents.
- **Context Engineering:** Manage and optimize the information your AI agents use, focusing their attention, reducing noise, and improving output reliability.

---

## 2. Layer 1: Markdown Prompt Engineering

- **Context Loading:** Use links to inject specific context or resources into the prompt.
- **Structured Thinking:** Headings and lists formalize reasoning paths for AI outputs.
- **Role Activation:** Assign explicit roles (e.g., “expert debugger”) to tailor agent behavior.
- **Tool Integration:** Invoke MCP tools to execute code or queries in a managed, safe way.
- **Validation Gates:** Insert approval steps to ensure human review at decision points.

#### Example Prompt Structure

```markdown
You are an expert debugger, specialized in debugging complex programming issues.

Follow these steps:
1. Review error logs.
2. Use the `azmcp-monitor-log-query` tool to query infrastructure logs from Azure.
3. Identify root cause and consider three solutions with trade-offs.
4. Present root cause and solutions to the user for validation before making fixes.
```

---

## 3. Layer 2: Agentic Primitives

Agentic primitives are modular, configurable files that implement instructions, workflow steps, or domain-specific rules:

- **`.instructions.md`:** Project/global or domain-specific rules.
- **`.chatmode.md`:** Domain boundaries and tool access control.
- **`.prompt.md`:** Workflow orchestration with validation checkpoints.
- **`.spec.md`:** Feature or change specification blueprints.
- **`.memory.md` & `.context.md`:** State persistence and context management.

**Native VS Code support:** These primitives are recognized and leveraged by VS Code and GitHub Copilot, and can be managed using CLI and package managers like APM.

---

## 4. Layer 3: Context Engineering

- **Session Splitting:** Use different agent sessions for planning, implementation, and testing to preserve clarity.
- **Modular Instructions:** Apply targeted rules using `applyTo` YAML frontmatter.
- **Memory-Driven Development:** Maintain project knowledge and decisions across sessions.
- **Context Optimization:** Custom `.context.md` files accelerate retrieval and focus LLM attention.

---

## 5. Tooling & Scale with CLI and APM

- **Agent CLI Runtimes:** Run agentic workflows outside VS Code, e.g., with GitHub Copilot CLI for automation and integration into CI/CD.
- **APM (Agent Package Manager):** Unified runtime management, package distribution, and dependency handling—similar to npm for natural language programs.

#### Sample APM Workflow

```bash
apm runtime setup copilot # Installs Copilot CLI
apm install               # Installs dependencies
apm compile               # Compiles agent primitives to Agents.md
apm run copilot-sec-review --param pr_id=123
```

---

## 6. Distribution, Configuration, and CI/CD Integration

- **Distribute agent primitives** as packages with version control and managed dependencies.
- **Project configuration** via `apm.yml`, specifying scripts, tools, and parameters.
- **Automate agentic workflows** in production with APM GitHub Actions, embedding AI-powered checks into CI pipelines for reliability and scalability.

#### Example GitHub Action

```yaml
jobs:
  security-analysis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Security Review
        uses: danielmeppiel/action-apm-cli@v1
        with:
          script: copilot-sec-review
          parameters: |
            { "pr_id": "${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}" }
```

---

## 7. Instructions Architecture, Chat Modes, and Specification Templates

- Split instructions by domain/scope for relevance and context efficiency.
- Define chat modes to enforce professional boundaries (e.g., frontend vs. backend vs. architect roles).
- Standardize feature specs as checklists for deterministic handoff from planning to execution.

#### Folder/Configuration Example

```markdown
.github/
├── copilot-instructions.md
└── instructions/
    ├── frontend.instructions.md
    ├── backend.instructions.md
    └── testing.instructions.md
```

---

## 8. Quickstart Checklist

1. Learn principles of markdown prompt engineering.
2. Apply context engineering strategy (context window optimization).
3. Write clear `.instructions.md` rules and configure chat modes.
4. Orchestrate workflows with `.prompt.md` files.
5. Use tools like APM to manage, package, and distribute workflows.
6. Integrate agentic workflows into your team’s CI/CD pipelines.

## Summary

By combining agentic primitives, structured prompt design, and robust context management, you can transition from AI experimentation to building reliable, scalable AI-powered workflows with GitHub Copilot, Copilot CLI, and supporting tooling. This approach enables teams to develop, automate, and share intelligent processes as easily as traditional code.
