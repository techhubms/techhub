## Copilot Chat Unlocks Powerful Repository Management Skills in GitHub

**Author:** Allison

### Overview

Copilot Chat on GitHub.com has received major enhancements that make it significantly more powerful for repository workflows. With these improvements, developers can now manage their codebases more efficiently without leaving the chat interface.

### Key New Capabilities

- **Create, Update, and Push Files:**
  - Developers can describe desired changes to code, README files, or any project file in plain language. Copilot Chat will then create or update those files as requested, streamlining changes and reducing the need for context switching.
  - *Example workflow:* “Add a new section to the README describing how to contribute.”

- **Create Branches:**
  - Start new feature work or experiments by instructing Copilot Chat to create branches directly in the repository.
  - *Example workflow:* “Start a branch for the bug fix described in issue #123.”

- **Merge Pull Requests:**
  - Developers can request Copilot Chat's help to merge open pull requests, facilitating seamless integration of code changes.
  - *Example workflow:* “Can you merge the open PR for the feature/signup branch?”

### Getting Started

To leverage the new capabilities, users can simply ask Copilot Chat to perform tasks such as editing documentation, starting branches, or merging code updates—all from within chat. This helps consolidate GitHub workflows and reduces the need to constantly switch between different UI sections.

### Impact

With these updates, the entire development workflow—spanning concept, code, and deployment—becomes accessible within your ongoing GitHub conversation. Copilot Chat acts as a collaborative assistant, allowing more natural and efficient project management, right where your ideas are born.

**Try out these new skills today and experience a more unified GitHub development environment!**
