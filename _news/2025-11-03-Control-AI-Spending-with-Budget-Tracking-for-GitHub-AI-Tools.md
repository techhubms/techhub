# Control AI Spending with Budget Tracking for GitHub AI Tools

**Author: Allison**

GitHub is launching enhanced budget tracking and management features for its popular AI development tools, including GitHub Copilot coding agent and GitHub Spark. These updates provide teams with flexible options to control and oversee AI-related expenses as their development workflows grow.

## Key Features

- **Premium Request SKUs:** Dedicated SKUs for each AI tool (Copilot coding agent, GitHub Spark) allow precise attribution of AI usage and costs.
- **Budget Options:**
  - **Product-specific budgets:** Set individual spending limits for each AI tool at the SKU level.
  - **Bundled budget:** Manage all premium request SKUs under a unified budget for simplified oversight.
- **Enhanced Policy Controls:** Enterprise and Team administrators can now enable or disable budget overages on a per-tool basis directly within their Copilot policies.
- **Automatic Migration:** Existing premium request budgets will be seamlessly moved to the new system, preserving prior configurations without disruption.

## Impact and Benefits

- **Granular Visibility:** Clearly see which AI tools are driving usage and costs.
- **Spending Control:** Prevent budget overruns and enable AI adoption at a pace that fits your organization's needs.
- **Future-Ready Governance:** As GitHub's AI ecosystem expands and new tools emerge, bundled budgets automatically include them, supporting continued growth with predictable costs.

## Important Notes

- **Historical Usage:** Prior charges for Spark and coding agent will remain under the Copilot Premium Requests SKU, while new usage moving forward will have dedicated attribution.
- **Policy Scope:** Premium request overage controls apply only to Business and Enterprise accounts; Pro and Pro+ users maintain standard {{CONTENT}} budgets.
- **Upcoming Changes:** {{CONTENT}} premium request budgets for Enterprise and Team plans will be removed on November 18th.
