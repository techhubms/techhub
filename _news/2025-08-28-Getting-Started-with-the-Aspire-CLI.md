Jeffrey Fritz presents an in-depth walkthrough of the Aspire CLI, illustrating its use for .NET application development—from installation to running, integrating Azure services, and publishing distributed systems.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Getting Started with the Aspire CLI

The Aspire CLI is a powerful, cross-platform tool designed to streamline the development, management, and deployment of .NET application systems. It's suitable for building anything from simple websites to enterprise-scale distributed applications leveraging microservices, queues, and databases.

## 1. Installing the Aspire CLI

Before you start, ensure you have the [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0) installed.

### a. Installation as a Native Executable

- **Windows**: Run in PowerShell

  ```powershell
  Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod https://aspire.dev/install.ps1) }"
  ```

  Installs Aspire CLI to `%USERPROFILE%\.aspire\bin` (custom paths and versions are optional).

- **Unix (Linux/macOS)**: Run in terminal

  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash
  ```

  Installs to `$HOME/.aspire/bin` by default.

For custom options and troubleshooting, consult the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/cli/install?tabs=windows).

### b. Installation as a .NET Global Tool

This works cross-platform. Run:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Aspire.Cli --prerelease
```

Verify installation:

```bash
aspire --version
```

If you see a version number, installation succeeded.

## 2. Creating a New Project with Templates

To create a new project, run:

```powershell
aspire new
```

This launches an interactive setup to select templates, name your project, and specify an output folder.

**Available Templates:**

- **Starter** – Multi-project system demonstrating basics
- **AppHost & service defaults** – Orchestrated solution with defaults for distributed apps
- **AppHost** – Entry-point orchestrator only
- **Service defaults** – Projects with recommended .NET practices for microservices/websites
- **Integration tests** – Foundation for distributed application integration testing

The CLI fetches the latest templates and generates the solution structure.

## 3. Adding Integrations and Packages

To add official integration packages (e.g., databases, messaging), use:

```powershell
aspire add
```

You can provide a package/NuGet ID directly or browse the interactive list. Example integrations:

- Azure CosmosDB
- Azure Event Hubs
- Azure Functions
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure PostgreSQL
- Azure Redis
- Azure Service Bus
- Azure SignalR

This workflow simplifies dependency management directly from your terminal.

## 4. Running and Debugging Your Application

To launch in development mode, use:

```powershell
aspire run
```

This command:

- Sets up Aspire environment
- Builds/starts all AppHost resources
- Launches the Aspire dashboard (view logs, metrics, diagrams)
- Displays endpoint info

Example output:

```
Dashboard: https://localhost:17178/login?t=...
Logs: .../.aspire/cli/logs/apphost-...log
```

Logs persist to disk for review.

## 5. Publishing Your Application

The publishing feature is in preview. Use:

```powershell
aspire publish
```

This serializes resources for deployment—generating assets for Azure, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes depending on integrations.

A **deploy** command exists but is not yet functional.

## Conclusion

The Aspire CLI is designed as a one-stop workflow tool for .NET application professionals, providing streamlined processes from project creation to deployment. Source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/tree/main/src/Aspire.Cli).

Install Aspire CLI today to facilitate your next .NET distributed application project.
