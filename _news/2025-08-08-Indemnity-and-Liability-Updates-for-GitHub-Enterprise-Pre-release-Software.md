# Indemnity and Liability Updates for GitHub Enterprise Pre-release Software

GitHub has revised its Pre-release License Terms, simplifying the process for enterprise customers to trial preview features, effective July 9, 2025. The new terms now provide indemnity for volume licensing customers using pre-release GitHub software and its outputs, removing the previous "no indemnity" language and eliminating the standard liability cap concerning these protections.

## Key Updates

- **Indemnity Now Included:** Volume licensing customers receive indemnity protections when using pre-release software and its outputs.
- **No More Blanket Exclusion:** The "no indemnity" clause has been removed from pre-release terms.
- **Liability Cap Removed:** The typical liability cap does not apply to these new indemnity protections.

## Who's Covered?

Organizations under a GitHub Customer Agreement or Microsoft volume licensing agreement are eligible for these updates. Individual users or those on other plans remain unaffected.

**Effective Date:** July 9, 2025
