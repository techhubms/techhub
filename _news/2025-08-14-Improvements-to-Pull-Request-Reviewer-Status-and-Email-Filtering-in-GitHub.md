Allison outlines GitHub's latest updates: improved accessibility for pull request reviewer status and new email headers for smarter notification filtering, delivering a workflow boost for team collaboration.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Improvements to Pull Request Reviewer Status and Email Filtering in GitHub

GitHub has released two new features aimed at making it easier for users to manage pull requests and stay engaged with key conversations within their projects. These changes focus on improved clarity in the code review process and more customizable email notifications.

## Clearer Distinctions for Pull Request Reviewer Status

To enhance accessibility for all users, GitHub has made the reviewer status in pull requests more readable and less reliant on color. The updates include:

- **Top-of-sidebar grouping**: Reviewers whose approval impacts merge requirements, along with GitHub Copilot, are now prominently listed at the top of the “Reviewers” section. This includes pending reviews and requested changes.
- **Collapsible group for other reviewers**: Reviewers whose approval doesn't impact the merge requirements are grouped in a collapsible section labeled "+X more reviewers." This tidies up the sidebar and adds clarity on review roles.
- **Hover tooltips for clarity**: Extra context about these reviewers is provided via tooltips on hover.
- **Inclusive visual cues**: Descriptive labels and visual signals now comply with accessibility best practices. The status of each reviewer is easily discernible regardless of color perception.

These changes aim to streamline the code review workflow, helping teams quickly understand review status and merge readiness.

## Enhanced Email Notification Headers for Better Filtering

Organizing notifications is critical in fast-moving projects. GitHub’s new email notification headers allow for more effective filtering and categorization, so users don’t miss important updates. The update includes:

- **New email headers introduced**:
  - `X-Github-Labels`: Captures the labels set on issues or PRs
  - `X-Github-Assignees`: Lists assignees
  - `X-Github-Milestone`: Shows the milestone (if any)
  - `X-Github-Issuetype`: Indicates whether the notification is from an issue or pull request
- **Improved organization**: With this metadata in the headers, users can set up rules in their email clients (like filtering by specific labels or assignees) for quicker triage and less inbox clutter.

If any fields are missing from an issue or PR, their corresponding email header will appear empty or not be included.

## Community Feedback

GitHub continues to encourage feedback on these improvements:

- For reviewer status changes, join the conversation in their [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169699).
