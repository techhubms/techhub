# Automating .NET Development with GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

**Author: Bruno Capuano**

The GitHub Copilot Coding Agent is changing the way .NET developers approach day-to-day software development. Instead of just providing inline code completions, the Coding Agent can analyze your repository, plan complex multi-step tasks, create issues, open pull requests, and coordinate changesâ€”all in the cloud. This means developers get to focus more on design and code review, with Copilot handling repetitive, manual work.

## Key Scenarios Demonstrated

### 1. Automating Unit Test Creation

#### Analyze and Propose Unit Tests

- Copilot Coding Agent reviews the project (eShopLite sample) to identify gaps in test coverage.
- Using a structured prompt, Copilot suggests tests with details such as titles, descriptions, rationale, affected files, and test methods.

#### Review and Create Issues

- Developers review Copilot's structured unit test suggestions to ensure alignment with requirements.
- Copilot creates a GitHub issue containing the full list of proposed tests, tracking the work to be done ([Example issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/eShopLite/issues/47)).

#### Assign and Automate Test Implementation

- The issue is assigned to Copilot Coding Agent, which generates the test code and submits a pull request for human review ([Example PR](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/eShopLite/pull/48)).
- This process helps standardize and automate the entire unit test workflow.

### 2. Implementing Features from a PRD

#### Generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

- Developers prompt Copilot to draft a PRD for a new feature, in this case, a mock payment server.
- The PRD includes purpose, scope, key success criteria, API contracts, data models, testing strategy, and more.

#### Automatic Feature Implementation

- Once the PRD is approved, Copilot Coding Agent proceeds to implement the feature:
    - Generates code changes and configuration updates
    - Creates or updates UI as needed
    - Utilizes tools like Playwright for validation and screenshots
    - Opens pull requests for review ([Example PR](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/eShopLite/pull/49))

## Integrations and Best Practices

- The Copilot Coding Agent seamlessly integrates with GitHub workflows and supports advanced customization using `AGENTS.md` instructions ([Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-28-copilot-coding-agent-now-supports-agents-md-custom-instructions)).
- To maximize effectiveness and maintain project standards, developers should always review Copilot-generated code before merging.

## Benefits for .NET Developers

- **Boosted Productivity:** Automates low-level coding and project setup tasks.
- **Quality and Consistency:** Encourages thorough test coverage and standardized implementation based on requirements.
- **Focus on Higher-Value Work:** Developers spend more time architecting and less time on repetitive activities.

## Cautions

- While Copilot can automate much of the development process, its outputs should always be subject to human oversight for quality, security, and relevance.
