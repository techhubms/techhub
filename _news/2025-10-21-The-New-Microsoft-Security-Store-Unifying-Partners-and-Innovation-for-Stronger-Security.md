# The New Microsoft Security Store: Uniting Partners and Innovation

by Dorothy Li

## Overview

The Microsoft Security Store, introduced in public preview on September 30, 2025, is a unified marketplace for discovering, buying, and deploying security solutions and AI-powered agents from Microsoft and its partners. The store aims to help organizations defend against sophisticated cyberthreats and streamline security operations.

## Key Features

- **Curated Ecosystem**: The store connects customers with trusted security SaaS solutions and AI agents, all verified by Microsoft to be compatible with its security products.
- **Integration with Microsoft Security Products**: Solutions are discoverable by products such as Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Entra, and Microsoft Purview, as well as by security functions—threat protection, identity management, compliance, cloud security, and more.
- **AI-Powered Agents**: The Security Store features AI automation, including agents built on Microsoft Security Copilot, supporting functions like automated triage, investigation acceleration, and real-time insights.
- **Framework-Based Organization**: Offerings are organized by industry standards such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, making it easy to filter by security function.

## Benefits for Customers

- **Unified Experience**: Simplifies the process of finding, evaluating, and deploying security solutions within the Microsoft ecosystem.
- **Streamlined Deployment**: Customers deploy solutions and agents directly from the Security Store, with guided processes and automatic resource provisioning.
- **Azure Integration**: Purchases use existing Microsoft accounts, with consolidated billing. Eligible purchases can contribute to Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC).
- **Wide Range of Solutions**: Includes offerings for threat protection, incident response, identity and access management, data security, privacy, compliance, endpoint and cloud security, and real-time AI automation.

## Benefits for Partners

- **Global Commerce Infrastructure**: Enables partners to transact in local currencies with built-in billing and entitlement management.
- **Access to New Customers**: In-app discovery and integration with Microsoft's go-to-market mechanisms increase exposure.
- **Monetization**: Partners can sell both SaaS solutions and AI agents. The store is positioned as a central platform for security innovation.

## Example Solutions and Agents
