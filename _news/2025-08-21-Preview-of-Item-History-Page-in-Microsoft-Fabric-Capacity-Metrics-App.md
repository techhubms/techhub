Microsoft Fabric Blog announces a new Item History page in the Fabric Capacity Metrics App, offering detailed 30-day compute usage analytics for capacity management and optimization.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Preview of Item History Page in Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics App

The Microsoft Fabric Blog introduces the Preview version of the Item History page within the Microsoft Fabric Capacity Metrics App. This page is designed to deliver a thorough 30-day analysis of compute usage, using interactive visuals and slicers to empower capacity administrators and data professionals.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Slicers:** Filter data by capacity name, workspace, experience, operation, run by, and billing type.
- **Aggregate Compute Consumption:** Analyze overall compute consumption and pinpoint high-usage items.
- **CU(s) by Workspace/Item:** Identify which workspaces and items are driving the highest capacity unit (CU) consumption.
- **Smoothed CU % Over Time:** Visualize background vs. interactive operation consumption, including overload alerts with a CU % limit line.
- **Workspace Details:** See metrics like operations pass rate, operation count, and compute percentage consumed.
- **Item History:** Drill down to item-level usage across dates, including compute consumed, status, and possible throttling time.
- **Scheduling Frequency & Status Breakdown:** Explore operation frequency and status percentages.
- **CU(s) by Date:** Graph capacity unit consumption trends across time.
- **Detailed Item Metrics:** Access information such as date scheduled, % compute used, completion status, and seconds throttled.

These insights enable users to pinpoint workload bottlenecks, optimize resource utilization, and plan for capacity upgrades.

## Use Cases

- **Capacity Planning:** Identify consistent high-consumption items, forecasting future needs.
- **Usage Trends:** Understand the long-term impact of workspaces/items on capacity utilization.

The inclusion of the Item History page represents a commitment to transparent, actionable capacity monitoring and resource optimization.

For deployment and further information, see the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/metrics-app-item-history-page) and install or update the [Fabric Capacity Metrics App](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/power-bi/pbi_pcmm.microsoftpremiumfabricpreviewreport).
