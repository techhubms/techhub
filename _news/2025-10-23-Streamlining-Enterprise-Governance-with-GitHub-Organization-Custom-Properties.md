# Streamlining Enterprise Governance with GitHub Organization Custom Properties

Organization custom properties in GitHub, now available in public preview, enable enterprise administrators to assign and manage metadata across organizations for more precise ruleset targeting.

## What Are Organization Custom Properties?

This enables the creation of targeted policies tailored to various business needs.

- **Single-select:** Choose one value from a predefined list.

- **Text:** Input free-form text.
- **True/false:** Set a boolean value.

**Configuration limits:**

- Up to 100 property definitions per enterprise.
- Allowed value lists can include up to 200 items.
- Property names: Only `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`, `-`, `---
