# Virtual Network Data Gateway Now Generally Available for Fabric Pipeline, Dataflow Gen2, and Copy Job

The Microsoft Fabric Blog details the launch of Virtual Network (VNET) Data Gateway support for Fabric Pipeline, Dataflow Gen2 Fast Copy, and Copy Job, all now generally available for enterprise use.

## Why This Matters

Organizations handling sensitive or regulated data must ensure their information moves securely between private networks and Microsoft Fabric. The VNET Data Gateway enables:

- **Private Data Transfers:** Data doesn't traverse public networks.
- **Faster Connections:** Leverage private endpoints and ExpressRoute for high-speed, low-latency connectivity.
- **Centralized Management:** Administer secure data integration from a single gateway for simplified operations.

## General Availability Highlights

1. **Fabric Pipeline Copy with VNET Gateway**  
   Securely copy data from private or network-isolated sources to Fabric without exposing public endpoints.
2. **Fast Copy in Dataflow Gen2**  
   Enhance data ingestion speed while adhering to enterprise security and compliance requirements.
3. **Copy Job Support**  
   Schedule secure data movement jobs with minimal setup and unified governance across all workloads.
