# Effortless Extension Migration in Visual Studio 2026: Modern Compatibility Model for Developers

**Author: Tina Schrepfer**

Visual Studio 2026 introduces a significant improvement for extension users and developers: a new compatibility model designed to ensure that most extensions continue working seamlessly across major Visual Studio releases, removing much of the hassle previously involved in migration and updates.

## Key Points for Extension Users

- **Automatic Compatibility**: Extensions that work in Visual Studio 2022 will automatically work in Visual Studio 2026. No manual intervention is required for most extensions.
- **Smooth Upgrades**: The Visual Studio Installer will carry over most of your existing 2022 extensions when upgrading to 2026.

## Key Points for Extension Developers

- **No More Frequent Updates**: Developers no longer need to update version ranges or handle major compatibility headaches every release.
- **API-Centric Model**: Extensions now specify which API versions they target instead of which Visual Studio versions, allowing smoother future compatibility.
- **Lower Bound Only**: Visual Studio now uses only the lower bound of the installation target version range for compatibility checks, streamlining the upgrade process. For example:
  - Existing: `<InstallationTarget Id="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community" Version="[17.0, 18.0)">`
  - New: `<InstallationTarget Id="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community" Version="[17.0,)">`
- **VSIX Recommended**: The migration improvements apply to VSIX-based extensions. MSI-based extension authors are advised to move to VSIX installers.

## Model Principles

1. **API Version Declaration**: Extensions indicate the API version they are built against.
2. **Stability Commitment**: The Visual Studio platform will minimize or eliminate breaking changes to stable APIs.
3. **Additive API Rollout**: New APIs will be introduced in a preview phase before becoming stable.

## Developer Guidance and Best Practices

- **Test on VS 2026**: While backward compatibility is strong, testing on the new version is still recommended to catch possible platform-specific issues.
- **Report Problems**: Use the [Report a Problem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio?view=visualstudio) tool for issues likely caused by the platform.
- **Stay Informed**: Follow updates on new APIs, improvements in build tooling, and extension acquisition capabilities.
- **Feedback Channels**: Engage with the Visual Studio team and the broader developer community via:
  - [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/home)
  - [GitHub repo for issues](https://github.com/microsoft/VSExtensibility/issues)
  - [Partner feedback survey](https://aka.ms/vs-extension-authors)
  - [Documentation](https://aka.ms/VisualStudio.Extensibility)
  - [Video series on Visual Studio Toolbox](https://aka.ms/vsextensibilityseries)

## Looking Ahead

- **Additive APIs**: Upcoming features will introduce new APIs released first as preview packages. Extensions using preview APIs can't be uploaded to the Marketplace due to possible breaking changes.
- **Collaborative Evolution**: Developers are invited to contribute feedback, suggestions, and report issues to help shape the extension ecosystem.

## Additional Resources and Community

- Stay current by following Visual Studio on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@visualstudio), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VisualStudio), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/microsoft-visual-studio/), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/visualstudio), and [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/?view=vs-2022).
- Join ecosystem partner calls or fill out the [engagement survey](https://aka.ms/vs-extension-authors) to participate directly.
