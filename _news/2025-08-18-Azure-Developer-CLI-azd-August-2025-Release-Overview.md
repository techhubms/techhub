# Azure Developer CLI (azd) August 2025 Release Overview

Author: PuiChee (PC) Chan

## Release Highlights

The August 2025 edition of Azure Developer CLI (azd) introduces releases 1.18.1 and 1.18.2. This update focuses on bug fixes, improved documentation, and new community-driven deployment templates.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

- **PowerShell fallback support:** The azd hook engine now automatically falls back to Windows PowerShell 5.1 if PowerShell 7 is unavailable, ensuring event hook scripts operate across more environments. Scripts relying on PowerShell 7 features may still fail in 5.1.
- **Aspire project detection:** azd checks for .NET Aspire projects before running, preventing errors.
- **Enhanced Visual Studio deployment:** Nonproject.v0 items are skipped, so only valid services are published.
- **Improved error handling:** Clear suggestions now shown when resource group or Container App errors occur during deployment.
- **CI/CD automation:** Interactive login prompts are now avoided in CI/CD environments, improving automation workflows.
- **Credential management:** Invalid branch name characters are fixed for federated credential name generation.
- **Package deployment stability:** Packages remain protected when using the `--from-package` flag with `azd deploy`.
- **Linux support:** Extension installation issues have been resolved for Linux systems.
- **Containerd/Docker error messaging:** More helpful error messages for containerd-enabled Docker package failures.
- **Aspire project warnings:** Warnings now display if a legacy or limited .NET Aspire project is detected.

### Updated Documentation

- _Azure Developer CLI environment overview_: Detailed guide to environment variables, their usage, and troubleshooting.
- _Working with environments_: Guidance for creating, managing, and switching azd environments.
- _Resource Group Scoped Deployments_: Steps to enable scoped deployments for resource groups.
- _Managing environment variables_: Expanded insights on handling environment variables for multi-environment workflows.
- _Reference documents_: CLI reference improvements, with current environment and variable management commands.
- “Dev to Production” series: See how azd workflows can be implemented with Azure DevOps and Azure Pipelines.

### New Templates from the Community

- **Trainer-Demo-Deploy scenarios**: Rapid prototyping and demo templates.
- **Azure Monitor with custom logs**: Deploy Log Analytics workspaces with custom log tables and external telemetry collection.
- **API Management + ConferenceAPI (OAuth2, Entra ID)**: Secure API deployment integrating ConferenceAPI with OAuth2 and Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Microsoft Sentinel threat detection and response**: Demo template aligned with AZ-500 and AZ-104 certification paths.
- **Azure PostgreSQL & AI integration**: Step-by-step guidance for connecting, configuring, and integrating AI with PostgreSQL in Azure.
- **Purview templates for secure AI prompts**: Purview API integration in TypeScript and Python for auditing and securing AI prompts/responses:
  - Serverless AI chat with LangChain.js and Purview.
  - RAG chat app with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search.
