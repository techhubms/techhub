# Automating Secure and Scalable AI Deployments on Azure with HashiCorp

*By cindywang, davidwright*

While AI continues to propel innovation, organizations frequently struggle to move AI initiatives beyond prototyping into stable production environments. Industry research reflects these growing pains: Gartner reports only 30% of AI projects reach production, and according to RAND, up to 80% fail to meet expectations. The core issue isn't model quality, but rather the readiness and reliability of the deployment platform.

## The Shift: From Running AI in the Cloud to Building the Cloud for AI

Successfully delivering AI at scale demands more than traditional cloud infrastructure. Organizations must create consistent, secure, and governed platforms to manage the operational complexities unique to data-intensive and agentic AI workloads, including:

- Provisioning infrastructure for diverse teams and environments.
- Ensuring secure, governed access to sensitive models, data, and pipelines.
- Managing permissions and execution boundaries, particularly for agent-based systems.
- Meeting rigorous enterprise security, compliance, and audit standards.

AI workloads differ from typical applications due to their reliance on interconnected services, APIs, users, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, all of which expand the attack surface with each integration. Proactive platform engineering—embedding security and scalability into the infrastructure delivery pipeline—is essential.

## HashiCorp + Azure: Automate the AI Infrastructure Lifecycle

**HashiCorp** tools paired with Azure services enable platform teams to automate and secure AI environments, using methods and tools such as:

### 1. Provisioning with Terraform and Azure Verified Modules

- Define infrastructure as code (IaC) using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform)
- Deploy compute, networking, and storage as Azure resources using [Azure Verified Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=azurerm) that align with Microsoft standards
- Achieve consistent, production-grade, and compliant environments leveraging built-in best practices

### 2. Access Security with Vault

- Centrally manage credentials, secrets, and sensitive data via [Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault)
- Utilize dynamic secrets, identity-based access, and control groups (incorporating human-in-the-loop approvals)
- Mitigate risks for LLMs, data pipelines, and prompt injection with robust access controls

### 3. Self-Service Enablement with HCP Terraform

- Leverage [HCP Terraform](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in) for remote state management and policy as code (Sentinel integration)
- Incorporate infrastructure changes into CI/CD workflows
- Expose secure, reusable infrastructure environments to AI and ML teams, retaining central control and visibility

## Scaling AI Safely: Guardrails for Agentic Workloads

Modern AI architectures, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), orchestration agents, and tool-using LLMs, create novel operational and security risks, including:

- Unbounded API or data access
- Vulnerability to prompt injection attacks and potential data exfiltration
- Escalation of permissions through chained or agent-based systems

With HashiCorp and Azure, platform engineers can automate the enforcement of security guardrails:

- Apply least-privilege policies and short-lived credentials using Vault
- Enforce compliance requirements and infrastructure configuration policies at plan time with Sentinel
- Establish secure patterns for AI deployment using standardized modules and registries

## Building a Trusted AI Platform

The reliability and impact of AI initiatives are only as strong as the underlying infrastructure foundation. By automating the provisioning process, enforcing access security, and integrating policy at all stages, platform teams enable data science and AI professionals to focus on innovation—without sacrificing security, scalability, or compliance.
