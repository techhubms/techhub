# GitHub Copilot CLI Extension Deprecation Announcement

The GitHub team has announced that the [gh-copilot](https://github.com/github/gh-copilot) extension for GitHub CLI will stop working on **October 25, 2025**. Users are advised to prepare for this transition.

## Key Changes

- The `gh-copilot` CLI extension will be deprecated and will cease to function after the announced date.
- Enterprise customers with the "Copilot in the CLI" policy enabled will see this policy automatically disabled, allowing administrators to review and potentially enable the new Copilot CLI.
- The new [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli) delivers a more advanced, agentic AI coding assistant experience locally in the terminal, far surpassing the legacy extension's features.

## Migration Path & Alternatives

- **Copilot Pro and Enterprise users:** Migrate to the new Copilot CLI for improved capabilities and continued AI-powered assistance at the command line.
- **Free plan users:** The new Copilot CLI is not currently available. Instead:
  - Use "Ask mode" in Visual Studio Code for explanations and command suggestions.
  - Explore the [gh-models](https://github.com/github/gh-models) CLI extension to interact with AI models in the CLI environment.

## Additional Resources

- [GitHub Copilot CLI Repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)
- [gh-models Extension](https://github.com/github/gh-models)

Stay informed to ensure a smooth migration before October 25, 2025. If you manage enterprise environments, review your current policies and adapt to leverage the new Copilot CLIâ€™s features.
