# Plan Mode in GitHub Copilot Now Available in Public Preview for JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode

GitHub Copilot introduces **plan mode** in public preview for popular IDEs: JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode. This new feature gives developers a stepwise blueprint for their coding tasks, helping plan, validate, and execute projects with more structure and oversight.

## What is Plan Mode?

Plan mode lets you:

- Generate a detailed execution plan for high-level development tasks (e.g., add features, refactor, or fix bugs)
- Review a step breakdown before any code changes are made
- Hand off plans for implementation to Copilot agents or use them yourself
- Increase coding accuracy and efficiency through clear, actionable roadmaps

No modifications are made to your code until you approve and trigger the implementation.

## How to Use Plan Mode

### In JetBrains IDEs

1. Sign in and open Copilot Chat.
2. Choose Plan mode from the agents dropdown.
3. Describe your high-level task (e.g., “Create a simple to-do app with HTML, CSS, and JS files.”).
4. Review Copilot’s plan, then select **Start Implementation** or **Open in Editor**.

### In Eclipse

1. Sign into the Copilot Chat panel and select Plan mode.
2. Enter your task description (e.g., “Create a to-do app with a GUI and functionalities to add, delete, and update to-do items.”).
3. Review the plan and proceed as needed.

### In Xcode

1. Open GitHub Copilot for Xcode and sign in.
2. Select Plan mode from the agents dropdown.
3. Describe your coding task (e.g., “Build a minesweeper game with GUI.”).
4. Review and approve before starting implementation.

## Availability

Plan mode is now in **public preview** on all major IDEs:

- [JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot)
- [Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/github-copilot)
- [Xcode](https://github.com/github/copilotforXcode/)

To access, update your Copilot plugin/app and ensure you have a valid [Copilot license](https://github.com/features/copilot).
