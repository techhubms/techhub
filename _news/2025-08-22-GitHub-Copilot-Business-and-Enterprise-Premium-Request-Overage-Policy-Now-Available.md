# Premium Request Overage Policy for GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise

GitHub has introduced a premium request overage policy specifically for Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise customers. This new policy aims to simplify management and provide greater control over premium Copilot feature usage in your organization.

## What’s Changing

- **Dedicated Overage Policy:** Organizations can now configure how to handle premium requests that exceed their included usage. The policy settings are:
  - **Enabled (default):** Allows additional premium request usage beyond quota, incurring charges as overages.
  - **Disabled:** Blocks Copilot usage when included premium requests are exhausted, preventing extra charges.
- **Customization:** Any existing {{CONTENT}} premium request budgets will remain unchanged, but admins can modify or remove these budgets as needed.

## What’s Not Changing

- **Individual Plans Unaffected:** Copilot for individuals (Pro/Pro+) is not impacted.
- **Current Budgets:** Existing premium request budgets, included requests, and seat pricing are preserved.
