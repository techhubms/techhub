# Better Control Over GitHub Copilot Code Suggestions in Visual Studio

GitHub Copilot continues to evolve as an AI-powered coding assistant, now offering developers more precise control over when and how code suggestions appear in Visual Studio 2022.

## Enhanced Control Features

Developers often find code suggestions helpful but sometimes intrusive. Responding to community feedback, Visual Studio now offers several features to improve the coding experience:

### 1. Minimize Distractions While Coding

- **Pause Completions When Typing:** A new debounce option delays Copilot suggestions until you pause typing, reducing interruptions.
- **Access:** Go to `Tools -> Options -> IntelliCode -> Advanced` and enable *wait for pauses in typing before showing whole line completions*.

### 2. Manual Trigger for Code Completions

- **Disable Automatic Suggestions:** Turn off automatic completions and trigger them only via keyboard shortcuts (`Alt + ,` or `Alt + .`).
- **Configuration:** Navigate to `Tools > Options > IntelliCode > General` and uncheck *Automatically generate code completions in the Editor*.
- **Experience:** A hint bar appears while Copilot generates suggestions; use Tab to accept available completions.

### 3. Manage Next Edit Suggestions (NES)

- **Hide and Reveal NES:** Next Edit Suggestions (NES) can now remain hidden by default until you’re ready to review.
- **Indicator:** A margin symbol in the editor gutter alerts you when NES are available. Click the indicator or press Tab to view, then Tab or ESC to accept or dismiss, respectively.
- **Further configuration:** Visit `Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Completions` and check *Collapse Next Edit Suggestions*.

### 4. Partial Acceptance of Code Completions

- **Word-by-Word and Line-by-Line:** Accept Copilot suggestions incrementally:
  - `Ctrl + Right Arrow` for word-by-word acceptance.
  - `Ctrl + Down Arrow` for line-by-line acceptance.
- **Margin Options:** Margin indicators allow partial acceptance via UI as well.
- **Disabling:** To revert, go to `Tools > Options > IntelliCode > Advanced -> Whole-line completions`.

### 5. Community Feedback

This release implements features requested by developers in the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-completions-are-too-intrusive/10810929#T-ND10921637) and through surveys, aiming to ensure a comfortable and powerful Copilot experience.
