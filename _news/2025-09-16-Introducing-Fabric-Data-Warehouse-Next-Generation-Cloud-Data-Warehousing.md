# Introducing Fabric Data Warehouse: Next-Generation Cloud Data Warehousing

Fabric Data Warehouse is a recent addition to Microsoft's data platform ecosystem, developed from the ground up for the 2020s with a next-generation, lakehouse-based architecture. This news post details key innovations, enterprise-focused features, developer tooling, and migration aids, backed by real customer outcomes announced at FabCon Europe.

## Architectural Overview and Performance

- **Lakehouse Architecture:** Fully serverless, scales to hundreds of petabytes, and tightly integrated with the broader Fabric data platform.
- **Performance Gains:** 40+ performance improvements delivered in early 2025 yielded a 36% improvement in standard benchmarks. For example, Willis Tower Watson reduced a query from 64 hours for 80 TB on Azure Synapse to 29 hours for over 400 TB on Fabricâ€”processing more data in less time.
- **Continuous Enhancements:** Upcoming features include incremental/proactive stats refresh and clustering for further optimization.

## Enterprise-Grade Features

- **Resiliency:** Automatic failover across zones and node-level query resiliency.
- **Security and Compliance:** Support for [PrivateLink](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/fabric-workspace-level-private-link-preview/), customer-managed encryption keys, outbound network controls, and streamlined audit log analysis.
- **Flexible Data Types:** Native support for `varchar(max)` and `varbinary(max)` for large data values.
- **Advanced SQL:** `MERGE` operations (combined insert, update, delete), `OPENROWSET(JSONL)` for querying JSON directly in OneLake/ADLS, and soon, identity columns.
- **Collation:** [Workspace-level collation settings](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/streamlining-data-management-with-collation-settings-in-microsoft-fabric-warehouse-sql-analytics-endpoint//) enable configuration for case sensitivity.

## Developer and Migration Tooling

- **Data Agent and Data-driven alerts:** Trigger actions based on query results.
- **Integration with SSMS:** Familiar tooling for database professionals.
- **[dbt Connector](https://github.com/Microsoft/dbt-fabric):** Enhanced support for analytics engineers.
- **Copilot for SQL:** Integrated assistant for SQL optimization, documentation lookup, chat-based assistance, and improved SQL generation.
- **Warehouse Migration Assistant:** AI-powered, self-service migration tool with seamless transition from Azure Synapse and dedicated pools, as shared by Kantar (reduced costs by 50% and quadrupled environments).

## Getting Started

- **Join the Community:** Over 20,000 warehouse customers and hundreds of thousands of developers and data professionals are embracing Fabric Data Warehouse.
- **Try for Free:** [Start with two months free](https://aka.ms/tryfabric) (no credit card required).
- **Product Roadmap:** Review the [public roadmap](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-the-fabric-roadmap?ft=All) and contribute ideas via the [Ideas Portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/categories/list/?category=556c6fe0-a302-e711-8106-5065f38a3bb1&amp;forum=515617a5-dedb-e911-a814-000d3a4f1244).

## Customer Success Highlights

- Willis Tower Watson: Achieved 47% performance improvement processing 5x more data compared to equivalent Synapse workloads.
- Kantar: Migrated seamlessly, quadrupled development environments, reduced costs by half, and leveraged familiar T-SQL capabilities.

## Key Takeaways for Practitioners

- Fabric Data Warehouse offers significant advancements for cloud-scale data warehousing, with a strong focus on both enterprise needs and development modernity.
- Security, management, and developer tooling are core priorities, supporting flexible integration and high productivity.
- Migration tools and compatibility features lower adoption friction for organizations moving from Azure Synapse or other enterprise data warehouse products.
