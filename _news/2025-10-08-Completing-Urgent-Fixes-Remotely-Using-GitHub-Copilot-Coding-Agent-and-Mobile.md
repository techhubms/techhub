# Completing Urgent Fixes Remotely Using GitHub Copilot Coding Agent and Mobile

**Author:** Scott Lusk

## Overview

Discover how to tackle software development emergencies from anywhere by combining the capabilities of GitHub Copilot coding agent with GitHub Mobile. Scott Lusk shares strategies, real-world workflows, and actionable best practices to maximize your efficiency with the GitHub platform.

## Real-World Scenario: Fixing a Bug On-the-Go

Scott recounts an incident where a critical website feature malfunctioned minutes before an important demo. Lacking access to a computer, he used only his phone and:

- Identified the problematic pull request via **GitHub Mobile**
- Created and detailed a new issue for the bug
- Delegated the fix to **GitHub Copilot coding agent** by referencing repository instructions
- Received a Copilot-generated pull request with a proposed fix within six minutes
- Reviewed and approved the solution on his phone, triggering deployment via GitHub Actions

This workflow enabled resolution before the demo began, showcasing the transformative potential of integrated toolsets.

## Key Practices to Unlock This Power-Up

### 1. Leverage Copilot Instructions Files

Custom instructions help Copilot understand the unique context of your repository:

- Place a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file at the root of your repo.
- Define key architecture details, coding conventions, dependency choices, and test strategies.
- Example topics: directory layout, framework usage (like Next.js App Router with TypeScript), preferred UI libraries (shadcn/ui), testing tools (Vitest), and deployment environments (Vercel, GitHub Actions).

**Sample Copilot Instructions Excerpt:**

```markdown
- Use Next.js App Router with React and TypeScript across the project.
- Prefer shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS v4 for UI development.
- Implement server actions in src/lib/actions and keep utilities organized.
- Write tests with Vitest for critical logic and components.
- Use pnpm for package management; automate CI with GitHub Actions.
```

See [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions) and [community-contributed samples](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) for further guidance.

### 2. Treat Copilot as a Team Member

Delegate well-defined, well-contextualized issues to Copilot:

- Clearly state the problem and relevant pull requests or files.
- Use repository instructions to provide Copilot with context, reducing the need for repetitive explanations.
- Review Copilot’s pull requests before merging, using `@copilot` mentions in comments for further iterations or changes if needed.

### 3. Automate with IssueOps and GitHub Actions

Maximize repeatability and control by integrating automation workflows:

- Use [IssueOps patterns](https://github.blog/engineering/issueops-automate-ci-cd-and-more-with-github-issues-and-actions/) to trigger GitHub Actions from structured issue comments or templates.
- Save time and gather necessary context using pre-defined issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`.
- Build robust CI/CD pipelines triggered by pull requests and automated issue triage.

**Sample Issue Template Excerpt:**

```yaml
name: "Bug (Copilot Coding Agent-ready)"
description: "Report a bug with details so Copilot can propose a fix via PR."
title: "[Bug]: <short summary>"
labels: ["bug", "triage", "copilot-coding-agent"]
body:
  - type: input
    id: environment
    attributes:
      label: Environment
      description: OS/Browser, device, app version/commit, and environment.
      validations:
        required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: steps
    attributes:
      label: Reproduction steps
      description: Provide a minimal, reliable sequence.
      validations:
        required: true
```

See [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests) for full setup details.
