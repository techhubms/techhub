Allison outlines new GitHub web UI features that simplify file editing and navigation, especially for open source contributors, focusing on branch workflows and improved UI feedback.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Improved File Navigation and Editing in the GitHub Web UI

GitHub has released a set of updates to enhance file navigation and editing in its web-based interface. These changes focus on reducing confusion around editing files from search results and navigating between branches, particularly benefiting new open source contributors.

## Seamless Editing from Search Results

- Previously, searching for a file on GitHub could be confusing: search results link to a specific commit, and editing was disabled unless on a branch.
- Now, if you’re on the latest commit of the default branch (HEAD), a dropdown next to the pencil icon lets you quickly switch to editing the file on the default branch.
- This streamlines the editing experience and clarifies branch requirements for making changes.
- The **Edit > In place** option is only shown if you’re already on a branch with edit permissions; both options never appear together.

## Easy Navigation to Default Branch

- GitHub introduced a **View on default branch** button near the branch picker in the file tree.
- Button behavior:
  1. Hidden if you’re already on the default branch.
  2. Disabled with a tooltip if the file doesn’t exist on the default branch.
  3. Enabled if navigation to the file on the default branch is possible.
- This comes in response to user feedback about the need for smoother branch navigation, particularly surfaced via the Refined GitHub project.

## Providing Feedback

GitHub encourages users to share feedback and report issues via their [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/172354).

These improvements are expected to provide a more seamless experience, especially for developers contributing to open source projects.
