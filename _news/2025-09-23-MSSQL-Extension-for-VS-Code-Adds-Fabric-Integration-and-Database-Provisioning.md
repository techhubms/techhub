# MSSQL Extension for VS Code: Fabric Integration (Preview)

## Overview

Version 1.36.0 of the [MSSQL Extension for VS Code](http://aka.ms/vscode-mssql) brings Microsoft Fabric functionality directly to developers' local workflows. This release introduces two major features: Fabric Connectivity (Browse) and SQL Database in Fabric Provisioning, both available in Public Preview. The additions are designed to facilitate easier database management and application prototyping without leaving the Visual Studio Code environment.

## Fabric Connectivity (Preview)

- **Direct Workspace Access:** Users can now browse and connect to Fabric workspaces within VS Code using a dedicated Fabric connection type in the connection dialog.
- **Seamless Authentication:** Authentication leverages Microsoft Entra ID, offering secure, persistent sign-in.
- **Intuitive Workspace Browsing:** Workspaces are displayed in a tree view, supporting on-demand resource loading and real-time search for efficient navigation.

## SQL Database in Fabric Provisioning (Preview)

- **Simple Provisioning Flow:** Developers can authenticate, select or create a workspace, and provision a SQL database within minutes, right from the Deployments page.
- **Immediate Connection:** Newly created databases are automatically added to your connections for instant use.
- **Consistent Experience:** Provisioning aligns with other backend options, like local SQL Server containers, and offers clear guidance when capacity isnâ€™t available.
