Allison details new features in GitHub repository ruleset management, introducing the exempt bypass type for trusted actors and improved accessibility in repository insights.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub Ruleset Exemptions and Repository Insights Updates

GitHub has introduced two important improvements for repository management:

## New Ruleset Bypass Type: Exemptions

- Repository rulesets now offer an `exempt` bypass type, allowing specific actors (users, teams, or GitHub Apps) to be excused from all enforced rules.
- Unlike the standard 'break glass' bypass, exemptions do not generate audit signals and operate silently, ideal for trusted automation or large-scale migration.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces friction for trusted, high-volume automation (including bots handling migrations or integrations).
  - Speeds up large repository migrations without disabling overall rules.
  - Enables behavior parity with classic branch protection's “Restrict who can push.”
- **How to Configure an Exemption:**
  1. Navigate to your repository's ruleset settings.
  2. In the “Bypass” list, locate the actor you want to exempt.
  3. Open the context menu (**…**).
  4. Select the **Exempt** option.
- This feature helps maintain security while optimizing workflow for automation and migration scenarios.

## Enhanced Repository Insights for Accessibility

- GitHub repository insights (traffic and pulse) now feature more accessible graphs for users relying on screen readers.
- Users can switch graphs to tabular view or download the data as CSV or PNG, aiding reporting and analysis workflows.
- **Temporary Note:** Referring sites and popular content data on traffic insights may be missing or inaccurate as of this update — GitHub is working on a fix.
