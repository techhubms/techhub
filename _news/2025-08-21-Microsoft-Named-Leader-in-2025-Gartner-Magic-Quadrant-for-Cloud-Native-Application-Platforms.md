# Microsoft Named Leader in 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud-Native Application Platforms

Microsoft is recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Cloud-Native Application Platforms, reflecting its continued innovation and commitment to developer experience and AI leadership.

## Key Highlights

- **Comprehensive Cloud-Native Platform:** Azure offers a unified platform for building web apps, APIs, event-driven applications, serverless functions, containers, and AI agents, serving enterprises and startups alike.
- **Developer Experience:** Azure’s platform enables productivity and choice across multiple runtimes (.NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, containers), with deep integrations into GitHub and DevOps pipelines, plus global reach.
- **Integrated Services:**
  - **Azure App Service:** Enterprise-grade PaaS for web apps, supporting major programming languages and frameworks.
  - **Azure Container Apps:** Serverless containers, supporting microservices and event-driven workloads. New features include serverless GPU support and integration with Azure AI Foundry.
  - **Azure Functions:** Event-driven serverless compute, now with Flex Consumption plans (.NET 8 support, enhanced scaling, durable workflows).
  - **Azure Static Web Apps:** Managed full-stack web application service for modern frameworks.
  - **Agentic DevOps:** Deep integration with GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio for seamless coding and deployment. Azure SRE Agent accelerates code-to-cloud workflows.

## Innovation in AI-Native Apps

- **Azure AI Foundry** unifies agents, models, and tools with enterprise-readiness (tracing, monitoring, evaluations), hosting popular models like GPT-5, GPT-4o, Llama, Phi-4, and more.
- **AI Integration:**
  - Serverless GPUs in Azure Container Apps enable scalable, cost-effective AI model inference.
  - Dynamic sessions provide secure, on-demand environments for LLM and agentic workloads.
  - Azure App Service introduces SLM sidecar integration for language model hosting and scaling.
- **Real-World AI Success:**
  - **Coca-Cola:** Built scalable, multilingual conversational AI using Azure AI Foundry and application services.
  - **Medigold Health:** Automated reports and improved clinician retention using Azure App Service, OpenAI Service, Cosmos DB, and SQL Database.
  - **NFL:** Enhanced Combine App with real-time AI assistant leveraging Azure OpenAI, Container Apps, and Cosmos DB.
  - **Audi AG:** Deployed secure, scalable HR AI assistants using Azure AI Foundry and core app services.

## Operational and Cost Improvements

- **App Service Premium v4 (preview):** Improved performance and cost savings versus previous generations.
- **Azure Functions Flex Consumption:** Advanced scaling, better concurrency, no cold starts, virtual network integration.
- **Availability Zones:** Multi-instance App Service plans now have expanded zone redundancy and simplified setup.
