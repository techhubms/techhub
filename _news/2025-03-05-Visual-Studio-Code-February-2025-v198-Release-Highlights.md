## Detailed Release Breakdown

### 1. GitHub Copilot & Agent Mode

**Agent Mode** allows Copilot to take over more complex developer workflows:

- Finds context in the workspace, edits code, checks for errors, and runs commands.
- Allows stepwise control: you can approve, edit, or undo actions inline.
- Includes notebook file support and now lifts interaction/file limits.
- Additional AI models (such as GPT-4.5 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) are available, and custom instructions allow deeper personalization.

### 2. Editor and UI Improvements

- **Terminal IntelliSense** supplies more accurate CLI auto-complete for common shells and CLIs, including dynamic completion generators (e.g., `git branch`).
- **Drag & Drop for Peek References:** Quickly navigate code structure.
- **Inline notebook diff view:** Inline and side-by-side comparisons for notebook content.
- **Accessibility:** Copilot Edits provide audio cues and accessible diffs.
- **Custom Title Bar (Linux):** Now default, but configurable.

### 3. Language & Extension Updates

- **TypeScript:** Updated to 5.8.2 with improved type checking and support for Node options.
- **Python (Pylance):** Better memory use, instant shell integration, more flexible test discovery, and debug config.
- **Remote Development:** EOL for Linux legacy server; improved support for proxy scenarios.
- **Debug:** Rich inline value hovers for debugging.

### 4. Source Control & DevOps

- **Soft Delete:** Untracked changes go to trash for easy recovery.
- **Diagnostics Hook:** Prompts about unresolved diagnostics before commit.

### 5. Release Process & Community

- Many developer contributions are acknowledged in bug fixes, documentation, and enhancements across the core and extensions.
