_Authored by Cyril Belikoff_

Azure Accelerate is a simplified offering designed to accelerate transformation for organizations by providing expert support and investments throughout their cloud and AI journey.

## The Imperative for Transformation

As technology reshapes industries, organizations increasingly rely on cloud, data, and AI solutions to create smarter operations, achieve better business outcomes, and enhance customer experiences.
