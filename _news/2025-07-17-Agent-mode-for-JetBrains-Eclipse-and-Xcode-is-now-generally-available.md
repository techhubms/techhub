## GitHub Copilot Agent Mode Now Available Across Popular IDEs

Allison reports that GitHub Copilot agent mode has reached general availability for JetBrains, Eclipse, and Xcode. This significant update means developers working in any of these major integrated development environments (IDEs) can now enable and use GitHub Copilot, regardless of their GitHub account type.

### Autonomous Coding Experience

With agent mode, developers can experience more autonomy in their workflow, leveraging Copilot to generate code, offer suggestions, and assist throughout the development process. This enhancement is aimed at making coding more efficient and accessible to a broader user base.

### Broader IDE Support

Previously, Copilot was mainly associated with Visual Studio Code. By expanding the support to JetBrains family IDEs, Eclipse, and Xcode, GitHub is widening its reach and making autonomous coding available to a larger segment of the developer community.

### How to Get Started

To enable agent mode, users simply need a GitHub account. They can then activate Copilot within their preferred IDE and begin utilizing its features to streamline their coding tasks.

This release marks a significant milestone in Copilotâ€™s journey to enhance productivity and empower developers with advanced AI coding tools.
