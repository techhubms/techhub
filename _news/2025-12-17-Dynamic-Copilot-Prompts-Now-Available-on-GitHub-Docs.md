- **Prompt Types:**
  - **Inline Prompts:** Send general questions to GitHub Copilot directly from the docs.
  - **Prompt Blocks:** Open specific GitHub-related prompts in Copilot.
  - **Prompt Blocks with Context:** Send a prompt alongside a relevant code block to Copilot for more contextual assistance.
- **Improved Workflow:** This integration allows developers to receive coding assistance or suggestions straight from the documentation, streamlining the process of getting help and staying productive.
