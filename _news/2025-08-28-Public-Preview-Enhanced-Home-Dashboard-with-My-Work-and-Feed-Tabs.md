## What's New

- **My Work Tab**: Displays a concise, customizable list of the user's most recently updated pull requests and issues.
  - Filtering options to personalize which work items are shown
  - For authored pull requests, actionable next steps are surfaced
- **Feed Tab**: Retains the earlier feed view. User's tab selection is now persistent for a streamlined experience
- The changes are available to a subset of users, with broader rollout planned as feedback is gathered

*Note: Features in public preview may evolve based on user feedback.*

These enhancements are geared toward improving productivity by reducing the time needed to locate and act on critical work items. The simplified organization of 'My Work' and 'Feed' seeks to meet the needs of developers looking for faster navigation and better visibility into their workflow.
