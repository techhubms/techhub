Allison announces the launch of the GitHub MCP Registry, making it easier for developers to discover, explore, and use MCP servers for AI agents and tools—including GitHub Copilot—within a centralized, open ecosystem.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub MCP Registry: Centralizing AI Agent Tool Discovery

Developers working with AI agents and modern coding assistants often face a fragmented landscape, with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers scattered across disconnected repositories, registries, and informal community resources. This fragmentation causes discovery difficulties for AI development tooling, increases friction for developers, and introduces unnecessary security risks.

The new **GitHub MCP Registry** directly addresses these pain points by offering a unified, curated location to browse, discover, and leverage MCP servers. Built into GitHub—already the home of most MCP implementations—the registry simplifies finding AI tools, encourages interoperability, and helps developers get started with agentic workflows more efficiently.

Key highlights:

- **Central hub** for MCP servers supporting AI agents, Copilot, and other MCP-compatible tools
- **Streamlined discovery** and onboarding for development teams building with agentic workflows
- **Reduced overhead** and duplicated effort for MCP server maintainers
- **Interoperability**: Strengthens the open ecosystem for Model Context Protocol and encourages broader tool compatibility
- **Security**: Centralization helps mitigate risks associated with obscure, unofficial registries

The initial launch includes a hand-picked selection of MCP servers. The team is collaborating with the Model Context Protocol steering committee on an [OSS MCP Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry), which will enable any server developer to self-publish and improve the reach and openness of the platform.

Developers interested in contributing or submitting their MCP servers are encouraged to:

- Explore the [GitHub MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp?utm_source=changelog-source&utm_campaign=mcp-registry-server-launch-2025)
- Engage with the Model Context Protocol community for feedback and collaboration
- Stay tuned for expanded self-service publication capabilities

The GitHub MCP Registry aims to bring clarity and speed to the growing world of AI-powered software development.
