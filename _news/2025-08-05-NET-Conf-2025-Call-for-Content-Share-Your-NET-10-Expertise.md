The .NET Conf 2025 Call for Content is now officially open! .NET Conf is the premier virtual gathering of .NET developers from around the world, and this year it’s bigger than ever with the launch of **.NET 10**. Whether you’re an experienced speaker or new to presenting, your voice and experience are valued—share your expertise and stories with the community.

## Event Details

- **When:** November 11-13, 2025
- **Where:** Online (present from anywhere)
- **Session Length:** 30 minutes (including Q&A)
- **Submission Deadline:** August 31, 2025, 11:59 PM PDT

Add the event to your calendar at [dotnetconf.net](https://dotnetconf.net).

## Why Participate in .NET Conf?

.NET Conf is a free, three-day virtual event organized by Microsoft, the .NET Foundation, and sponsors. It is a unique opportunity for developers to celebrate the .NET ecosystem, share what they’re building, and learn from each other. The 2025 edition will feature:

- **The launch of .NET 10**
- Deep dives into **.NET Aspire**
- Explorations of how **AI** is transforming .NET development
- Sessions by community members like you

## What Kind of Sessions Are Sought?

.NET Conf is looking for **30-minute sessions** that capture what’s possible with .NET. Possible topics include:

- **Web Development:** ASP.NET Core projects, Blazor applications, modern web architectures
- **Mobile & Desktop:** .NET MAUI, cross-platform tips, desktop app modernization
- **AI & Machine Learning:** ML.NET projects, integrating AI into .NET apps
- **IoT & Edge:** .NET on devices, IoT solutions, embedded .NET projects
- **Games:** Game development with .NET, Unity integrations
- **Cloud & Containers:** Containerization, microservices patterns, cloud-native applications
- **DevOps:** Effective CI/CD, real-world deployment strategies, boosting team productivity
- **Open Source:** Showcasing your libraries, contribution stories, favorite community projects

If you have compelling stories, insights or demos—related to .NET 9 or .NET 10, or just something exciting in the .NET world—the organizers want to hear from you!

## What Makes a Session Stand Out?

- **Real-world experiences:** Case studies, lessons learned, challenges overcome
- **Deep architectural insights:** How you solved complex problems
- **Open source contributions:** From library creation to significant community involvement
- **Best practices and productivity:** Practical patterns, techniques, and tools
- **Unique hacks:** Fun or unconventional uses of .NET

Sessions from all backgrounds are welcome, and some of the best presentations have come from first-time speakers with a unique perspective.

## Submission Information

- The **Call for Content closes August 31, 2025**.
- Limit is 1 session proposal per speaker to maximize community participation.
- Sessions will be scheduled according to presenter time zones.

To submit:

1. Go to [sessionize.com/net-conf-2025](https://sessionize.com/net-conf-2025)
2. Craft a compelling proposal with a great title and session description
3. Introduce yourself and highlight any relevant experience (not required)
4. Include links to past talks or project demos if available

**Tip:** Including videos of past talks or demos strengthens your proposal, giving the reviewers a sense of your presentation style.

## Join the .NET Community Celebration

.NET Conf is more than a conference—it’s a global community reunion, a chance to showcase innovation and support one another. Whether you’re building web apps, architecting mobile or desktop experiences, integrating AI, or advancing cloud and DevOps practices, your journey is valuable.

Your insights, experiments, and lessons could inspire fellow developers, solve pressing challenges, or simply brighten another dev’s day with a clever solution. Don’t underestimate the impact your perspective can have on others.
