# OpenAI GPT-5 Public Preview Launches for GitHub Copilot Users

OpenAI’s latest language model, GPT-5, is now available in public preview for GitHub Copilot, marking a significant upgrade for developers using the platform.

## Key Features and Improvements

- **Advanced Reasoning**: GPT-5 brings enhanced reasoning abilities, allowing it to tackle more complex coding tasks and large-scale implementations with limited input.
- **Improved Code Quality**: The model consistently delivers higher-quality code, offering upfront and clear explanations of its outputs and actions.
- **Agentic Collaboration**: Enhanced agentic capabilities make GPT-5 a more interactive coding assistant, supporting end-to-end workflows and intelligent suggestions.

## Availability

- GPT-5 is rolling out across all paid GitHub Copilot plans, including Copilot Chat experiences.
- Access the model on:
  - [github.com](https://github.com)
  - Visual Studio Code (`Agent`, `Ask`, and `Edit` modes)
  - GitHub Mobile (via chat model picker)
- Access will be staged—users should check back if they don’t see GPT-5 immediately.

## Enabling GPT-5 for Organizations

- **Admin Action Required**: Copilot Enterprise and Business administrators must opt-in to the GPT-5 preview by enabling the relevant policy in Copilot settings.
- Once enabled, users in these organizations can select GPT-5 from the model picker in VS Code.

## Additional Resources

- [Official documentation for Copilot model hosting](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-hosting#openai-models)
- [Join the Copilot community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/168107) to share feedback, ask questions, or explore tips from others.

Stay tuned for broader availability, and explore how GPT-5 can help transform your development experience with more advanced AI-powered capabilities.
