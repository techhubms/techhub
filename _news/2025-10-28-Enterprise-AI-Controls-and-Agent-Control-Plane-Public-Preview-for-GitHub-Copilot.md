# Enterprise AI Controls & Agent Control Plane: Public Preview

**Author:** Allison

GitHub is launching a new enterprise-level experience for managing AI systems and Copilot on GitHub Enterprise Cloud, now available to all enterprise customers. The newly introduced agent control plane provides a central suite of features tailored for organizational governance, administrative visibility, and operational control over custom agents and AI tools deployed at scale.

## Key Features of the Agent Control Plane

- **Centralized Administration:** Unified dashboard for all AI and Copilot-related admin tasks within GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
- **Custom Agent Management:** Configure and operationalize organization-defined custom agents. Use one-click push rules to protect standard file paths (`.github/agents/*.md`) and control agent assignment across your enterprise.
- **Agent Activity Insights:** View enterprise-wide sessions, filter activities by agent type and state, and navigate directly to affected repositories.
- **Detailed Audit Logging:** New audit log fields capture granular agent activity, including events like `pull_request.create` by Copilot, session state changes, and traceability to user and agent actors.
- **Permission and Access Controls:** Fine-grained permissions (FGPs) allow enterprises to delegate AI controls to specific teams and create custom roles, decentralizing oversight without broad administrative access.
- **MCP Enterprise Allowlist:** Centrally govern which Machine Connection Points (MCP) are permitted using registry URLs, with forthcoming support for VS Code and other development environments.

## Upcoming Enhancements

Soon, fine-grained permission (FGP) features for decentralized AI administration and further IDE support will become available, enabling even more customized enterprise governance strategies.

## Additional Resources

- [Documentation on AI controls and agent control plane](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-custom-agents?utm_source=changelog-docs-enterprise-controls&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25)
- [GitHub Community: Copilot Conversations](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations?utm_source=changelog-community-enterprise-controls&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25)

Enterprises are encouraged to begin experimenting with these capabilities to standardize their approach to Copilot and AI administration, enhance oversight, and meet scaling needs for advanced agentic development.
