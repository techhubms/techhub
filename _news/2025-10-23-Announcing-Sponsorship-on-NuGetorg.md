# Announcing Sponsorship on NuGet.org

NuGet.org has launched a **Sponsorship feature** to help package maintainers receive support from the community. This initiative helps strengthen and sustain the .NET and NuGet ecosystem by connecting package consumers with maintainers through popular sponsorship platforms.

## What’s New?

- **Maintainership Recognition**: Package authors can now add a Sponsorship URL, represented as a heart icon or “Sponsor this package” button, on their NuGet.org package pages.
- **Consumer Support**: Users can identify which packages need support and easily contribute to maintainers via their chosen sponsorship platforms.

## For Package Publishers: How to Set Up Sponsorship

### Prerequisites

- You must own a package on NuGet.org.
- Supported platforms: GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, Open Collective, Ko-fi, Tidelift, Liberapay.

### Steps

1. Log into [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org), access your package management page.
2. Locate the “Sponsorship Links” section.
3. Add sponsorship URLs (e.g., `https://github.com/sponsors/yourusername`). Up to 10 links per package are supported.
4. The system validates your submission. Only approved platforms are accepted.
5. Confirm, edit, or remove sponsorship links as needed.
6. Check your public package page to verify the Sponsor button appears and links display as intended.

## For Users: Supporting Your Favorite Packages

- When browsing or managing dependencies, look for the heart icon or Sponsor button, indicating maintainers are seeking support.
- Clicking the button displays available sponsorship platforms; follow the link to contribute and help keep vital packages maintained and secure.

## Important Notes

- You can update or remove links at any time; changes take effect immediately.
