In April, Microsoft introduced the preview of **SQL Audit Logs** for Fabric Data Warehouse, empowering organizations to track and retain key data warehouse events for enhanced oversight. The latest update brings an all-new, streamlined visual experience for configuring, enabling, and managing SQL Audit Logs directly within the Fabric Warehouse interface.

### 2. Granular Event Selection

- Select which types of events to log, including authentication events, data access actions, and administrative activities.
- Use a categorized interface to align auditing with organizational policies.
- By default, all events are enabled for comprehensive coverage, but you can tailor settings to reduce storage requirements and focus on critical activities.
- Expand individual action groups for precise compliance and security control.

### 3. Flexible Log Retention

- Define retention periods using the visual UI (from short-term to up to nine years), supporting a variety of compliance needs.
- Retain audit logs in OneLake with setting validation built in.

## Customer-Centric Improvements
