# Unifying Data Estates with Microsoft Fabric Data Factory: AI, Integration, and Innovation

## Overview

Microsoft Fabric Data Factory now brings together industry-leading, cloud-first data integration capabilities built on OneLake. By fusing Azure Data Factory’s pro-grade integration with Power Query’s citizen data transformation features, Fabric Data Factory offers a unified approach to connect, prepare, and manage data from multicloud and on-premises sources.

## Key Feature Updates

### Dataflow Gen2: Pricing and Performance Improvements

- Lower base rate (12 CU, down from 16 CU)
- Tiered pricing for long-running jobs (reduced cost after 10 minutes)
- Improved performance via modern PQ evaluator and partitioned query execution
- New design-time experience with fast ‘Preview only Steps’ for editing queries

### Petabyte-Scale Data Movement

- 170+ connectors for diverse data sources/destinations
- Copy job allows high-throughput, cross-cloud movement, including AWS, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and more
- Latest features: Copy job orchestration in pipelines, variable library for environment parameterization, support for new formats like Iceberg/JSON, improved scheduling, and integration with Lakehouse, SharePoint, Snowflake
- Enhanced incremental data ingestion (Change Data Feeds, CDC)

### Pro-Code & Low-Code Orchestration

- Low-code pipelines for robust scheduling and automation
- CI/CD enhancements: ADF pipeline migration utility, variable libraries, monitoring workspace
- Pro-code integration with managed Airflow for serverless DAG orchestration
- New activities: Email, Teams, SPN/Workspace identity, Dataflow parameterization

### Database Mirroring

- Zero-copy, zero-ETL data replication into OneLake from major sources (Google BigQuery, Oracle, Azure SQL, Snowflake, etc.)
- Secure access via Private Link, on-prem gateway support, and semantic modeling direct from mirrored databases

### AI-Powered Data Integration (Copilot)

- Author, debug, and monitor pipelines using AI copilots
- New features: Natural language to define columns and transformations, automate documentation, and chat-driven pipeline creation
- Upcoming: AI-powered transformation prompts for sentiment analysis, summarization, and categorization

### Security and Mission-Critical Enhancements

- Workspace identity support and Private Link for secure, credential-free connections
- Azure Key Vault integration for managing secrets
- VNet Gateway, API support, and enhanced administration via PowerShell
- Planned: Snowflake key-pair authentication for automation

## Practical Impact

- Simplifies complex data estate unification, enabling data engineers and analysts to build intelligence-driven workflows
- Reduces operational costs while increasing performance and scalability
- Empowers users of all skill levels (pro-code, low-code) to automate and transform data across clouds
- Accelerates AI and analytics adoption with integrated copilots and efficient dataflows
