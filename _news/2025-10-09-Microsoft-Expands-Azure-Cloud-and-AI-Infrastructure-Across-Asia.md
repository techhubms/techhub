# Microsoft Expands Azure Cloud and AI Infrastructure Across Asia

Microsoft is accelerating its commitment to cloud infrastructure in Asia to help organizations scale securely and tap into AI-ready services.

## Datacenter Expansions

- **New Azure datacenter regions** launched in Malaysia and Indonesia (2025), with planned expansions in India and Taiwan (2026).
- Malaysia will receive a second region (Southeast Asia 3), further deepening local infrastructure.

## Strategic Investments

Microsoft is investing billions to expand its AI infrastructure footprint:  

- Cutting-edge AI, next-generation networking, and scalable storage capabilities.
- Over 70 datacenter regions globally, 33 countries, supporting data residency and compliance.

## Infrastructure for Resilience and Scalability

- **Azure Availability Zones** (Japan West): Enhanced resilience and efficiency for cloud architectures.
- **Southeast Asia**: New regions in Indonesia Central and Malaysia West for low-latency, hyperscale cloud and AI services.
- **Multi-region approach**: Recommendations for building resilient, agile, high-performance applications spanning several Azure regions.

## Customer Use Cases and AI Services

- **Binus University**: Uses Azure Machine Learning and Azure OpenAI Service for campus operations and AI-powered academic experiences (AI tutors, generative AI, interactive learning).
- **GoTo Group**: Adopts GitHub Copilot in engineering for AI-powered coding assistance, boosting productivity and innovation.
- **PETRONAS** (Malaysia): Leverages hyperscale cloud for digital, AI transformation, and clean energy efforts.

Organizations across sectors (finance, public sector, manufacturing, retail, startups) are using locally-hosted Microsoft infrastructure to operate confidently and comply with local regulations.

## Cost Optimization and Strategies

- Newer Azure regions (e.g., Indonesia Central) offer cost-effective options to optimize cloud spending.
- Use the [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) for cloud strategies and migration.
- Apply the [Well Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) for reliability, security, and performance.

## Key Technical Points

- Microsoft architecture enables organizations to unlock data value, scale seamlessly, and innovate across local and global markets.
- Multi-region selection and distributed services improve resilience and performance.
- Customers gain access to advanced Azure, AI, and developer productivity tools (like GitHub Copilot).
