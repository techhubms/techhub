# Copilot Code Review: Now in JetBrains IDEs and Visual Studio

GitHub Copilot code review is now available in most standard editors and IDEs—including JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, and more) and Visual Studio. This update adds to existing support in Xcode and Visual Studio Code, making Copilot code review accessible to more developers than ever.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Request Copilot code review feedback from within JetBrains IDEs and Visual Studio before opening a pull request.
- Receive actionable AI feedback on your changes to catch logic, security, and performance issues early, directly within your preferred editor.
- Streamline the code review process by enabling self-review and quick iteration before involving team members.

### How to Get Started

1. Update your Copilot plugin for Visual Studio or JetBrains IDEs to the latest version.
2. Stage your changes as you would prior to a code review.
3. Click the Copilot code review button to generate feedback and AI-powered suggestions.

This feature enables efficient self-review workflows and helps improve code quality across .NET, Python, JavaScript, and more, in both Microsoft and JetBrains environments.
