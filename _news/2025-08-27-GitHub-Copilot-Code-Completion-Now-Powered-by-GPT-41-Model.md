Allison introduces the latest update to GitHub Copilot, which now leverages the GPT-4.1 model for code completion, bringing enhanced AI-powered suggestions to all users.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Copilot Code Completion Now Uses the GPT-4.1 Copilot Model

GitHub Copilot's code completion feature has been upgraded to use the GPT-4.1 Copilot model. This latest model brings key improvements for developers:

- **Expanded Coding Capabilities**: Leveraging the strengths of GPT-4.1, the new Copilot model can provide more accurate and diverse code suggestions.
- **Extended Knowledge Cutoff**: The model has access to more recent and higher quality training data, allowing for up-to-date coding practices.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The Copilot model has been refined using reinforcement learning techniques based on user feedback, leading to more relevant and context-aware code completions.
- **Automatic Availability**: All Copilot users, regardless of their subscription plan, will automatically be upgraded to the new model.
- **Model Selection**: Developers can select or confirm their completion model in the [code completion model picker](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/change-the-completion-model).

For additional information on using code suggestions with Copilot, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/get-code-suggestions/get-code-suggestions).

Feedback on the new model is welcomed in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169496).
