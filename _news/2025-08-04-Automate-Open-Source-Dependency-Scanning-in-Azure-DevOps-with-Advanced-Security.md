# Automate Open-Source Dependency Scanning in Azure DevOps with Advanced Security

*Author: Laura Jiang*

Managing security across multiple repositories and teams can be a challenge, especially when additional setup is needed for each experience. In GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps, thereâ€™s ongoing work to simplify feature enablement and make it easier to scale advanced security measures across entire enterprises.

## Automatic Injection of Dependency Scanning Tasks

A recent update makes it possible to automatically inject a dependency scanning task into any pipeline run targeting your default branch. This ensures that both your production code and any code merged into your production branch undergo evaluation for open-source dependency vulnerabilities, enhancing overall security.

### Enabling One-Click Dependency Scanning for Your Repository

To configure this feature, users need the "Advanced Security: manage settings" permission. Here are the steps:

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings:**
   - Go to **Project settings** > **Repositories** > Select your repository.

2. **Setting up for Standalone Products:**
   - Enable Code Security.
   - In **Options**, confirm the selection of **Dependency alerts default setup**.

3. **Bundled Advanced Security:**
   - Use the checkbox to enable **Scan default branch for vulnerable dependencies**.

## How Dependency Scanning Works

- On your next pipeline run targeting the default branch, the Advanced Security dependency scanning task is automatically appended near the pipeline's end. Scanning typically completes within a few minutes.
- For teams without consistent CI/CD activity, scheduled pipeline runs are recommended to maintain consistent scanning coverage.

### Flexible Exclusions

- If dependency scanning is already part of your pipeline or you have set the variable `DependencyScanning.Skip: true`, the automated task will be skipped. This is useful for pipelines that shouldn't be included in the scanning surface area.
- To skip automated scanning on specific pipeline jobs, set the pipeline variable `dependencyScanningInjectionEnabled` to `false`.

## Reviewing and Acting on Scan Results

- Upon completion, scan results are uploaded to Advanced Security and made available under **Repos** > **Advanced Security**.

- You can configure pull request annotations for dependency scanning, provided a build validation policy is set up. This injects scanning into all PRs targeting your default branch.
  - **Annotations for new findings** are surfaced directly in the pull request (after scanning the default branch at least once).
  - Existing issues shared between branches display in the Advanced Security tab.

## Next Steps and Further Learning

- Teams are encouraged to try this feature and provide feedback directly or via [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/AzureDevOps).
