# TypeScript 7 Native Preview Now Available in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders

**Author:** Sayed Ibrahim Hashimi

## Introduction

Developers using Visual Studio 2026 Insiders can now try out the new TypeScript 7 native preview. Announced by Anders Hejlsberg and Daniel Rosenwasser, this release brings substantial improvements to compile times and memory usage when working on large TypeScript projects.

## What is TypeScript 7 Native Preview?

TypeScript 7 native preview is a native port of the TypeScript compiler and language tools, aiming to speed up the development workflow:

- **Faster Compile Times**: Real-world projects such as VS Code, Playwright, TypeORM, and RxJS have seen up to 10x faster compilation.
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: The compiler now uses significantly less memory.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Operations like "Find All References" and "Go To Definition" in the IDE are faster, especially for large codebases.

| Project                    | Lines of Code | Current Compile Time | Native Compile Time | Speedup |
|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------|
| VS Code                   | 1,505,000     | 77.8s               | 7.5s               | 10.4x   |
| Playwright                | 356,000       | 11.1s               | 1.1s               | 10.1x   |
| TypeORM                   | 270,000       | 17.5s               | 1.3s               | 13.5x   |
| date-fns                  | 104,000       | 6.5s                | 0.7s               | 9.5x    |
| tRPC                      | 18,000        | 5.5s                | 0.6s               | 9.1x    |
| rxjs                      | 2,100         | 1.1s                | 0.1s               | 11.0x   |

_These benchmarks represent data from March._

## How to Enable TypeScript Native Preview

1. **Install Visual Studio 2026 Insiders Preview**: [Download here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/insiders/)
2. **Update Your Project**:
    - Edit `package.json` and replace the `typescript` package with `@typescript/native-preview`.
    - Use Visual Studio's IntelliSense for package selection.
3. **Handle Dependencies**:
    - Check for and remove other dependencies that may bring in older TypeScript versions. Consult your `package-lock.json` to identify these.
4. **Clean and Reinstall**:
    - Delete the `node_modules` folder.
    - Run `npm install`.
5. **Restart the IDE**:
    - Close and reopen Visual Studio to ensure the new language service is in use.
6. **Verify**:
    - Open a TypeScript file and check the Output window's IntelliSense tab for the version information.

## Known Issues and Limitations

This is an early-stage preview and the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem is actively adapting:

- **Dependency Conflicts**: Some packages may require older TypeScript versions, possibly causing build errors.
- **Editor Integration Gaps**: Some editor features may be incomplete, such as Quick Fixes and code colorization.
- **Component File Issues**: Editing HTML component files may show unrelated warnings/errors.

## Providing Feedback

- **TypeScript Compiler/Language Service Issues**: Report to [TypeScript Go GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go).
- **Visual Studio-specific Issues**: Use the [Developer Community portal](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/home) to report bugs or suggest features ([how to report](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio)).
