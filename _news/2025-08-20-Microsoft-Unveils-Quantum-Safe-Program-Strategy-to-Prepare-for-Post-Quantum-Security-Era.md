# Microsoft Unveils Quantum Safe Program Strategy to Prepare for Post-Quantum Security Era

Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as medicine and material science. However, it also introduces new security challenges—especially the risk that quantum computers could eventually break widely-used encryption algorithms. In response, Microsoft has released its Quantum Safe Program Strategy, a comprehensive plan for transitioning to cryptography that can withstand quantum-powered attacks.

## Why Quantum Security Matters

Modern encryption is foundational to protecting digital data, from personal information to critical global infrastructure. While practical quantum computers are still years away, attackers may already be collecting encrypted data today, intending to decrypt it in the future. The so-called “harvest now, decrypt later” threat means that action to implement quantum-safe cryptography cannot wait until quantum computers arrive.

## Microsoft's Roadmap and Commitments

- **Early Adoption:** Microsoft aims to enable quantum-safe features in its products and services by 2029, reaching full transition by 2033 (two years ahead of most government timelines).
- **Collaborations:** Microsoft is an active contributor to key initiatives including:
  - [NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Project](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization)
  - [National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/crypto-agility-considerations-migrating-post-quantum-cryptographic-algorithms)
  - [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/pquip/about/)
  - [Open Quantum Safe (OQS) Project](https://openquantumsafe.org/)
  - [MITRE’s Post-Quantum Cryptography Coalition](https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/news-release/post-quantum-cryptography-coalition-launches)
- **Standards and Adoption:** Microsoft is helping develop quantum-safe algorithms, supporting their adoption in standards (like TLS and X.509), and advocating for global interoperability. Recent releases let Windows and Linux users test post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) features early.

## Policy Recommendations for Governments

To support a timely and effective transition, Microsoft recommends governments:

- Make quantum-safe cryptography a national priority and include it in frameworks
- Harmonize standards and timelines across countries and jurisdictions
- Adopt international standards to enable interoperability
- Set aggressive timelines, well ahead of the 2030s
- Provide transparent roadmaps for transition (timelines, milestones, budgets)
- Raise awareness and skill the workforce to address quantum risks

## The Path Forward

Transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography is a complex, resource-intensive task requiring global collaboration. Microsoft’s published strategy aims to guide policymakers, customers, and industry in navigating this major security challenge. The company encourages broad partnership to ensure digital infrastructure remains protected as quantum computing advances.
