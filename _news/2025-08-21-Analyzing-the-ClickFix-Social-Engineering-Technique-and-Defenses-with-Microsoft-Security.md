Microsoft Threat Intelligence and Defender Experts offer a comprehensive analysis of the evolving ClickFix social engineering campaigns targeting enterprise users, with detailed recommendations for detecting, responding, and mitigating these attacks using Microsoft security solutions.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Analyzing the ClickFix Social Engineering Technique and Defenses with Microsoft Security

## Overview

Microsoft Threat Intelligence and Microsoft Defender Experts have observed a surge in "ClickFix" social engineering attacks. These campaigns target enterprise and end-users by tricking them into running malicious commands, often leading to information theft, remote access, or malware delivery. The article analyzes how these campaigns operate, showcases real-world attack chains, and provides actionable recommendations for detection and mitigation.

## How ClickFix Campaigns Work

### Attack Chain Summary

- **Initial Access:** Threat actors rely on phishing emails, malvertising, or compromised websites to lure victims to fake landing pages.
- **User Interaction:** The landing page imitates familiar verification dialogs (CAPTCHA, Cloudflare Turnstile, Discord server joins, etc.) and instructs users to copy and run commands in the Windows Run dialog, PowerShell, or Terminal.
- **Payload Delivery:** Executed commands often download infostealers (like Lumma Stealer, Lampion), RATs (Xworm, AsyncRAT), loaders, or rootkitsâ€”sometimes using fileless, in-memory execution through LOLBins (living-off-the-land binaries).

### Notable Observations

- ClickFix campaigns have evolved, using sophisticated obfuscation and delivery chain tactics to evade automated detection.
- Attacks have expanded beyond Windows to macOS devices, targeting a wider set of victims and employing OS-specific techniques.
- Cybercriminals sell ClickFix builder kits and services to other threat actors, accelerating attack proliferation.

## Case Studies

### Lampion Malware Campaign

- Targeted organizations in Portugal and other countries.
- Utilized phishing emails with ZIP file attachments, guiding users through multiple obfuscated steps to ultimately attempt delivering Lampion infostealer.
- Attackers made use of scheduled tasks, multi-stage scripts, and persistence via DLL execution.

### Phishing Impersonation of US Social Security Administration (SSA)

- Employed realistic phishing emails with redirectors masking malicious landing pages.
- Final landing page mimicked the SSA and contained ClickFix instructions leading to the installation of tools like ScreenConnect for remote control.

### Malvertising and Drive-By Attacks

- Fake movie streaming sites, compromised WordPress installations, and other platforms have all been leveraged to funnel victims into ClickFix lures.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Detecting ClickFix Activity

- Look for suspicious entries in the Windows RunMRU registry key (`CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU`) involving LOLBins (e.g., powershell, mshta, rundll32), or suspicious file extensions and URLs.
- Campaigns often employ obfuscation, such as Base64 encoding, string concatenation, escape characters, and nested execution patterns.
- Defender for Endpoint and Defender XDR can surface relevant threat alerts, such as suspicious command usage, scheduled tasks, or flagged malware.

### Notable Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

- Domains: `mein-lonos-cloude.de`, `access-ssa-gov.es`, `binancepizza.info`, etc.
- Malware Samples: Infostealers, rootkits, ransomware loaders.
- Key Tactics: Copy-paste social engineering, drive-by payload delivery, script obfuscation, abuse of trusted Windows/macOS binaries.

### Hunting and Detection with Microsoft Defender XDR & Sentinel

- Defender XDR and Sentinel queries are included to discover registry manipulations, PowerShell behaviors, file hashes, and network indicators associated with ClickFix.
- Example queries target RunMRU activity, process trees involving suspicious parent-child relationships, network connections to known C2 infrastructure, and more.

## Hardening and Defense Recommendations

- Educate users to recognize and avoid suspicious prompts, especially those involving the Run dialog, PowerShell, or terminal windows.
- Enable and configure [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint) and [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-office-365) for advanced threat detection, link and attachment analysis, and blocking of malicious campaigns.
- Implement Group Policy to disable unnecessary access to the Run dialog, restrict PowerShell execution, and limit native binary launches.
- Leverage [Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment-implement) and [script block logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/security/security-features?view=powershell-7.5).
- Use [network protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/network-protection) to block C2 domains and restrict access to suspicious infrastructure.

## Microsoft Security Solutions Involved

- **Microsoft Defender XDR**: Coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, and cloud services.
- **Microsoft Defender Antivirus / Endpoint**: Provides behavioral, file, and network-based detection.
- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: Advanced email protection and phishing defense.
- **Microsoft Security Copilot**: Automates investigation and response using threat intelligence and pre-built promptbooks.

## Conclusion

The ClickFix social engineering technique is an increasingly prevalent and dangerous threat vector. With evolving lures, sophisticated delivery chains, and multi-stage malware, this attack requires layered detection and defense. Microsoft Defender XDR, Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Office 365, and Security Copilot provide end-to-end protection and guidance, but user education and hardening policies remain essential for prevention.
