# Dependabot Adds Support for Conda Environment Files

Dependabot can now parse and update `environment.yml` Conda environment files, adding both security and version update capabilities for Python projects using Conda. This update enables automated dependency management and vulnerability detection for teams relying on Conda-managed environments.

## Why It Matters

Many Python teams use Conda to manage project dependencies and isolated environments. With Dependabot's new support, developers using Conda benefit from:

- **Automated Security Alerts:** Get notified about vulnerabilities in Python packages from the pip [GitHub Advisory database](https://github.com/advisories).
- **Automated Dependency Updates:** Receive pull requests with the latest dependency versions based on your `environment.yml`.
- **Greater Supply Chain Security:** Reduce risk by ensuring environments are kept up-to-date and patched.

## How It Works

- Dependabot detects Conda environment files (`environment.yml`) in repositories and creates automated pull requests for updates.
- Security alerts require submission of a dependency graph using the [Dependency Submission API](https://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/using-the-dependency-submission-api).
- Only Python packages dependencies are supported. Security advisories are sourced from GitHub's pip advisory database.

## Availability

- **Available Today:** GitHub.com users can leverage this feature now.
- **Coming Soon:** GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) support begins with version 3.20.
