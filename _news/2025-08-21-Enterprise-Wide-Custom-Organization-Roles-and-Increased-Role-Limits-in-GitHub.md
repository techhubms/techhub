# Enterprise-Wide Custom Organization Roles and Increased Role Limits in GitHub

GitHub enterprise owners can now create sets of custom organization roles that are accessible across all organizations in their enterprise. These standardized roles aim to support compliance requirements and streamline user movement and permissions management among different organizations within an enterprise.

## Key Features

- **Enterprise-Scoped Roles**: Enterprise owners define custom roles once, usable enterprise-wide.
- **Assignment & Editing**: Only enterprise owners can edit these roles. Organization owners can assign roles via organization settings or using the [organization role assignment API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/orgs/organization-roles#assign-an-organization-role-to-a-team).
- **Role Consistency**: The same permissions framework (organization/repository permissions) is used across enterprise and organization level roles.
- **Future Integration**: Enterprise, organization, and repository rulesets will soon support these roles for enhanced rule-bypassing and permissions control.
- **Role Limits Increased**: Each account (enterprise or organization) can now create up to 20 custom organization roles, allowing an organization owner to access up to 40 custom roles in addition to default ones.

## Availability and Compatibility

- This feature is now available as a public preview.
- It will be included with GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) version 3.19 and forward.
- For details on managing organization roles, see GitHubâ€™s [enterprise documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise).

## Community and Feedback

Users can provide feedback or discuss questions in the [GitHub Community Enterprise forum](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/enterprise).

*Disclaimer: The UI for features in public preview may change.*
