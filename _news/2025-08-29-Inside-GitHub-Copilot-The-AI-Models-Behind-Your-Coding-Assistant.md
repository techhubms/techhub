# Inside GitHub Copilot: The AI Models Behind Your Coding Assistant

*By Alexandra Lietzke*

GitHub Copilot has undergone a significant transformation since its launch in 2021. Initially powered by a single model—OpenAI’s Codex—the assistant now utilizes a variety of large language models (LLMs), giving developers control over which AI powers their workflows and code suggestions.

## The Shift to Multi-Model Architecture

- **Early days**: Copilot started with Codex, offering autocomplete and code generation within the IDE.
- **Now**: Copilot employs an array of advanced models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4.1, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet (multiple versions), and Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash and 2.5 Pro, accessible via model pickers for Pro+, Business, and Enterprise tiers.
- **Developer choice**: This flexibility recognizes that no single model excels at every task. Developers can select models optimized for speed, reasoning, or multimodal capabilities based on their specific needs.

## Core Features Powered by AI

- **Code Completion**: Now defaulting to OpenAI’s GPT-4.1, offering greater speed, more accurate completions, and support for over 30 programming languages.
- **Agent Mode**: For complex, multi-step tasks, Copilot employs advanced reasoning models—giving users the option to select Anthropic or Google LLMs when deeper logic is required.
- **Copilot Chat**: Powered by GPT-4.1 by default but offers alternate models, enabling users to tailor responses for speed or depth in code and development queries.
- **Coding Agent**: Automates repetitive tasks such as triaging issues, generating pull requests, patching vulnerabilities, and more, enhancing developer flow and minimizing context switching.
- **Code Review**: Now included in Copilot features and powered by GPT-4.1, with options to switch to more specialized models for extensive codebase reasoning.

## Why Model Selection Matters

Developers prioritize different aspects depending on their workflow—sometimes speed is critical, other times deep reasoning or broader context is required. Copilot’s architecture empowers developers to:

- Work using their preferred model for specific tasks.
- Seamlessly switch between chat, code generation, agent automation, and review tools.
- Leverage improvements such as faster response times and expanded context windows (GPT-4.1 is about 40% faster than previous generations).
- Access premium and experimental models through higher subscription tiers.

## Supported Models and Their Strengths

- **GPT-4.1** (OpenAI): Balanced for performance and multimodal input; default for most Copilot features.
- **Claude Sonnet series** (Anthropic): Reliable and deep reasoning, especially for large codebases.
- **Claude Opus 4/4.1**: Premium reasoning for advanced development.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash, 2.5 Pro** (Google): Emphasizing speed and multimodal capabilities.
- **o3, o4-mini, GPT-5 series** (OpenAI): Covering advanced planning, low-latency needs, and future-facing tasks.

A full breakdown of models and their best uses is provided, helping developers map the right tool to their requirement.

## Enhancing Developer Productivity

Copilot’s evolving capabilities—including agentic workflows, integration into the GitHub platform, and context-aware automations—aim to allow developers to focus on high-value tasks rather than repetitive boilerplate, test creation, or searching for code snippets. The infrastructure prioritizes maintaining flow, supporting branch protections, code review cycles, and reducing complexity.

## Looking Forward

GitHub commits to continuous improvement of Copilot’s AI foundation, ensuring that developers can access the latest advancements and productivity enhancements. Users are encouraged to experiment with the various models and tailor their experience for optimal results.
