Written by stclarke, this piece details how Daniel Kim and Arjun Oberoi’s Argus device, powered by Azure AI, won the 2025 Microsoft Imagine Cup and advances inclusive tech for people with low vision.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Argus and Azure AI: A Winning Vision for Inclusive Tech at Imagine Cup

Every year, the [Microsoft Imagine Cup](https://imaginecup.microsoft.com/en-us) recognizes the most innovative ideas from student entrepreneurs leveraging Microsoft technologies. This feature delves into the story of Argus—a wearable assistive device created by Stanford undergraduates Daniel Kim and Arjun Oberoi, awarded the 2025 Microsoft Imagine Cup for its inclusive design for the visually impaired.

## Inspiration Rooted in Personal Experience

Daniel Kim and Arjun Oberoi were inspired by their family members' experiences with vision loss. Determined to address these challenges, they developed Argus Panoptes, a two-part wearable system designed to help people with low vision navigate the world autonomously. The device recognizes objects, identifies faces, and provides spatial guidance using seamless voice interaction.

## Technical Innovation with Azure AI

Argus employs a hybrid architecture utilizing [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) and Azure AI Speech services. Key features include:

- **Local Edge Processing:** Simple commands are handled on-device for efficiency.
- **Cloud-Based Inference:** More complex tasks leverage Azure AI in the cloud for advanced processing.

Additionally, the Argus team innovated with Wi-R, an ultra-low-power wireless protocol utilizing skin surface conduction. This delivers vastly improved connectivity and power efficiency—consuming 100x less power than traditional Wi-Fi—solving major usability challenges for end users.

## Startup Journey and Microsoft for Startups

The founders’ journey included:

- Participation in Stanford entrepreneurial programs, with support from Microsoft for Startups
- Success at the Red Bull Basement 2024 U.S. National Final
- Culmination in victory at the Imagine Cup, with recognition, funding, and mentorship from Microsoft

## Impact and Community Inspiration

The Argus journey highlights how Microsoft for Startups and Azure enable student founders to turn ideas into practical, impactful solutions. Microsoft’s Annie Pearl commended the work:
> "They’re not just imagining what is possible with AI—they’re building it."

Aspiring innovators are encouraged to consider Imagine Cup 2026 for their future ideas, especially in accessibility and inclusive technology. Resources, mentorship, and scalable cloud infrastructure from Microsoft for Startups are available to help bring such visions to reality.
