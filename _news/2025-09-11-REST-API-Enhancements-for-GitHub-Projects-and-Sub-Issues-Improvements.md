Allison details GitHub's latest updates, including a REST API for Projects, improved sub-issue handling, and the renaming of the GitHub for Microsoft Teams app to GitHub Notifications.<!--excerpt_end-->

# REST API Enhancements for GitHub Projects, Sub-Issues Improvements, and More

GitHub has introduced several major updates aimed at improving project management and collaboration:

## REST API for GitHub Projects

Developers can now manage their projects programmatically through the Projects REST API. Key capabilities include:

- Listing and retrieving project details, including fields and items
- Adding and removing issues or pull requests from a project
- Updating project item field values

For complete API capabilities and usage examples, refer to [GitHub's Projects REST API documentation](https://docs.github.com/rest/projects).

## Sub-Issues Improvements

- **Inheritance:** Sub-issues now automatically inherit the Project and Milestone of their parent issue by default
- **Cross-organization Sub-issues:** You can now create sub-issues that belong to a different organization than the parent issue
- **Parent Issue Lookup:** The API now includes an endpoint to fetch the parent issue for a given sub-issue. See the [API documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/sub-issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-parent-issue) for more information

These changes aim to make it easier to break down and track work across complex, multi-organization setups.

## Sticky Sidebar for Issues

A new sticky sidebar on GitHub Issues keeps key details like assignees, labels, types, milestones, and projects visible as you scroll through long discussion threads. This quality-of-life update makes management more efficient without having to repeatedly scroll to the top.

## GitHub for Microsoft Teams App Renamed

The GitHub for Microsoft Teams app is now called **GitHub Notifications**. The change clarifies the appâ€™s role in delivering real-time GitHub notifications directly into Microsoft Teams. All core functionalities remain unchanged; users should now mention the app as `@GitHub Notifications` instead of `@GitHub`.
