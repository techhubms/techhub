# Expanded File Type Support for Attachments in GitHub

GitHub has released an update expanding the range of file types users can upload as attachments to issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments. This change is aimed at making collaboration and sharing among development teams more streamlined and robust.

## What's New

- **Wider Range of Supported File Types:**
  - **Code and Data:** `.py`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.css`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.js`, `.sql`, `.java`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.sh`, `.php`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.cs`, `.ipynb`, `.pdb`, `.xlsm`, `.tsv`, `.drawio`, `.bin`
  - **Documents:** `.rtf`, `.doc`
  - **Text and Email-Related:** `.debug`, `.msg`, `.eml`, `.copilotmd`
  - **Images:** `.bmp`, `.tif`, `.tiff`
  - **Audio:** `.mp3`, `.wav`

## How Developers Benefit

- **Easier Sharing:** Developers can now attach logs, code snippets, configuration files, spreadsheets, diagrams, and more directly to their ongoing conversations and code reviews.
- **More Flexible Collaboration:** Project teams can discuss specifics related to many additional file types without relying on external sharing services.
- **Enhanced Communication:** Attaching the right file formats in context helps resolve issues and answer questions more efficiently.
