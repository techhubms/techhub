# Ask Copilot Coding Agent to Make Changes in Any Pull Request with @copilot

GitHub Copilot has introduced an enhancement that lets you ask the Copilot coding agent to make changes to any active pull request (PR) by mentioning `@copilot` in a comment. This capability builds on Copilot's existing support for opening new PRs and now extends its assistance into modifying ongoing code reviews.

## How It Works

- **Delegate a task:** Mention `@copilot` in a comment on an existing pull request.
- **Autonomous editing:** Copilot, acting as an asynchronous background agent, will create a new pull request on top of your active PR, using the same branch as the base.
- **Review cycle:** After completing the requested changes, Copilot asks for your review by opening the new PR, making it clear that the changes merge into your ongoing work.
- **Full control:** Your original PR remains untouched until you choose to merge Copilotâ€™s proposed updates into your branch. Pull requests merging into another pull request are now visually marked as such for clarity.

## Availability and Setup

- The Copilot coding agent feature is available to Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise subscribers.
- For Copilot Business and Enterprise users, an administrator must enable Copilot coding agent from the [Policies page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/enabling-copilot-coding-agent?utm_source=changelog-docs-mention-copilot-in-pr&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25) prior to use.
