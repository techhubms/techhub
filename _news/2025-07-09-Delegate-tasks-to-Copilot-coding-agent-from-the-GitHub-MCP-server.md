In this article, Allison introduces a recent update to the GitHub MCP server, highlighting the addition of a powerful tool that allows users to delegate tasks to the GitHub Copilot coding agent. <!--excerpt_end--> This new capability lets developers hand off coding tasks to Copilot, which then works on them in the background, improving workflow and enabling multitasking. The integration streamlines development processes by allowing Copilot to autonomously handle or assist with specific coding activities, freeing up developers to focus on more complex or immediate work. The article outlines how users can start tasks with the coding agent, the types of tasks suitable for delegation, and the benefits this brings to productivity. By leveraging Copilotâ€™s AI-driven suggestions and automation, teams can accelerate software development, reduce manual effort, and consistently maintain code quality while parallelizing workloads. The update marks a significant step in embedding AI-powered agents into the daily toolkit of developers using GitHub.
