# Semantic Kernel and Microsoft Agent Framework

**Author:** Shawn Henry, Product Lead – Semantic Kernel, AutoGen and Microsoft Agent Framework

## Announcement and Overview

Last week, Microsoft announced the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework), an open-source engine designed for building agentic AI applications. This framework builds on the team’s past learnings from Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, with a focus on providing a unified, enterprise-ready platform for developing, deploying, and managing sophisticated AI agents.

- [Blog Announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/)
- [Documentation](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/Docs)
- [Demos: AI Show and Open at Microsoft](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework/AIShow)
- [Step-by-step Learning Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/develop-ai-agents-on-azure/), [AI Agents for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners)

## Relationship to Semantic Kernel and AutoGen

Microsoft Agent Framework is positioned as the successor to Semantic Kernel for building AI agents. It aims to provide:

- **Unified development experience** for agentic AI apps
- **Deep integration** with Microsoft and Azure ecosystems
- **Extensibility** for a range of models and tools (not limited to Microsoft)

Semantic Kernel and AutoGen informed the design of Microsoft Agent Framework. The same team is behind all three initiatives.

## Migration and Support Guidance

- Microsoft Agent Framework is considered an evolution—think of it as "Semantic Kernel v2.0."
- **Semantic Kernel v1.x** will continue to receive support for at least one year after Agent Framework reaches General Availability, including bug and security fixes.
- Most new features will target the new framework, but critical updates and some feature GA milestones will still reach Semantic Kernel v1.x.
- [Migration guides](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/dotnet/samples/SemanticKernelMigration) are provided for both .NET and Python libraries.

## Platform Support

Microsoft intends to maintain feature parity and ongoing support across both Python and C#/.NET for features at General Availability (GA). However, preview features may first appear in one language or another, depending on team resources.

## Project Recommendations

- **Existing projects**: No immediate need to switch from Semantic Kernel unless features in Agent Framework are required.
- **New projects**: If possible, start with Microsoft Agent Framework, especially if you can wait for General Availability or need features exclusive to the new framework.

## Community and Naming

- Developers from the Semantic Kernel and AutoGen communities are encouraged to transition and contribute feedback.
- Branding experiments (such as "Semantogen") were considered and humorously dismissed.

## Feedback and Community Links

- Engage via [GitHub Discussions](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/) and [Discord](https://aka.ms/foundry/discord).

**Happy coding!**
