# Microsoft and NVIDIA Announce Major AI Advancements for Azure AI and Edge

**Author:** Omar Khan

Microsoft has announced significant enhancements to its AI platform through an expanded partnership with NVIDIA, introducing enterprise-grade AI solutions built for scalability, performance, and flexibility across hybrid and edge environments.

## Azure AI Foundry: Enabling Scalable Enterprise AI

- Azure AI Foundry provides a robust platform for organizations to build, deploy, and scale AI applications and agents, leveraging NVIDIA’s advanced GPU technologies.
- New NVIDIA Nemotron and Cosmos models are available in Azure AI Foundry, supporting multimodal reasoning, coding, scientific analysis, robotics planning, and document intelligence.
- Microsoft TRELLIS, available via Microsoft Research, uses generative AI to create accurate 3D assets for digital twins, immersive retail and gaming experiences, and simulation workflows.

## Expanded GPU Support on Azure Local

- Azure Local now features NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU support, enabling distributed AI and visual compute workloads in hybrid, edge, and sovereign environments.
- Supports edge use cases such as healthcare diagnostics, public safety video analytics, predictive maintenance, and secure low-latency inferencing in disconnected or regulated environments.
- Azure Arc integration lets customers manage on-premises AI workloads with the simplicity of the cloud.
- Supported hardware includes Dell AX-770, HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen12, and Lenovo ThinkAgile MX650a V4.

## Key Edge and Hybrid AI Innovations

- Edge Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers sovereign AI deployments with secure, scalable inferencing on local data.
- Azure AI Video Indexer (enabled by Azure Arc) allows for real-time and recorded video analytics at the edge.
- Virtual desktop and AI-enhanced graphical capabilities are bolstered by NVIDIA vGPU and Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) features.

## Enterprise GPU Orchestration with NVIDIA Run:ai on Azure

- NVIDIA Run:ai is now deeply integrated with Azure, allowing enterprises to dynamically allocate and manage GPU resources across Azure NC, ND series, AKS, and Azure AI Foundry environments.
- Benefits include one-click job submission, automated queueing, and integrated governance.
- Orchestration tools help teams efficiently share and prioritize GPU resources, reducing operational friction and driving AI innovation.
- Vertical use cases cover medical image analysis, financial modeling, manufacturing quality control, and personalized retail (recommendation engines).

## Cutting-Edge AI Infrastructure: NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 Supercomputing Cluster

- Microsoft is first to deploy the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 cluster at scale on Azure, with 4600+ NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs per rack, designed for demanding AI workloads.
- Enhanced with Azure Boost and integrated hardware security modules for high security and I/O performance.
- This infrastructure supports the training and deployment of frontier and multimodal AI models at unprecedented speeds and efficiency.

## High-Performance Inference with ND GB200-v6 VMs and NVIDIA Dynamo

- Microsoft and NVIDIA have optimized stack performance for large-scale inference workloads, combining ND GB200-v6 VMs, NVIDIA Dynamo, and AKS.
- Demonstrated production performance on the gpt-oss 120b model, with up to 1.2 million tokens per second throughput.
- Dynamo framework offers distributed inference, LLM-aware routing, and advanced caching for maximum efficiency on Blackwell GPUs.
