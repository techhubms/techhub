# Securing Modern Education with Windows 11: AI, Intune, and Learning Zone

Schools face evolving challenges in maintaining secure, effective, and scalable technology. Windows 11 Education provides a robust foundation with:

## Security Built-in

- **Microsoft Defender** for real-time threat protection and automatic updates.
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0** for hardware-level security, safeguarding school and student data.
- **Centralized management via Microsoft Intune**, enabling IT teams to maintain consistency across devices and simplify troubleshooting.

## AI-Powered Learning Experiences

- **Copilot+ PCs** deliver enhanced performance and on-device AI features supporting innovative teaching—all within Windows 11's secure framework.
- **Learning Zone**: A Windows app developed for educators, utilizing on-device AI to create personalized lessons from existing materials. Runs locally for privacy and allows control over student data.
- **AI-powered tools from partners**: Integrations with NASA, OpenStax, Minecraft Education, and Kahoot! promote interactive and engaging learning.

## Real-World Deployment Example

- **Ceibal (Uruguay)**: The migration to Windows 11 streamlined device management, improved compatibility, and increased platform engagement from 55% to 86%. Maintenance and update costs dropped, and security was enhanced.

## Upgrade Planning and Support

- **Windows 10 End of Support**: Approaching October 14, 2025. Schools are provided multiple upgrade pathways:
  - Upgrade eligible devices using built-in tools like PC Health Check.
  - Replace devices as needed, leveraging trade-in and recycling programs.
  - Enroll older devices in the Extended Security Update (ESU) program for continued protection (tiered pricing).
- **Assessment and migration tools** are available for institution readiness and cost-benefit planning.

## Accessibility and Performance

- Enhanced multitasking, faster boot times, improved battery life, and accessibility tools (voice typing, live captions) make Windows 11 suitable for diverse classrooms.

## Key Resources

- [Microsoft Defender for Education](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender)
- [Learning Zone Preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educationblog/whats-new-in-microsoft-edu---back-to-school-august-2025/4425287)
- [Windows 11 Education Products](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/products/windows)

Educators and IT admins are encouraged to begin planning their Windows 11 transition, leveraging Microsoft’s resources to maintain secure, AI-ready, and future-focused learning environments.
