Microsoft Fabric Blog explains how to use AzCopy for transferring data from firewall-enabled Azure Storage accounts to Microsoft OneLake, highlighting secure access setup and performance best practices.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Load Data from Network-Protected Azure Storage Accounts to Microsoft OneLake with AzCopy

AzCopy is a powerful command-line tool designed for copying large datasets between Azure Storage and Microsoft OneLake. This guide demonstrates how to use AzCopy to transfer data securely from firewall-enabled Azure Storage accounts directly into OneLake, leveraging recent improvements for trusted workspace access.

## Key Advantages of AzCopy

- **Performance**: Supports high-throughput, large-scale data movement
- **Security**: Now compatible with firewall-protected storage using trusted workspace access
- **Ease of Use**: Simplifies complex data transfer scenarios with straightforward commands

## What is Trusted Workspace Access?

Trusted workspace access enables secure communication between Microsoft Fabric workspaces and firewall-enabled Azure Storage accounts. By registering a workspace managed identity and creating a corresponding resource instance rule on the storage account, Fabric services (including OneLake shortcuts, pipelines, DW copy, semantic models, and AzCopy operations) can directly access protected storage.

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a Workspace Managed Identity**
   - Configure the identity in workspace settings.
   - [More information](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/load-data-from-network-protected-azure-storage-accounts-to-microsoft-onelake-with-azcopy/)
2. **Add a Resource Instance Rule to Azure Storage**
   - Grant the workspace identity explicit access via the firewall’s resource instance rules.
   - Sample ARM templates and configuration guidance are available in Fabric documentation.
3. **Copy Data Using AzCopy**
   - Reference your managed identity and set trusted suffixes in your command:

   ```bash
   azcopy copy \
   "https://contosostorage.dfs.core.windows.net/sales/customers.csv" \
   "http://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/contosoWorkspace/contosoLakehouse.Lakehouse/Files/sales/customers.csv" \
   --trusted-microsoft-suffixes "fabric.microsoft.com"
   ```
