Allison announces an improvement to GitHub Copilot: assigning an issue to Copilot now also assigns you automatically, enhancing issue tracking and visibility in collaborative development projects.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Assigning GitHub Copilot to an Issue Now Also Assigns You

When you assign an issue to Copilot in GitHub, you will now automatically be added as an assignee. This enhancement makes it easier to track your tasks and responsibilities using filters like `assignee:@me`, helping everyone understand who is actively working on each issue.

## Key Details

- **Automatic Assignment:** Assigning Copilot to any issue also adds you (the assigning user) as an assignee.
- **Improved Work Tracking:** This change streamlines task management and personal workload tracking via GitHub's filtering tools.
- **Clarity of Responsibility:** Makes it clear who is participating in the issue, alongside Copilot.
- **Public Preview:** This feature is in public preview; UI and behavior may evolve.

## Additional Resources
