# Microsoft Elevate Washington: Bringing AI Access and Skills Statewide

**Overview**

Microsoft announced the launch of Elevate Washington, a major effort to make AI technology and training available for every high school and community college student and educator across Washington state. The initiative addresses the current digital divide, where AI usage varies significantly between urban and rural areas.

## The Challenge

Analysis by Microsoft's AI for Good Lab reveals that AI adoption in Washington state is highly uneven. Urban counties like Snohomish see AI usage above 35%, while some rural counties have less than 3% usage. This disparity could create a long-term opportunity gap as AI technologies reshape work and learning.

## The Initiative: Microsoft Elevate Washington

Microsoft is launching Elevate Washington to ensure every community in the state can access AI technology and develop vital AI skills. The initiative was designed in consultation with educators and local organizations, focusing on practical support for teachers and students.

### Key Offerings

#### For School Districts and Community Colleges

- **Copilot Studio Access:** All 295 public school districts and 34 community colleges will get free access (3 years) to Copilot Studio, enabling creation of custom AI agents for administration and learning without coding.
- **Consulting Grants:** Up to 10 districts and 10 colleges will receive $25,000 each in technology consulting for building and deploying AI agents, with successful models shared statewide.

#### For High School Students

- **Free AI Tools:** Starting July 2026, students (grades 9–12) will get three years of free access to Copilot Chat, Microsoft 365 apps, Learning Accelerators, and Teams for Education.
- **Learning Benefits:** These tools support AI fluency, productivity, digital literacy, reading and critical thinking skills, and personalized guidance.

#### For Community College Students

- **Microsoft 365 Personal:** 12 months of free Microsoft 365 Personal, including Copilot integration and Office apps, plus one terabyte of storage and creative tools, available through November 2025.

#### For Educators

- **Professional Development:** AI training for teachers and administrators, delivered in partnership with state agencies and educators associations, focuses on integrating AI into teaching and streamlining administrative tasks.
- **Innovation Summit:** Participating in a state summit to drive AI adoption and share best practices.
- **Grants:** Cash and training grants to help integrate AI in lesson preparation, instruction, and school management.

### Community Engagement

- Partnerships with organizations like Code.org bring resources such as 'Hour of AI' to students and regional workshops led by Microsoft employees.
- Support for youth workers and community leaders through tailored, generative AI training.
- Open call for education innovators to help build scalable AI-enabled solutions.

### Broader Commitment

Elevate Washington builds upon Microsoft's global Elevate initiative, which is committing $4 billion over 5 years to support educational institutions worldwide with technology and funding.

## Outlook

Microsoft’s ongoing commitment targets equitable AI access and skill-building for students, educators, and community members. By making advanced tools and professional development widely available, Microsoft hopes to ensure every part of Washington state can participate in the coming era of AI-driven opportunity and innovation.
