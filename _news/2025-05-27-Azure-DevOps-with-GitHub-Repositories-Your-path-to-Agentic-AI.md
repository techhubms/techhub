Aaron Hallberg outlines how GitHub Copilot’s agentic AI features, when integrated with Azure DevOps and GitHub Repositories, are reshaping key aspects of software development.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

In this article, Aaron Hallberg details the rapid evolution of GitHub Copilot from a simple coding assistant to a proactive, agentic team member within the software development lifecycle. The article emphasizes how Copilot now offers features beyond code completion, such as providing actionable feedback on pull requests, automatically fixing bugs, implementing new features, and actively participating in the code review process.

## Agentic AI in Practice

The article highlights the growing role of agentic AI capabilities in development workflows. GitHub Copilot is increasingly able to:

- Review and suggest changes for pull requests
- Fix bugs with minimal human intervention
- Implement new features as specified in developer prompts
- Create pull requests and respond dynamically to reviewer feedback

These advanced capabilities are beginning to automate many of the repetitive or process-intensive parts of software engineering, reducing manual effort and speeding up feedback cycles.

## Azure DevOps and GitHub Repositories Integration

The piece explores the integration between Azure DevOps and GitHub Repositories as a key enabler of these agentic workflows. By leveraging Azure DevOps, teams can orchestrate end-to-end development processes, while GitHub Repositories—augmented with Copilot—bring AI-powered assistance directly into version control and collaborative coding.

## Transforming the Software Development Lifecycle

The new agentic AI features promised by Copilot are already influencing every stage of the software development lifecycle, from planning through deployment. Key benefits include improved productivity, reduced context-switching, and enhanced code quality as Copilot continually provides feedback and implements changes based on team needs.

## Conclusion

As GitHub Copilot continues to evolve, its integration with Azure DevOps and GitHub Repositories signals a broader shift toward AI-empowered development practices. Organizations leveraging these tools can expect more automation, faster delivery, and higher quality throughout their development pipelines.
