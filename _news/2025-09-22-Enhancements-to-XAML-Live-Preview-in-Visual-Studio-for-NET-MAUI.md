# Enhancements to XAML Live Preview in Visual Studio for .NET MAUI

The XAML Live Preview feature in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14 introduces a much-improved workflow for developers building .NET MAUI applications:

## Design-Time Availability

- **Live Preview during design time:** You can now open the XAML Live Preview window without starting a debug session, allowing immediate feedback on XAML changes.
- **Faster UI iteration:** Real-time updates help streamline and speed up the design process.
- **Hot Reload & live UI tools:** Continue to use Hot Reload alongside Live Preview for more efficient development.
- **Element inspection:** Select elements in the preview to navigate to their XAML source.
- **Layout tools:** Use zoom, ruler, and docking for effective layout analysis.

## Multi-Platform Support

- **Android devices and emulators:** Beyond Windows, preview your UI on Android devices or emulators for cross-platform consistency.

## GitHub Copilot and Vision Integration

- **AI-assisted XAML authoring:** GitHub Copilot is supported within this workflow and can suggest or complete XAML code.
- **Copilot Vision:** Attach a reference image to have Copilot generate corresponding XAML, with real-time Live Preview updates for easier prototyping and refining.

## Getting Started

- **Supported versions:**
    - Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14
    - Visual Studio 2026 Insiders release
- **Documentation & video:**
    - [Official XAML Live Preview Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/xaml-tools/xaml-live-preview)
    - [Feature walkthrough video](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/25166_MauiAgentVS2026_v2.mp4)

These enhancements provide a faster, more visual workflow for .NET MAUI developers, leveraging both manual tools and GitHub Copilot’s AI capabilities for a modern, productive experience.
