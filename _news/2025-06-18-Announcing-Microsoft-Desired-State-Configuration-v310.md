### Overview of DSC v3.1.0

DSC v3.1.0 is the result of close collaboration with partners and the DSC community, with notable contributions and support from the Windows Package Manager (WinGet) team. The platform standardizes configuration management and expands integration scenarios for IT professionals and developers.
