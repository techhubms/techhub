Herain Oberoi presents findings from a Forrester Consulting study on Microsoft Purview, showing how unified data security and governance can reduce breach likelihood and automate compliance processes.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Microsoft Purview Achieves 30% Reduction in Data Breach Likelihood

**Author:** Herain Oberoi

A recent Total Economic Impactâ„¢ (TEI) study by Forrester Consulting, commissioned by Microsoft, explores how Microsoft Purview helps organizations modernize their data protection strategies. The study focuses on benefits delivered by unifying data security, governance, and compliance under a single platform.

## Why Unified Data Security Is Critical

With increasing reliance on cloud platforms, AI, and remote collaboration, managing data security has become highly complex. The risks from cyberattacks, insider threats, and accidental data leaks are exacerbated by fragmented tools and manual processes. Regulatory compliance is an ongoing concern, with laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA applying across industries. The TEI study found that organizations faced a 70% annual likelihood of a data breach, with costs potentially exceeding $3.3 million.

## Key Findings from the Study

- **30% Reduction in Data Breach Likelihood:** Organizations implementing Microsoft Purview saw a significant reduction in data breach risk, primarily through fine-tuned Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies and improved visibility into sensitive data across clouds, devices, and apps. This led to savings of over $225,000 annually from avoiding incidents and regulatory fines.
- **Investigation Time Reduced by 75%:** Security teams benefited from centralized audit logs, automated alerts, and machine learning-informed policies, which enabled faster detection and response to threats.
- **75% User Productivity Gain:** Automated data classification and centralized access supported compliance and reduced time spent searching for and classifying data.
- **Compliance Automation:** Manual effort for compliance and audit tasks was cut by 60%, due to tools that automated classification, retention, and audit workflows.
- **Legacy Cost Avoidance:** Consolidating security and governance tools led to savings of nearly $500,000 over three years, reducing IT complexity and improving interoperability.
- **Cultural Shift:** Security and compliance became shared responsibilities, integrating these teams into broader business planning.

## Unified Information Governance

By consolidating data classification, access control, and compliance monitoring, organizations reduce risk and create a more agile data environment. Consistent policy application across the data lifecycle lowers the chance of human error and supports innovation without compromising security.

## Actionable Next Steps

1. **Protect and Govern:** Assess your data landscape and classify sensitive data.
2. **Safeguard for AI Innovation:** Apply encryption and rights management to all applications.
3. **Automate Compliance:** Use tools like Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager to stay current with regulatory requirements and simplify audit reporting.
