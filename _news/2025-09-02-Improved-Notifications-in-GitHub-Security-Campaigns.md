Allison provides an update on GitHub's security campaigns, introducing enhanced notifications for developers and highlighting integration with GitHub Copilot Autofix as part of the platform's security and collaboration improvements.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Improved Notifications in GitHub Security Campaigns

Starting today, developers with `write` access to repositories involved in security campaigns will automatically receive email notifications, even if they have not subscribed to repository activity. Previously, users were required to subscribe to **All activity** or **Security alerts** to be notified of relevant events, such as the creation of new campaigns or when campaigns reached their due dates.

## Key Changes and Impact

- **Automatic Notifications:** Developers best positioned to address security alerts will now be automatically kept in the loop about their security team's priorities.
- **Streamlined Collaboration:** These improvements aim to make developer communication and collaboration around security issues more seamless, reducing the chance of missing critical remediation tasks.
- **Security Campaigns:** GitHub security campaigns allow teams to prioritize and rapidly tackle application security debt. They leverage tools like GitHub Copilot Autofix, which can suggest fixes automatically when campaigns are created.
- **Availability:** Security campaigns and these improvements are available to users of GitHub Code Security on GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
