In this article, Allison outlines significant enhancements to Copilot code review, emphasizing improvements in managing and reviewing large pull requests—particularly those involving over 20 files. <!--excerpt_end--> This update addresses a pain point experienced by many developers: the challenge of efficiently reviewing large-scale changes. Approximately 30% of all GitHub pull requests affect more than 20 files, making comprehensive and timely code review difficult with traditional methods.

The improved Copilot code review utilizes advanced AI techniques for smarter analysis, offering targeted feedback and highlighting critical issues more effectively in large PRs. By better handling the scale and complexity of substantial changes, these upgrades aim to streamline workflow, reduce review time, and improve code quality.

Key takeaways include: improved scalability for code review, enhanced productivity for developers and maintainers, and expanded applicability of Copilot’s code review features across diverse repositories. The article emphasizes GitHub’s ongoing commitment to leveraging AI for better developer experiences and more robust software development practices.
