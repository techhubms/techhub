# Enhanced Copilot Issue Assignment: Pick Repository and Base Branch

GitHub has introduced a set of improvements for assigning issues to Copilot coding agents within the public preview phase. These changes allow developers to more precisely guide Copilot in their workflows and tailor automation to their project's needs.

## Key New Features

- **Assign to Copilot Button:** Start Copilot assignments with a single click, making it faster to designate tasks.
- **Repository Selection:** Choose any accessible repository for Copilot to operate in, regardless of where the issue or code resides.
- **Branch Selection:** Direct Copilot's work by picking the relevant branchâ€”whether that's a feature branch, bug fix branch, or another starting point for the assignment.
- **Additional Instructions:** Optionally include extra context, requirements, or guidance to ensure Copilot understands the exact desired outcome for the task.

These enhancements streamline the workflow for developers who manage multiple repositories or need more granular control when delegating code tasks to Copilot.

## Getting Started

To use the new features:

1. Go to your GitHub issue.
2. Click the **Assign to Copilot** button.
3. Select the target repository and branch.
4. Add any specific instructions as needed.
5. Initiate Copilot to begin working on the assigned issue.
