# Open Source AI Editor: First Milestone

*Published June 30th, 2025 by the VS Code Team*

The Visual Studio Code (VS Code) team has officially open sourced the GitHub Copilot Chat extension, marking a significant step toward making VS Code the first open source AI editor.

## Why Open Source GitHub Copilot Chat?

The team emphasizes community-driven innovation and data transparency as primary motivators. By open sourcing AI experiences within VS Code, the team aims to leverage the creativity and expertise of the vibrant open-source developer community. They believe that AI should be developed openly alongside the core editor, encouraging greater transparency in how AI-powered features are implemented.

## What Does This Mean for Developers?

- **Explore the Codebase:** The full source code for GitHub Copilot Chat is now available on [GitHub](http://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat) under the MIT license.
- **Transparency:** Developers can review system prompts, implementation details, agent mode logic, and telemetry capture, providing full visibility into how Copilot Chat works.
- **Learning Opportunity:** You can understand and experiment with how agent mode operates, including how context is sent to LLMs and how prompt engineering is managed in an open-source setting.
- **Contribution Welcomed:** The team invites feedback, pull requests, and issue reports from the community. All issues are currently tracked in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Roadmap and What’s Next

- The current focus is on carefully refactoring components of the Copilot Chat extension into the VS Code core codebase.
- The original GitHub Copilot extension (for inline completions) remains closed source for now, but the team plans to eventually provide those features via the open sourced Copilot Chat extension.
- Ongoing partnership with the open source AI community to refine the future development roadmap and ensure coverage of impactful scenarios.
