# Semantic Kernel: Package Previews, Graduations & Deprecations

*By Sophia Lagerkrans-Pandey & Sergey Menshykh*

This post summarizes the latest updates, package lifecycle changes, and clean-up efforts across the Semantic Kernel .NET codebase, all geared toward improving maintainability, API alignment, and user experience. Here are the key details regarding package graduations, deprecations, and significant improvements:

## Graduations

### Plugins.Core Package Graduated to Preview

- The `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Plugins.Core` package moves from “alpha” to “preview,” indicating it is now considered mature and stable for broader utilization.
- No new features were added, but the change signals that the package is suitable for those building on Semantic Kernel’s core plugins.

### PromptTemplates.Liquid Package Graduated

- The `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Liquid` prompt template package has also graduated.
- Package validation is now enabled to enforce quality and compatibility requirements.

## Spring Cleaning – Deprecations

### Markdown Package Deprecated

- The `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Markdown` package has been deprecated and removed due to lack of usage.
- For those still using it, a [migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/support/migration/functions-markdown-migration-guide) is available.

### Math and Wait Plugins Removed

- The Math and Wait plugins, present since the project’s early stages, were removed due to diminished relevance.

### OpenAI and Handlebars Planners Deprecated

- The `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Planners.Handlebars` and `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Planners.OpenAI` planners have been deprecated in favor of more robust alternatives, such as function calling.
- These are now discontinued on NuGet. Users should consult the [stepwise planner migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/support/migration/stepwise-planner-migration-guide?pivots=programming-language-csharp).

## Improvements & Updates

### Plugins.Core Package API

- The "experimental" designation was removed, reflecting stable production usage.

### Stable OpenAPI API

- The experimental tag was also removed from the OpenAPI API, and package validation was enabled to ensure ongoing robustness.

### SessionsPythonPlugin Updates

- **API Migration:** Updated to the latest Azure code interpreter API version (`2024-10-02-preview`), introducing breaking changes to the public API. [Migration guide here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/support/migration/sessions-python-plugin-migration-guide-2025)
- **Structured Results:** Results from Python code execution are now a dedicated type, allowing for cleaner, more structured downstream integration.
- **Request Handling:** Propagation of cancellation tokens through kernel functions enables graceful termination and improved management of resources and responsiveness.
- **Domain Control:** Ability to restrict outbound requests to certain domains, improving security and configurability.
- **HTTP Consistency:** Refactored for consistent `SendWithSuccessCheckAsync` HTTP extension method usage, aligning with core Semantic Kernel practices.
- **Code Clean-up:** Consolidation of functionality, improved logging, and readability.
- **Integration Tests:** New tests were added for reliability and early issue detection.

These changes are part of ongoing efforts to keep Semantic Kernel clean, robust, and developer-friendly. For migration from deprecated or changed components, refer to the linked Microsoft documentation.
