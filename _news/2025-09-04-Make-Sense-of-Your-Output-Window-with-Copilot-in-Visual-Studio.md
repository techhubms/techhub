# Make Sense of Your Output Window with Copilot in Visual Studio

Ever found yourself staring at endless lines in the Output Window, trying to decipher build errors or cryptic debug messages? You're not alone—it's a common challenge for developers who rely on the Output Window for insight into builds, tests, source control, and more.

## Smarter Assistance with Copilot

In Visual Studio 17.14, Copilot gains a powerful new feature: it can read your Output Window content and assist you directly within your workflow. Here’s how it changes the process:

- **Highlight Log Sections:** Select any portion of the logs you want help with (build, debug, tests, etc.).
- **Invoke Copilot Chat:** Right-click and choose Copilot Chat. Alternatively, mention the Output Window in natural language for Copilot to respond on its own.
- **Receive Contextual Help:** Copilot will analyze the logs, provide explanations, suggest next steps, or troubleshoot specific errors.

## Developer Benefits

- **Faster Debugging:** Skip wading through dense logs—just ask Copilot questions directly.
- **Actionable Insights:** Get suggestions on resolving issues, not just raw explanations.
- **Stay in Your Workflow:** No need to switch contexts or hunt documentation for obscure error codes.
- **Works Across Output Types:** Use with Build, Debug, Tests, Source Control, Package Manager, and more.

## How Output Window Context Works

- Supports Visual Studio 17.14 and later.
- Works in multiple Output Window tabs (Build, Debug, Tests, etc.).
- Copilot may proactively offer guidance based on your prompts.

## Additional Resources

- **Visual Studio Hub:** [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/hub/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/hub/)
  - Access release notes, videos, social updates, and community content.
- **Developer Community:** [https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/VisualStudio](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/VisualStudio)
  - Submit feedback, report issues, and share ideas.

## Conclusion

By bringing Copilot's AI-powered assistance directly to the Output Window, Visual Studio makes it easier for every developer—from beginners to experts—to understand logs, fix problems, and focus on building great software.
