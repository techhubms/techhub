# Upcoming Deprecation of Select Copilot Models from Claude, OpenAI, and Gemini

By **Kate Catlin**

GitHub is committed to delivering a fast, high-quality Copilot experience for developers. As part of this commitment, GitHub regularly evaluates existing AI models and retires older versions in favor of more capable alternatives.

## Models Scheduled for Deprecation

Effective **October 23, 2025**, the following models will be deprecated across all GitHub Copilot experiences, including Copilot Chat, inline edits, ask and agent modes, and code completions:

| Model                     | Deprecation Date | Suggested Alternative |
|---------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Claude Sonnet 3.7         | 2025-10-23       | Claude Sonnet 4       |
| Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking| 2025-10-23       | Claude Sonnet 4       |
| Claude Opus 4             | 2025-10-23       | Claude Opus 4.1       |
| GPT o3                    | 2025-10-23       | GPT-5                 |
| GPT o1 mini               | 2025-10-23       | GPT-5 mini            |
| GPT o3 mini               | 2025-10-23       | GPT-5 mini            |
| GPT o4 mini               | 2025-10-23       | GPT-5 mini            |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash          | 2025-10-23       | Gemini 2.5 Pro        |

## Action Steps

- **Update Integrations:** Developers and system administrators should migrate workflows and integrations to supported models ahead of the deprecation date.
- **Review Model Policies:** Copilot Enterprise admins may need to enable new models within model policies found in Copilot settings.
- **Verify Availability:** Check your personal Copilot settings in VS Code or on GitHub.com to confirm newly enabled models appear in the Copilot Chat model selector.
- **No Removal Actions Needed:** Once deprecated, GitHub will automatically remove access to the affected models—no manual intervention is required.
