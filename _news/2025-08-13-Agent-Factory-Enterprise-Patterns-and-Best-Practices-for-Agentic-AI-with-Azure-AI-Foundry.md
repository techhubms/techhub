# Agent Factory: The New Era of Agentic AI—Common Use Cases and Design Patterns

**Author: Yina Arenas**

Agentic AI is transforming how enterprises approach automation. Rather than simply providing information, AI agents now reason, act, and collaborate—delivering outcomes that bridge the gap between knowledge and real-world impact. This post, the first in a six-part "Agent Factory" series, introduces core concepts, patterns, and tools for building agentic AI using Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry.

## From Knowledge Retrieval to Agentic Action

Enterprise AI adoption began with solutions like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): chatbots and copilots that surface rapid insights. Yet many business processes demand more than answers—they require agents able to execute multi-step actions (like submitting forms or orchestrating workflows) across complex systems. Traditional automation methods struggle to keep pace with enterprise needs at scale. Agentic AI offers a way forward.

## Core Patterns for Agentic AI in Enterprises

This post highlights five foundational design patterns enabling robust agentic automation:

### 1. Tool Use Pattern

- Agents go beyond providing advice—they interact directly with APIs, trigger workflows, and complete transactions.
- Real-world example: Fujitsu's sales proposal process uses specialized agents for data analysis, market research, and document assembly, reducing production time by 67%.

### 2. Reflection Pattern

- Agents assess and refine their outputs autonomously, minimizing errors.
- Particularly important in compliance and finance scenarios.
- Even code assistants like GitHub Copilot leverage internal review loops prior to output.

### 3. Planning Pattern

- Planning agents break complex goals into actionable tasks, adapting as requirements change.
- Example: ContraForce automates security incident response with agents decomposing each incident into phases and dynamically progressing through them, automating 80% of incident workflows.

### 4. Multi-Agent Pattern

- Enterprises benefit from networks of specialized agents, orchestrated to operate in parallel or sequence.
- BAQA Genie, deployed by JM Family, uses multiple agents (for requirements, coding, QA) coordinated by an orchestrator, speeding product development lifecycle and QA by up to 60%.

### 5. ReAct (Reason + Act) Pattern

- Enables adaptive, real-time problem solving where agents alternate between reasoning and acting, adjusting strategies dynamically.
- Useful in IT support scenarios for real-time diagnostics and escalation.

These patterns can be combined, building automation solutions that are agile, auditable, and ready for real-world complexities.

## The Value of a Unified Agent Platform

Building agents for production involves real engineering challenges: chaining steps, securing data access, ensuring observability, and orchestrating at scale. Teams often develop custom scaffolding for these needs—slowing outcomes and increasing risk.

### Azure AI Foundry: A Cohesive Platform for Agentic AI

Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry addresses these gaps with an end-to-end platform:

- **Prototype locally, deploy at scale**: Seamless migration from local experimentation to cloud runtime.
- **Flexible model access**: Unified API for Azure OpenAI, xAI Grok, Mistral, Meta, and 10,000+ open models, with dynamic model routing and leaderboards.
- **Modular agent architectures**: Compose and connect specialized agents and patterns, replicating successful structures across teams.
- **Enterprise connectivity**: 1,400+ built-in connectors support integration with systems like SharePoint, Bing, SaaS, and business apps.
- **Open protocols**: Support for Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables interoperability across clouds and partners.
- **Enterprise-grade security**: Managed Entra Agent IDs, role-based access control, "on behalf of" authentication, and rigorous policy enforcement.
- **Deep visibility**: Advanced observability with step-level tracing, Azure Monitor integration, and automated evaluation—supporting compliance needs and continuous improvement.
