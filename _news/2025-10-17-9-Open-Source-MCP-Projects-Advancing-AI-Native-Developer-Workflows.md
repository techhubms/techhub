# 9 Open Source MCP Projects Advancing AI-Native Developer Workflows

*By Kevin Crosby*

The rise of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is enabling groundbreaking ways for AI and software agents to interact with code, tools, and real-world applications. To drive further innovation, the GitHub Copilot and VS Code teams, working with Microsoft’s Open Source Program Office (OSPO), have sponsored nine cutting-edge open source MCP projects.

These community-driven projects fall into three main categories, each contributing to AI-first developer experiences:

## 1. Framework and Platform Integrations

Projects in this category make it easier to integrate MCP capabilities into popular development frameworks and environments, unlocking AI-native tooling for real-world use cases:

- **[fastapi_mcp](https://github.com/tadata-org/fastapi_mcp):** Quickly expose secure FastAPI endpoints as MCP tools with simple setup and unified infrastructure.
- **[nuxt-mcp](https://github.com/antfu/nuxt-mcp):** Provides Nuxt developer tools for route inspection and SSR debugging, helping your AI models better understand your Vite/Nuxt applications.
- **[unity-mcp](https://github.com/CoplayDev/unity-mcp):** Bridges Unity game engine APIs with MCP, allowing AI tools to manage assets, automate scenes, edit scripts, and streamline game development workflows.

## 2. Developer Experience and AI-Enhanced Coding

These projects empower LLMs and agents to act as intelligent IDE assistants, simplifying developer workflows, enhancing semantic code understanding, and supporting safe code execution:

- **[context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7):** Provides LLMs and agents with current, version-specific documentation and code snippets sourced directly from your codebase for richer context.
- **[serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena):** Agent toolkit for semantic code retrieval and editing, bringing advanced search and modification to coding agents.
- **[Peekaboo](https://github.com/steipete/Peekaboo):** Analyzes Swift code on screen to generate AI context and enable full GUI automation, powering assistant tools.
- **[coderunner](https://github.com/instavm/coderunner):** Transforms LLMs into instant code execution partners, providing sandboxed runtime environments that read files, auto-install tools, and return detailed outputs and artifacts.

## 3. Automation, Testing, and Orchestration

This segment enhances MCP’s production readiness, enabling scalable automation, streamlined testing, and reliable infrastructure:

- **[n8n-mcp](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp):** Deepens MCP's integration into workflow automation, simplifying orchestration for users and leveraging AI models to work efficiently with n8n nodes.
- **[inspector](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector):** A comprehensive tool for MCP server testing and debugging, featuring prompt inspection, OAuth flows, an LLM playground, and evaluation simulation for quality assurance and security.

## Next Steps

AI-native and agentic workflows are accelerating development at an unprecedented pace. These projects, supported by GitHub Copilot, VS Code, and OSPO, represent important advances in the MCP and open source ecosystem, providing robust tools for developers pushing the boundaries of what AI can do in programming environments.
