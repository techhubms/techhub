stclarke summarizes Microsoft’s launch of the Agent Framework, a new enterprise-focused AI orchestration tool within Azure AI Foundry, designed for building and scaling multi-agent systems.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Microsoft Agent Framework Powers Multi-Agent Systems in Azure AI Foundry

The announcement spotlights Microsoft’s newest push in enterprise AI: the Microsoft Agent Framework. This technology enables organizations to build, orchestrate, and scale multi-agent AI systems directly in Azure AI Foundry. By leveraging efficient token management and high-performance agent frameworks, Microsoft aims to drive tangible enterprise outcomes from AI deployments.

## Key Features

- **Build and orchestrate multi-agent systems:** The framework provides tools and infrastructure within Azure AI Foundry to develop agentic applications at scale.
- **Enterprise foundations:** Combines the AutoGen runtime for agent execution with Semantic Kernel, providing out-of-the-box compliance and observability features.
- **Deep Azure integration:** Easily deploy, scale, and manage your agentic AI solutions within the Azure ecosystem.

## Why It Matters

- **AI Economics:** Focuses on efficiency, cost-management (token factories), and performance for real-world enterprise implementation.
- **Enterprise-ready:** Includes native compliance, observability, and secure integration—crucial for production adoption.

## What Developers Can Do

- Build autonomous, multi-agent solutions for complex workflows
- Use enterprise features for governance, compliance, and monitoring
- Scale agent systems with Azure-native infrastructure

## Related Technologies

- **AutoGen:** Microsoft’s agent runtime for managing agent execution.
- **Semantic Kernel:** Enterprise-grade orchestration features integrated with the Agent Framework.
