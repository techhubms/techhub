# Reviewing AI-Generated Code in .NET: Best Practices for Developers

Effective code review is crucial when integrating AI-generated code into .NET projects, especially as tools like GitHub Copilot become more common. Developers play a key role in ensuring that such contributions meet quality, reliability, and maintainability standards.

## Why Code Review Matters for AI-Generated Code

As AI tools accelerate feature delivery (with observed gains of 20–40%), diligent code review ensures long-term quality. Reviewers can catch edge cases, standard deviations, and architectural mismatches before they cause tech debt or maintenance headaches.

## Key Areas to Watch When Reviewing AI Code

### 1. API Design & Interface Architecture

- **Interface Abstraction:** AI may generate unnecessary interfaces. Check for simplicity.
- **Method Naming:** Ensure names meet project standards (e.g., consistent suffixes).
- **API Surface:** Limit exposed methods to what’s necessary.
- **Extension Methods:** Confirm builder patterns and extensions follow established conventions.

### 2. Testing & Testability

- **Unit Test Coverage:** Insist on comprehensive tests for all new public methods.
- **Test Quality:** Use precise assertions and prefer snapshot tests over generic ones.
- **Preserve Existing Tests:** Avoid needless changes to previously working tests.

### 3. File Organization & Architecture

- **Auto-generated Files:** Monitor for accidental edits to auto-generated files.
- **Layer Separation:** Validate logical placement of code (Infrastructure, Publishing, etc.).
- **Namespaces:** Ensure new additions are properly organized into assemblies.

### 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

- **Null Checking:** Enforce consistent patterns.
- **Exception Handling:** Prefer specific exception types over generic ones.
- **Edge Case Coverage:** Be vigilant for overlooked scenarios.

### 5. Configuration & Resource Management

- **Resource Lifecycle:** Confirm correct creation/disposal, especially for resources like Docker environments.
- **Configuration Patterns:** Adhere to standard callbacks and configuration approaches.
- **Environment Logic:** Check for appropriate branching paths (e.g., publish vs run).

### 6. Code Quality & Standards

- **Documentation:** Often missing in AI code—ensure public APIs are well-documented.
- **Styling:** Correct formatting or stylistic inconsistencies.
- **Performance:** Critically assess design choices that impact performance.

## Strategies for Reviewing AI-Generated Pull Requests

- **Iterative Review:** Expect more review cycles and incremental edits.
- **Architectural Guidance:** Provide strong feedback to align new code with existing designs.
- **Enforce Standards:** Insist on team conventions, not generic defaults.
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Focus on robust tests, maintainable code, and meaningful documentation.
- **Smaller PRs:** Encourage focused, manageable changes for easier review and integration.

## Conclusion: The Developer as an AI Code Reviewer

Stepping into the reviewer role for AI-generated code lets you uphold quality as your team adopts modern development tooling. By applying these strategies, you safeguard your codebase while unlocking the productivity that AI tools promise.
