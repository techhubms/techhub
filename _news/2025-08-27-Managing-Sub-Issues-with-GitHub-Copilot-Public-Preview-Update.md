Allison introduces an update to GitHub Copilot in public preview, enabling developers to create and manage sub-issues by chatting directly on github.com/copilot, streamlining project and issue organization.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Managing Sub-Issues with GitHub Copilot: Public Preview Update

GitHub Copilot continues to evolve with a new feature set in public preview, allowing developers to create sub-issues and manage hierarchical issue relationships via chat on [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot). This makes it easier to break down complex work, structure projects, and reduce manual coordination.

## What's New

Developers can now:

- **Create an issue with multiple sub-issues.** Useful for building out new epics or large features.
- **Add sub-issues to existing issues.** Helpful for decomposing complex issues into manageable parts.
- **Assign parent issues to existing issues.** Organize related issues under a single tracking parent.

## How to Get Started

1. Go to [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot).
2. Interact with Copilot using prompts such as:
    - "Create me a parent issue and sub-issues for [YOUR-IDEA-HERE]."
    - "Add a sub-issue to issue [YOUR-ISSUE-URL-HERE]."
    - "Break down [YOUR-ISSUE-URL-HERE] into sub-issues."
3. Review the proposed issues and their relationships within the chat interface.
4. Modify the issues by asking Copilot to add or remove sub-issues as needed.
5. Use **Review + Create** to generate all issues in one workflow.

## Helpful Tips

- Plan your issue structure ahead of time and specify it in your prompt so Copilot can make informed suggestions.
- After creating issues, you can continue managing relationships and adjusting structures without leaving the chat.
- Use the hierarchy view ("Parent:" dropdown) to easily see how issues relate before finalizing them.
- Paste links to existing issues as references for richer context when updating issue relationships.

## Additional Notes

- Features discussed are in public preview, and the UI may change based on feedback.
- Streamlining issue management allows developers to focus more on code rather than manual coordination.
