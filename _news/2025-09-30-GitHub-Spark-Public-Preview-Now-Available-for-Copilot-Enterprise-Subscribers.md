Allison introduces GitHub Spark, a new GitHub platform feature now in public preview for Copilot Enterprise subscribers, highlighting AI-driven rapid prototyping and team collaboration.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub Spark Public Preview for Copilot Enterprise Subscribers

GitHub Spark is a new solution designed to help organizations transform ideas into working software much faster. Currently in public preview, Spark is exclusively available to Copilot Enterprise customers.

## What Is GitHub Spark?

Spark is built directly into the GitHub platform, empowering teams—including developers, product managers, and designers—to collaborate around live application prototypes, reducing time spent on specs or static mockups. With Spark, the process from idea to production is streamlined:

- **Natural language to app:** Input your idea in natural language and Spark generates full-stack prototypes, including both frontend and backend logic.
- **Zero setup:** Out-of-the-box support for data management, large language model (LLM) inference, hosting, deployment, and GitHub authentication.
- **Integrated AI:** Built-in access to LLMs from providers such as OpenAI, Meta, DeepSeek, and xAI, enabling intelligent features in your apps without extra API management.
- **One-click deployment:** Publish and share applications securely with minimal effort.
- **Flexible building options:** Use a combination of natural language instructions, visual tools, or direct code edits assisted by GitHub Copilot completions.
- **Automated repository creation:** Every Spark project is linked to a full-featured repository, ensuring code and collaboration remain synchronized.
- **Copilot agent integration:** Open a Codespace directly from Spark to use Copilot's agent mode or assign coding tasks as issues to the Copilot coding agent.

## Enabling Spark in Your Enterprise

By default, Spark is disabled. Enterprise admins can enable it by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Enterprise Policies** in your GitHub admin dashboard.
2. Select **Copilot** from the sidebar.
3. Find the "Features" section and locate "Spark".
4. Set Spark to **Enabled** for all Copilot Enterprise users or apply more granular organizational settings.
5. Once enabled, eligible users can access Spark at [github.com/spark](https://github.com/spark).

Spark messages use premium requests within the existing Copilot plan.
