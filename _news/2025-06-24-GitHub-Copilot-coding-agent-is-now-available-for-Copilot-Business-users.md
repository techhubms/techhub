In this article, Allison discusses the recent public preview launch of GitHub Copilot's coding agent, aimed at users with Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise subscriptions. <!--excerpt_end--> The new feature allows developers to delegate coding tasks to Copilot, allowing it to work autonomously in the background. This enhancement is designed to improve productivity by letting users offload routine or time-consuming tasks to the AI-powered agent.

The Copilot coding agent leverages advanced artificial intelligence to interpret coding instructions and handle multi-step workflows. By implementing this background execution capability, teams and individuals can focus on higher-priority programming challenges while maintaining steady progress on delegated workstreams. Early feedback suggests that users value the increased flexibility and streamlined development experience.

The article outlines the prerequisites for accessing the Copilot coding agent, notably that it is available to Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise users during the public preview phase. Furthermore, Allison highlights the ongoing nature of the preview, encouraging users to participate and provide feedback, which will be essential for refining the service before a wider release. The summary concludes by noting GitHub's broader push toward integrating AI-driven tools into the software development lifecycle.
