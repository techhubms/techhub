# Azure SDK Release Highlights – October 2025

By Ronnie Geraghty

Stay up to date with the latest Azure SDK releases and improvements rolled out in October 2025. This summary covers key updates in AI, search, identity, and resource management across multiple programming languages, providing developers robust tools to enhance their solutions.

## Release Highlights

### Azure AI Foundry 1.0.0 for .NET

- First stable release of Azure AI Foundry library for .NET
- Enables developers to:
  - Create and run AI Agents
  - Manage AI model deployments
  - Handle connections to Azure resources
  - Upload documents and create datasets
  - Manage search indexes
- Notable improvements:
  - Consistent `AIProject` prefix for key models (`AIProjectDeployment`, `AIProjectConnection`, `AIProjectIndex`)
  - Simplified client access and new `CreateOrUpdate` methods for index management
  - Uses v1 AI Foundry data plane REST APIs and integrates secure authentication with Microsoft Entra ID

### Azure AI Search for JavaScript (12.2.0) and Python (11.6.0)

- Adds support for the `2025-09-01` service version
- New features:
  - Vector queries against sub-fields of complex fields
  - Reranker boosted scores and expanded sorting options
  - Improved vector compression configs
  - LexicalNormalizers for better text analysis
  - New `DocumentIntelligenceLayoutSkill` for richer skillsets
  - OneLake data source connections for indexers
  - For Python: `QueryDebugMode` for debugging vector search

### Azure Identity Libraries – Performance Improvements

- Managed identity scenarios optimized for these languages:
  - C++ (1.13.2), Go (1.13.0), Java (1.18.1), JavaScript (4.13.0), Python (1.25.1)
- Skips IMDS endpoint probe when `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` is set to `ManagedIdentityCredential`, using direct token acquisition with robust retry logic and exponential backoff
