# Windows ML Is Generally Available: Empowering Developers to Scale Local AI Across Windows Devices

**Author**: stclarke

## Overview

Microsoft announces that Windows ML, its built-in AI model inferencing runtime for Windows 11, is now generally available for production use. Windows ML allows developers to deploy, optimize, and manage AI models locally across a diverse array of Windows hardware, seamlessly supporting CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs from major silicon partners like AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, and Qualcomm.

### Key Capabilities

- **Local AI Inference**: Developers can run advanced AI workloads directly on Windows devices, increasing responsiveness, privacy, and cost-efficiency.
- **Cross-Hardware Support**: Windows ML integrates with CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs through execution providers (EPs), abstracting away hardware differences and enabling optimal performance.
- **ONNX Model Compatibility**: Developers can bring existing ONNX models or convert PyTorch models using the AI Toolkit for VS Code for straightforward deployment on Windows devices.
- **Streamlined Deployment**: Automatic detection and download of required execution providers reduce app size and complexity.
- **Silicon Partner Optimizations**: Deep integration with AMD (Ryzen AI), Intel (OpenVINO), NVIDIA (TensorRT for RTX), and Qualcomm (QNN EP for Snapdragon) to harness the strengths of each platform.

### Developer Tooling

- **AI Toolkit for VS Code**: Allows model conversion (e.g., PyTorch to ONNX), quantization, optimization, compilation, and evaluation—streamlining preparation and deployment.
- **AI Dev Gallery**: Offers an interactive workspace for experimenting with custom AI models and deployment scenarios.
- **Windows App SDK Integration**: Windows ML ships as part of the Windows App SDK (starting with v1.8.1) and supports all devices running Windows 11 24H2 or newer.

### Real-World Adoption

Leading software vendors are integrating Windows ML into their products:

- **Adobe (Premiere Pro, After Effects)**: Accelerated semantic search, tagging, and scene detection using local NPUs.
- **BUFFERZONE**: Real-time secure web page analysis, enhancing privacy and user protection.
- **Camo by Reincubate**: Real-time image segmentation and AI-powered video improvements.
- **Dot Vista by Dot Inc.**: Voice control and OCR for accessibility scenarios.
- **Wondershare Filmora**: AI-driven body effects and real-time previews.
- **McAfee**: Automatic deepfake detection and scam protection.
- **Topaz Photo**: AI-powered image enhancement for photography.

### Getting Started

To use Windows ML in production applications:

1. Update your project to the latest [Windows App SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/stable-channel#version-171-17250401001).
2. Use Windows ML APIs to initialize execution providers and load any ONNX model.
3. Reference guides, tutorials, and sample code:
