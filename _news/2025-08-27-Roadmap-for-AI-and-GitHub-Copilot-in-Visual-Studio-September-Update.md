# Roadmap for AI and GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio: September Update

**Author:** Rhea Patel  
**Source:** [Visual Studio Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/roadmap-for-ai-in-visual-studio-september/)

## Overview

Microsoft's Visual Studio team shares their September roadmap for advancing AI-powered, agent-driven experiences in the IDE. The focus is on making developer tools smarter, faster, and more intuitive with deep integration of GitHub Copilot, new agent-based debugger and profiler experiences, smarter code completions, and expanded support for customization and DevOps workflows.

## Key Roadmap Features

### 1. AI-Powered Debugging and Profiling

- **Profiler Agent and Debugger Agent:** New agentic tools leveraging AI to streamline debugging and profiling workflows. These integrate both built-in and extension-provided modes to handle more complex, context-driven coding scenarios.

### 2. Copilot Chat and Customization

- **Custom Modes for Copilot Chat:** Developers can tailor their workflow integrations and chat experiences within Visual Studio using improved customization features.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) in All Modes:** MCP enables advanced workflow support, including security, governance, prompt templates, resource handling, and sampling.

### 3. Enhanced Agent Mode & Chat

- **Performance & Feedback:** Faster code mapping across models, better progress indication, and agent mode as default for chat.
- **Expanded Functionality:** Running tests from chat, improved context retention with project memories, and support for instruction files.
- **User Control:** Options to disable built-in tools and redirect agent mode mid-response for enhanced control and flexibility.

### 4. Model Support and Bring Your Own Key

- **Latest Model Integrations:** Copilot now supports new models such as Claude Opus 4.1 and GPT-5 Mini, plus bring-your-own-key options for models like Azure Foundry and custom endpoints.

### 5. Deep DevOps Integration

- **Azure Agentic DevOps:** Agentic workflows combine with Azure and GitHub for streamlined build, deployment, and management. Features include:
  - Automatic Azure MCP installation (Public Preview)
  - 1P Azure MCP installation (planned for Visual Studio 2026)
  - CI/CD via GitHub Actions & Azure DevOps to Azure App Service for .NET
  - Custom modes for Azure developers

### 6. Editor and Productivity Enhancements

- **Copilot-Powered Code Completions:** Improved suggestion mechanisms, predictive edit suggestions, and new Copilot keyboard shortcuts.
- **All-In-One Search with Copilot:** Enhanced code search and action features powered by Copilot, including context menu integration.
