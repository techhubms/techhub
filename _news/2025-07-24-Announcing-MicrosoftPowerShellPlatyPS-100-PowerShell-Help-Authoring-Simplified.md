Authored by Jason Helmick and Sean Wheeler, this post introduces Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS 1.0.0, detailing the new capabilities and improvements for PowerShell help file authoring.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Announcing Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS 1.0.0

**Authors**: Jason Helmick, Sean Wheeler

Weâ€™re pleased to announce the general availability (GA) release of [Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS v1.0.0](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS).

### What is PlatyPS?

**PlatyPS** is a tool that Microsoft utilizes to generate PowerShell content available from `Get-Help` and to build documentation published on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting). Traditionally, PowerShell help files are stored using [Microsoft Assistance Markup Language (MAML)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Assistance_Markup_Language), an XML-based format. PlatyPS streamlines the authoring process by enabling users to write help files in [Markdown](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a format widely adopted across the software industry with support in numerous editors, including **Visual Studio Code**. Markdown files can be easily converted to MAML for help file consumption.

### Key Improvements in 1.0.0

- **Major Re-write in C#**: Leverages [markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) for Markdown parsing (the same library used by Microsoft Learn).
- **More Accurate Cmdlet Descriptions**: Provides richer details of PowerShell cmdlets and their parameters, including previously unavailable information.
- **Object Model for Help Files**: Enables manipulation and cmdlet chaining for complex documentation operations.
- **Improved Performance**: Processes thousands of Markdown files in seconds.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell 7+ across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Transition from Previous Versions

With this release, **Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS** is the officially supported tool. Older versions, such as **platyPS v0.14.2**, are no longer supported. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade. Note: Any scripts using the old version must be updated for compatibility with the new cmdlets.

### Getting Started

To install **Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS 1.0.0**, use the following command from PSGallery:

```powershell
Install-PSResource -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.PlatyPS
```
