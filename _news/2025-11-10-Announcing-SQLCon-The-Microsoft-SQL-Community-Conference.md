# Announcing SQLCon: The Microsoft SQL Community Conference

The SQL ecosystem is expanding rapidly through innovations in SQL Server, Azure SQL, and Microsoft Fabric. SQLCon is a dedicated conference for database professionals—including developers, database engineers, and administrators—to learn and engage deeply with these technologies.

## Major Themes at SQLCon

- **AI-Ready Databases:** Explore SQL Server 2025 and Azure SQL’s capabilities, featuring enterprise-grade vector database features, semantic search with DiskANN indexing, and extensible AI model management supporting models such as Azure OpenAI and Ollama.
- **Copilot Integration:** Discover how Copilot enhances SQL workflows with AI-powered T-SQL generation and troubleshooting in Azure SQL Database, and real-time coding suggestions via GitHub Copilot in SQL Server Management Studio 22 preview.
- **Modern Developer Features:** Deep dive into new developer capabilities—including native JSON data type, regular expressions, REST API support, and Change Event Streaming—bridging SQL with contemporary development platforms.
- **SQL in Fabric Integration:** Learn about seamless data deployment in Microsoft Fabric with SQL Database, GraphQL APIs, database mirroring, CI/CD, and real-time analytics, connecting SQL Server (2016-2025) and Azure SQL for hybrid workflows.
- **Hybrid Data Management:** Understand hybrid management using SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc, providing unified monitoring, automated updates, high availability, DR, secure backups, and modern cloud features for on-premises databases.
- **Security and Identity:** Sessions will cover advanced security features—such as database encryption, managed identities with Microsoft Entra, and data protection best practices—across SQL and Fabric.
