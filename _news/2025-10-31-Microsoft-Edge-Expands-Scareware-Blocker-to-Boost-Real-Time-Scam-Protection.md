# Protecting More Edge Users with Expanded Scareware Blocker Availability and Real-Time Protection

By stclarke

## Introduction

Microsoft Edge has rolled out its Scareware blocker as a default feature on most Windows and Mac devices. Using AI-powered computer vision models, the blocker proactively intercepts scam pages before users fall victim, extending protection far beyond what traditional threat intelligence can offer.

## How Scareware Blocker Works

- **Local Computer Vision Model**: The blocker uses an on-device AI model to detect scam tactics—including full-screen takeover scams—and takes action before these threats are recognized by global blocklists.
- **Lightweight Design**: The model operates on devices with more than 2 GB of RAM and at least four CPU cores, ensuring minimal impact on browsing performance.
- **Enterprise Controls**: IT professionals can manage the blocker using policy tools and allow-lists to customize protection for business environments.

## User-Driven Protection and Impact

- **Feedback Loop**: Users can manually report scams, feeding intelligence to Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.
- **Community Effect**: On average, each report results in 50 more users being protected by SmartScreen.
- **Broad Coverage**: Protection extends beyond typical 'virus alert' popups, defending users from a variety of scam types including fake system errors and fraudulent law enforcement impersonations.

## Integration with Microsoft Defender SmartScreen

- **Real-Time Sensing in Edge 142**: The new 'scareware sensor' feature in Edge enables instant reporting to SmartScreen when suspicious activity is detected.
- **Privacy Preserved**: Only minimal information is sent to SmartScreen (no screenshots or sensitive data); the setting is off by default and disabled in InPrivate mode.
- **Pipeline Improvements**: Microsoft is upgrading its backend pipeline, reducing the delay between a scam report and global protection roll-out.

## Technical Advancements and Community Thanks

- **Production-scale Intelligence**: The improved connection integrates Scareware blocker with production SmartScreen systems, accelerating global rollout of new scam blocks.
- **Community Contributions**: The collaborative effort involved community testers and feedback from tens of thousands of users, creating a stronger line of defense against attackers.

## What’s Next

As more anonymous detection signals are added and the protection pipeline continues to improve, exposure to new scams is expected to drop significantly. Feedback from the user community remains crucial to continual improvement.
