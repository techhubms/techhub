# Azure Developer CLI: Dev to Production with Azure DevOps Pipelines

*Authors: PuiChee (PC) Chan, Kristen Womack*

This article provides a thorough guide to building robust CI/CD pipelines using Azure Developer CLI (azd) together with Azure DevOps Pipelines. Following a 'build once, deploy everywhere' pattern, the guide covers configuring multi-stage pipelines, managing pipeline artifacts, implementing environment-specific infrastructure, and leveraging AI-powered tools for pipeline optimization.

## Key Highlights

- **Dev-to-Prod CI/CD Pattern**: Implements a pipeline where one build is promoted seamlessly across development and production environments using consistent infrastructure as code with Bicep templates.
- **Pipeline Structure**: Utilizes Azure DevOps YAML multi-stage pipelines (build and package, development deploy, production promote) with clear separation of concerns and improved traceability via pipeline artifacts.
- **Artifact Management**: Switches from simple local file backups to native pipeline artifacts for cross-stage compatibility, automatic cleanup, and better UI traceability.
- **Environment Configuration**: Relies on conditional Bicep deployment using `envType` parameters for environment-specific resource setup.
- **AI-Enhanced Pipelines**: Introduces GitHub Copilot for Azure and Azure MCP—AI assistants that help debug YAML, add validation, and automate best practices directly in VS Code.

## Sample Multi-Stage Pipeline Structure

```yaml
trigger:
  - main
pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
stages:
  - stage: build_and_test
  - stage: deploy_development
    dependsOn: build_and_test
  - stage: promote_to_Prod
    dependsOn: deploy_development
```

### Key Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Build and Package

- Installs Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), sets up authentication, builds, and packages code using azd.
- Publishes output as a pipeline artifact.

#### 2. Deploy to Development

- Provisions development infrastructure with Bicep via azd.
- Downloads pipeline artifact and deploys to the dev environment.

#### 3. Validation Gate

- Introduces manual or automated validation steps before production promotion (placeholder for health checks, security scans, integration, or performance tests).

#### 4. Promote to Production

- Uses environment variables to deploy the tested package to production, ensuring separation of dev/prod resources.

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Initialize Your Project**

   ```
   azd init -t https://github.com/puicchan/azd-dev-prod-appservice-storage
   ```

   Use a dev-focused environment name, e.g., `projazdo-dev`.

2. **Edit `azure.yaml`**
   - Set Azure DevOps as your pipeline provider.
   - Add required production variables: `AZURE_PROD_ENV_NAME`, `AZURE_PROD_ENV_TYPE`, `AZURE_PROD_LOCATION`, `AZURE_PROD_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`.

3. **Set Up Development Environment**

   ```
   azd up
   ```

4. **Set Up Production Environment**

   ```
   azd env new projazdo-prod
   azd env set AZURE_ENV_TYPE prod
   azd provision
   ```

5. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Switch between dev and prod, set pipeline-required environment variables, and validate deployments.

6. **Configure the CI/CD Pipeline**

   ```
   azd pipeline config
   ```

   - Monitor pipeline runs in Azure Pipelines.

## Using GitHub Copilot for Azure

By enabling GitHub Copilot for Azure in VS Code, you unlock:

- AI-driven diagnostics for YAML and configuration issues.
- Automatic suggestions for validation gates, approval steps, and deployment optimizations.
- Context-aware help by simply asking Copilot in the IDE—e.g., "Add a health check validation step".

## Conclusion

Whether leveraging GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps, the core logic—conditional infrastructure deployment, artifact promotion, and automation with azd—remains the same. Incorporating AI tooling like GitHub Copilot for Azure can further enhance productivity, error detection, and CI/CD pipeline resilience.
