Allison introduces Dependabot's new feature that automates updates for Rust toolchain versions, making it easier for Rust developers to maintain up-to-date CI environments across teams.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Dependabot Adds Support for Automated Rust Toolchain Updates

Dependabot now supports automatic updates for Rust toolchain versions defined in `rust-toolchain.toml` and `rust-toolchain` files. This enhancement helps maintainers and teams keep their Rust projects in sync with the latest stable, beta, or nightly toolchain releases, ensuring consistent developer and CI environments.

## What's New

Rust projects commonly use `rust-toolchain.toml` or `rust-toolchain` files to specify the toolchain version for predictable builds. With this update, Dependabot actively monitors these files and generates pull requests to update the toolchain version whenever a new version becomes available.

### Supported Update Patterns

- **Versioned toolchains**: For channels like `channel = "1.xx.yy"` or `channel = "1.xx"`.
- **Dated toolchains**: For nightly or beta releases, e.g., `channel = "nightly-YYYY-MM-DD"` or `channel = "beta-YYYY-MM-DD"`.

## Getting Started

To enable this feature, add a Rust toolchain update configuration to your `.github/dependabot.yml` file. Refer to the Dependabot options reference for example configurations and detailed settings.

## Additional Resources
