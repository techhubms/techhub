# Microsoft Sentinel Recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SIEM

Microsoft has been named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), reaffirming Microsoft Sentinel’s place at the forefront of cloud and AI-powered security operations. Microsoft Sentinel now offers organizations a unified, modern solution for advanced threat detection, real-time investigation, and automated response across hybrid environments.

## Cloud-Scale SIEM Analytics and Innovation

With the general availability of the Microsoft Sentinel data lake, organizations are empowered to centralize security data from over 350 sources. This centralized, cloud-native architecture breaks down data silos, enables long-term retention, and facilitates advanced analytics—all of which heighten threat visibility and detection accuracy.

Key features include:

- **SOC Optimization**: AI-driven recommendations improve coverage, reduce operational costs, and help security teams maximize cyberthreat detection and analytics efficiency.
- **Cost Management**: New features in preview support cost predictability, transparency, and efficiency.

## Advanced AI and Autonomous Security Operations

Microsoft Sentinel has integrated agentic AI and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, making security data ready for autonomous security agents. These innovations allow defenders to automate investigations, correlate complex signals, and respond at machine speed.

The platform supports:

- Real-time analytics through Kusto Query Language (KQL), Spark notebooks, and ML models
- Automation and orchestration to reduce manual workload for analysts
- Advanced UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics), anomaly detection, and threat intelligence powered by embedded AI

## Unified Security Platform and Cross-Platform Coverage

Microsoft Sentinel combines SIEM, SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response), UEBA, and threat intelligence in a seamless environment integrated with Microsoft Defender. This approach delivers:

- Comprehensive correlation algorithms utilizing behavioral analytics, machine learning, and real-time threat intelligence
- Customizable detection with MITRE ATT&CK® mapping
- Automated incident response and advanced hunting

## Strategic Roadmap and Community Engagement

Microsoft is investing in agentic AI, cost-effective data lakes, and cross-platform integrations to strengthen end-to-end security for modern SOC teams. The vision is to accelerate detection, enable smarter response, and build stronger resilience as cyberthreats evolve.
