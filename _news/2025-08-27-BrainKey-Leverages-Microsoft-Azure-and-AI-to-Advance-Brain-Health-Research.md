# BrainKey and Microsoft Azure: Advancing Brain Health Research with Responsible AI

## Introduction

BrainKey, a healthcare startup, is driving innovation in brain health through the integration of advanced AI models and Microsoft Azure's robust cloud services. Inspired by personal experience with difficult neurological diagnoses, BrainKey's mission is to empower both patients and physicians with early, accurate insights from medical imaging.

## How BrainKey Uses AI for Early Detection

- Utilizes proprietary AI to analyze MRI scans, identifying subtle changes in the brain that may indicate neurological issues before symptoms appear
- Employs models trained on large, diverse datasets to estimate 'brain age' and detect early signs of decline
- Offers a 3D visualization interface, enhancing patient and clinician understanding of brain scans

## Microsoft Azure: Powering Scalable, Secure Healthcare Solutions

- Infrastructure built on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/kubernetes-service) for scalable compute
- Uses Azure Blob Storage for secure, HIPAA-compliant data management
- Implements Terraform for flexible infrastructure provisioning and management
- Integrates with [Nuance PowerShare](https://www.nuance.com/healthcare.html), enhancing data sharing capabilities for healthcare providers

### Security and Compliance Focus

- Complete HIPAA compliance with encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Architecture supports privacy and healthcare regulatory requirements

## Support and Collaboration through Microsoft Ecosystem

- Joined [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups) in 2019, receiving technical credits, mentorship, and access to a global network
- Collaboration with Microsoft's Digital and Strategic Initiatives (DSI) team, optimizing technology stack and exploring go-to-market strategies
- Plans to launch BrainKey on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/) for broader healthcare adoption

## Preparing for Rapid Growth

- Recently signed with a major MRI provider in the US, positioning BrainKey for national scale
- Continues to build infrastructure to support a large user base and data-intensive workloads
- Emphasis on making brain health accessible and actionable for millions, supported by Microsoft’s global cloud footprint

## Conclusion

BrainKey exemplifies how responsible AI, combined with Azure's scalable and secure cloud platform, can transform brain health research and diagnostics. Their ongoing partnership with Microsoft accelerates healthcare innovation and broadens access for providers and patients alike.
