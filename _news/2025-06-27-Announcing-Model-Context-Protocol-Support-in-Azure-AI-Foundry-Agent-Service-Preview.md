# Announcing Model Context Protocol Support (Preview) in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

_By Linda Li_

Generative-AI agents only become useful when they can **do** things—such as querying systems of record, triggering workflows, or accessing specialized knowledge. Traditionally, achieving this integration required custom solutions: hand-rolling Azure Functions, managing OpenAPI specifications, or creating proprietary plugins for each backend system.

## Introducing MCP: Streamlining AI Agent Integration

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, an open, JSON-RPC–based protocol originally proposed by Anthropic, changes this paradigm. MCP allows a “server” to publish *tools* (i.e., functions) and *resources* (i.e., context) once. Any compliant “client,” such as your AI agent runtime, can then discover and call these tools and resources automatically—think of it as the "USB-C for AI integrations."

With the preview release, **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** has become a first-class MCP client. This means you can bring any remote MCP server—whether self-hosted or SaaS—and Azure AI Foundry will import its capabilities in seconds, keep them updated, and seamlessly route calls through the service's enterprise envelope.

> **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enables:
> - Developers, organizations, and service providers to host services and APIs on MCP servers.
> - Easy exposure and connection of tools to MCP-compatible clients (like Foundry Agent Service).
> - Automatic addition and update of actions and knowledge in agents as MCP server functionality evolves.

As a result, the process of building and maintaining powerful agents is significantly streamlined.

## Key Benefits with MCP Support in Foundry Agent Service

- **Easy integration with services and APIs**: Connect both internal and external services/APIs to Foundry Agent Service with MCP, removing the need to write or manage custom functions.
- **Enterprise-ready features**: Access capabilities such as Bring Your Own thread storage and other advanced options through the enterprise features built into Foundry Agent Service.

## Practical Example: Code Samples

The following hands-on Python code sample illustrates the integration process using the Azure AI Foundry SDK.

### Step 1: Import Required Packages

Use the latest versions for [azure-ai-projects](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-projects/1.0.0b12/) and [azure-ai-agents](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-agents/1.1.0b2/):

```python
import time
import json
from azure.ai.agents.models import MessageTextContent, ListSortOrder, McpTool
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
```

### Step 2: Create an AI Project Client and Foundry Agent

Assign a unique `server_label` for the MCP server; `server_url` points to the MCP endpoint. `allowed_tools` can be specified as needed.

```python
mcp_tool = McpTool(
    server_label=mcp_server_label,
    server_url=mcp_server_url,
    allowed_tools=[],  # Optional
)

project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=PROJECT_ENDPOINT,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential()
)

with project_client:
    agent = project_client.agents.create_agent(
        model=MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME,
        name="my-mcp-agent",
        instructions=(
            "You are a helpful assistant. Use the tools provided to answer the user's "
            "questions. Be sure to cite your sources."
        ),
        tools=mcp_tool.definitions
    )
    print(f"Created agent, agent ID: {agent.id}")
```

### Step 3: Create a Thread, Message, and Run

Within the run, you can pass custom headers and use your `server_label` to map to a specific MCP server.

```python
thread = project_client.agents.threads.create()
print(f"Created thread, thread ID: {thread.id}")

message = project_client.agents.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="<a question for your MCP server>"
)
print(f"Created message, message ID: {message.id}")
```

To provide headers:

```python
mcp_tool.update_headers("SuperSecret", "123456")
```

To create a run:

```python
run = project_client.agents.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    agent_id=agent.id
)
```

### Step 4: Execute the Run and Retrieve a Message

Use `run_step` for details on tool inputs/outputs. Tool calls to an MCP server require approval by default.

```python
while run.status in ["queued", "in_progress", "requires_action"]:
    time.sleep(1)
    run = agents_client.runs.get(thread_id=thread.id, run_id=run.id)

    if run.status == "requires_action" and isinstance(run.required_action, SubmitToolApprovalAction):
        tool_calls = run.required_action.submit_tool_approval.tool_calls
        if not tool_calls:
            print("No tool calls provided - cancelling run")
            agents_client.runs.cancel(thread_id=thread.id, run_id=run.id)
            break

        tool_approvals = []
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            if isinstance(tool_call, RequiredMcpToolCall):
                try:
                    print(f"Approving tool call: {tool_call}")
                    tool_approvals.append(
                        ToolApproval(
                            tool_call_id=tool_call.id,
                            approve=True,
                            headers=mcp_tool.headers,
                        )
                    )
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error approving tool_call {tool_call.id}: {e}")

        print(f"tool_approvals: {tool_approvals}")
        if tool_approvals:
            agents_client.runs.submit_tool_outputs(
                thread_id=thread.id,
                run_id=run.id,
                tool_approvals=tool_approvals
            )

    print(f"Current run status: {run.status}")

# Retrieve the generated response

messages = agents_client.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
print("\nConversation:")
print("-" * 50)
for msg in messages:
    if msg.text_messages:
        last_text = msg.text_messages[-1]
        print(f"{msg.role.upper()}: {last_text.text.value}")
print("-" * 50)
```

### Step 5: Clean Up

```python
project_client.agents.delete_agent(agent.id)
print(f"Deleted agent, agent ID: {agent.id}")
```

## MCP and Open-by-Design AI: Microsoft Build 2025 Announcement

At **Microsoft Build 2025**, Satya Nadella shared Microsoft's vision for an *open-by-design* AI ecosystem, announcing a partnership with **Anthropic** to make MCP a first-class standard across Windows 11, GitHub, Copilot Studio, and Azure AI Foundry.

Preview support for MCP in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is a major step, enabling “connect once, integrate anywhere” for cloud-hosted agents. Now, plugging an MCP server into Foundry can be accomplished without custom code.
