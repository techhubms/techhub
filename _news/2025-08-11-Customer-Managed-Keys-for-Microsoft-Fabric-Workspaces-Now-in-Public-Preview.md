# Customer-Managed Keys for Microsoft Fabric Workspaces Now in Public Preview

The Microsoft Fabric Blog team has announced that customer-managed keys (CMK) for Microsoft Fabric workspaces are now available in public preview across all public regions.

## Key Highlights

- **Global Availability**: CMK is now accessible in all public regions, following an earlier, more limited regional preview.
- **Enhanced Compliance**: Organizations can now use their own encryption keys instead of relying solely on Microsoft-managed keys (MMK), simplifying the process of meeting compliance and regulatory requirements.
- **Azure Managed HSM Support**: The release also adds compatibility with [Azure Managed Hardware Security Module (MHSM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/managed-hsm/overview), ensuring higher security standards and enabling dedicated hardware-level protection for stringent scenarios.
- **Comprehensive Guidance**: A [step-by-step guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/workspace-customer-managed-keys) is available for getting started with CMK in Fabric workspaces.

## Whatâ€™s New?

- **Flexible Encryption**: While Fabric encrypts all data at rest by default with MMK, CMK provides the option to use organization-controlled keys, supporting varying compliance needs.
- **Stronger Data Protection**: By leveraging Azure Managed HSM, organizations are able to achieve advanced data security and meet the requirements of strict regulatory environments.

## Getting Started

- For setup instructions, refer to the official [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/security/workspace-customer-managed-keys).
