# Enhance your CLI Testing Workflow with the New dotnet test

**Author:** Mariam Abdullah

The new .NET 10 update brings significant enhancements to the `dotnet test` command, targeting developers who need reliable test execution directly from the CLI. With the native integration of Microsoft.Testing.Platform (MTP), developers and DevOps engineers benefit from faster, more robust, and easier-to-diagnose test runs.

## Key Improvements in .NET 10

- **Native MTP Integration:**
  - MTP is now directly supported in `dotnet test`, replacing earlier reliance on VSTest.
  - Built-in configuration via a solution- or repository-level `dotnet.config` file.

- **Performance & Diagnostics:**
  - Faster test startup and discovery, especially noticeable in large solutions.
  - Structured logging and detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting.
  - Improved output formatting using ANSI terminal standards.

- **Streamlined Migration:**
  - Clear migration path from VSTest to MTP.
  - Legacy MSBuild properties for test configuration are deprecated.

## Usage Patterns and Examples

- **Basic Test Execution:**

  ```bash
  dotnet test
  ```

- **Target Specific Project or Solution:**

  ```bash
  dotnet test --project ./Path/To/Project.csproj
  dotnet test --solution ./Path/To/Solution.sln
  ```

- **Advanced Filtering:**
  - Leverage `--test-modules` for granular assembly selection and globbing patterns.

- **Parallel Execution:**

  ```bash
  dotnet test --max-parallel-test-modules 4
  ```

- **Output Control:**

  ```bash
  dotnet test --no-ansi
  dotnet test --no-progress
  dotnet test --output Detailed
  ```

- **MSBuild Integration Examples:**

  ```bash
  dotnet test -p:DefineConstants="DEV"
  dotnet test --property:Configuration=Release
  ```

## Migration & Compatibility Notes

- All test projects in a solution must migrate to MTP if enabling it via `dotnet.config`â€”mixed VSTest and MTP environments are not supported.
- Remove obsolete properties like `TestingPlatformDotnetTestSupport` and `TestingPlatformShowTestsFailure` during migration.

## Benefits for Devs and DevOps Teams

- Unified, future-oriented architecture for .NET testing
- Portable solution for local, CI pipeline, and editor-based workflows
- Better performance and enhanced diagnosis in continuous integration scenarios
