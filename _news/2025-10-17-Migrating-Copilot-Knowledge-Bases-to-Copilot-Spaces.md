Allison introduces the new Copilot Spaces feature on GitHub, offering a streamlined migration path for existing Copilot knowledge bases, with improved security, organizational management, and support for collaborative development workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Migrating Copilot Knowledge Bases to Copilot Spaces

With the upcoming sunset of Copilot knowledge bases on November 1, 2025, GitHub has launched Copilot Spaces, a new platform for managing and sharing organizational knowledge. Users can now easily migrate their legacy knowledge bases by selecting the **Convert to Space** button for each resource they wish to convert.

## Security by Design

- Each migrated knowledge base becomes an individual Copilot Space.
- Only organization admins have initial access, allowing for testing and secure management.
- Admins can promote Spaces to wider organizational access when ready, ensuring better control and compliance.

## How Teams Use Copilot Spaces

- **Code Generation:** Automate generation of code that adheres to team security, API, and documentation standards.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Centralize resources such as SQL/KQL queries, telemetry schemas, and best-practice authentication documentation.
- **Onboarding:** Fast-track new developers by providing instant access to curated project documentation and institutional knowledge.
- **Project Planning:** Centralize product requirement documents (PRDs) and key architectural decisions to streamline planning and issue creation.

## Getting Started

- **Try Copilot Spaces:** Visit [github.com/copilot/spaces](https://github.com/copilot/spaces?utm_source=changelog-source-product&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-spaces-launch-sep-2025), now available on github.com for all Copilot users.
- **Feedback:** Join the [community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/174462?utm_source=changelog-source-feedback-post&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-spaces-launch-sep-2025) or use the in-product **Give feedback** button.
- **Documentation:** Learn more at [Copilot Spaces Documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/context/spaces?utm_source=changelog-source-docs&amp;utm_campaign=copilot-spaces-launch-sep-2025).
- **Billing:** Copilot Spaces uses the same [billing model](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests) as Copilot Chat.

For those managing critical project and organizational knowledge on GitHub, Copilot Spaces offers a secure, collaborative, and structured way to centralize resources and streamline workflows.
