## Introducing the GitHub Podcast

**Author:** Abigail Cabunoc Mayes

The GitHub Podcast is a new show dedicated to exploring the stories, people, projects, and trends that define and advance the open source community on GitHub. The podcast dives into questions about what makes open source work, the motivations of contributors, and how projects evolve from initial commits to large-scale deployments.

### The Role of Open Source in Today’s Ecosystem

At GitHub, open source is seen as the foundation of future software innovation. In 2025, technologies ranging from AI agents to climate-tech dashboards are launched in public repositories, available for anyone to fork, remix, and improve. Supporting open source now goes beyond just code; it’s an investment in the global R&D engine.

### Meet the Hosting Team

The podcast is hosted by a rotating group of experienced open source contributors:

- [Cassidy Williams](https://github.com/cassidoo)
- [Kedasha Kerr](https://github.com/ladykerr)
- [Andrea Griffiths](https://github.com/andreagriffiths11)
- [Abby Cabunoc Mayes](https://github.com/abbycabs)

Each host brings a unique perspective drawn from community building, education, open science, and building in public. Episodes focus on current challenges and opportunities in open source, shared both from personal experience and through interviews with other contributors.

### Episode Highlights

The first episode introduces the hosts, their open source journeys, and what continues to inspire them. Topics include:

- The importance of beginner content amid a host of resources
- Cassidy's story of discovering a passion for code

They also spotlight notable open source projects:

- [Anime.JS](https://animejs.com/): a creative JavaScript animation library
- [Docs](https://docs.numerique.gouv.fr/home/): an open source document editor by French and German governments
- [CSS Zero](https://github.com/lazaronixon/css-zero): a frontend starter kit with no build required

### Programming & Upcoming Episodes

A new episode will be released every two weeks, sharing stories from across the open source ecosystem. Topics range from tools, standards, and joyful (and sometimes chaotic) side projects, to guest interviews. Notable guests include Jason Lengstorf (developer-focused media) and Keeley Hammond (Electron core maintainer).

The next episode will explore the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/about-mcp):

- What MCP is
- Its importance in making AI tools transparent and interoperable
- How MCP builds on the tradition of open standards for developers
