# How AI Power Users in Malaysia Achieve More with Microsoft 365 Copilot

*From procurement and learning and development, to tech operations, Microsoft 365 Copilot is helping Malaysians in the financial services sector reclaim focus, reduce digital overload, and unlock more meaningful work.*

Across various roles and functions, the workday is increasingly longer, more fragmented, and burdened by digital clutter. According to [new Microsoft telemetry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/breaking-down-infinite-workday), the average worker receives 117 emails and 153 chats daily, facing interruptions every 2 minutes. This environment leaves little space for deep, focused thinking.

**The Role of AI in Streamlining Workflows**

The article considers how AI could help employees prioritize, summarize lengthy reports or meeting notes, or draft clear communications in a fraction of the usual time, freeing up bandwidth for more meaningful and impactful work. Increasingly, AI power users in Malaysia are realizing these benefits as organizations adopt tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot to manage complex workflows.

Microsoft 365 Copilot is described as a “quiet force,” simplifying, accelerating, and reimagining how work is accomplished across knowledge worker roles.

## Reducing Digital Overload for Better Clarity

For people responsible for managing teams, programs, and plans, staying organized can be overwhelming. **Dr. Nurrul Iiyana**, talent development and engagement lead at Credit Guarantee Corporation Malaysia (CGC), shares:

> “I’ve been using Microsoft 365 Copilot for almost a year now. My work has become a lot more seamless and structured. I can keep sight of the bigger picture without getting overwhelmed by minor details.”

This aligns with the findings of the [2025 Work Trend Index](https://news.microsoft.com/en-my/2025/05/08/microsofts-2025-work-trend-index-malaysian-workforce-and-leadership-align-on-intelligent-agent-integration/#:~:text=Kuala%20Lumpur%2C%208%20May%202025,C%2Dsuite%20to%20frontline%20workers.), which reveals Malaysian employees are turning to AI for capabilities such as unlimited ideas, 24/7 availability, and machine-driven speed.

For leaders like Dr. Nurrul, Copilot serves as more than an assistant:“It’s a thinking partner that helps untangle complexity, clarify priorities, and empower informed decision-making.”

## Reclaiming Time from Repetitive Work

Building on Work Trend Index insights, there is a notable capacity gap: 83% of Malaysian workers lack sufficient time or energy to complete their work, though 61% of leaders expect higher productivity.

**Julia Choong**, Business Process Specialist at PayNet, notes,

> “We handle a lot of complex data and adhere to strict processes. It can be challenging to stay creative when routine tasks take up most of your day, but that’s exactly why finding smarter, more efficient ways to work is so rewarding.”

**Muhammad Shhaffieq** from Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB)’s Technology Department experiences similar issues.

> “Previously, I felt like I was constantly juggling – switching between tabs, searching across multiple platforms just to complete basic tasks. Now, with Microsoft 365 Copilot integrated into my workflow, everything feels much more seamless.”

With Copilot, both Julia and Shhaffieq utilize Copilot to manage the tedious aspects of their roles, allowing greater focus on high-value priorities. Shhaffieq reports that tasks like drafting documents, building slides, and summarizing emails now take minutes. Julia highlights the value of Copilot’s smart suggestions in PowerPoint, which allocate more time for strategic thinking and stakeholder engagement.

## Building Confidence Through Everyday AI Use

Given AI’s potential, many workers hesitate to leverage it—often unsure where to begin. The article highlights recommendations from AI power users:

- Start small, with routine tasks or minor projects
- Gradually build confidence through regular use

Julia remarks,

> “It might feel intimidating at first, but you can begin with routine tasks or small projects and gradually build confidence.”

Shhaffieq adds,

> “Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, you’ll realize AI isn’t just a tool — it truly becomes your Copilot.”

Dr. Nurrul concludes,

> “AI has helped me stay on top of things, and make smarter, faster decisions. It’s changed the way I work — and how I lead.”

As demands grow and hours remain limited, Malaysian workers are finding their advantage with Microsoft 365 Copilot, not only increasing productivity but transforming the workplace experience.
