# Copilot Diagnostics Toolset for .NET in Visual Studio

*By Harshada Hole*

Debugging and diagnosing performance issues in .NET applications is often challenging and time-consuming. The latest Copilot-powered diagnostics features in Visual Studio aim to make these tasks faster, more insightful, and less tedious by integrating AI-driven assistance directly into your workflow.

## Copilot Debugging Toolbox

### Breakpoint & Tracepoint Copilot Suggestions

- Copilot analyzes your debugging context and suggests tailored conditional breakpoints and tracepoint actions, reducing manual setup.
- [Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/debug-with-copilot?view=vs-2022#get-suggestions-with-conditional-breakpoints-and-tracepoints)

### Breakpoint Troubleshooting

- Instantly diagnose non-binding breakpoints with Copilot's step-by-step guidance on symbol mismatch, build issues, or optimization settings.

### IEnumerable Visualizer with Copilot-Assisted LINQ Queries

- Inspect large collections in a tabular view, and ask Copilot to create or improve LINQ queries using natural language prompts.
- [Tutorial](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugging-with-the-ai-powered-ienumerable-visualizer/)

### LINQ Query Hover with Copilot

- Hover over a LINQ statement while debugging to receive in-context explanations, performance highlights, and logic checks from Copilot.
- [Release Notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes?tabs=allfeatures#debugging--diagnostics)

### Exception Assistance with Copilot

- Copilot summarizes exceptions, diagnoses likely causes, and suggests code fixes—helping you quickly understand and resolve errors.

### Variable Analysis with Copilot

- Use Copilot within DataTips, Autos, or Locals to get AI-powered explanations for unexpected variable results, turning debugging into a detective process.
- [Deep Dive](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-powered-insights-streamlining-variable-analysis-with-github-copilot-in-visual-studio/)

### Return Value Analysis with Copilot

- View and validate inline method return values directly in the code view, with Copilot offering explanations for correctness and troubleshooting.
- [Feature Details](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-inline-return-values-simplify-debugging-in-visual-studio-2022/)

### Parallel Stacks Deadlock Analysis

- Copilot automatically summarizes thread states in complex async/multithreaded debugging scenarios, providing deadlock and hang insights directly in the Parallel Stacks window.
- [In-Depth Guide](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/make-more-sense-of-multithreaded-debugging/)

## Copilot Profiling Toolbox

### Auto Insights: CPU Usage, Instrumentation, and Memory Allocation

- Copilot's Auto Insights quickly point out CPU hotspots, expensive functions, and possible code bottlenecks.
- Actionable guidance for optimizing loops, minimizing allocations, and improving overall efficiency—all accessible with 'Ask Copilot' in the debugger.
- Instrumentation and .NET Allocation tools also benefit from Copilot's AI summaries and suggestions, such as identifying zero-length array allocations.
