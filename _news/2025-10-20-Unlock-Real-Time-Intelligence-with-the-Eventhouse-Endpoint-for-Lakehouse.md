# Unlock Real-Time Intelligence with the Eventhouse Endpoint for Lakehouse

The Eventhouse Endpoint is a new, powerful capability in Microsoft Fabric that gives users the ability to query Lakehouse tables with high speed and flexibility, unlocking real-time analytics on large data sets.

## Key Benefits

- **Instant Schema Synchronization**: Any changes to tables and schema are automatically reflected within seconds, eliminating manual configuration.
- **Optimized Querying**: Run fast, scalable analytical queries using familiar languages (KQL or SQL), plus leverage advanced features like Query Acceleration Policy (QAP) on external tables.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Carry out time-series analysis, anomaly detection, and even embed Python code for complex data processing within your queries.
- **Unified Data Experience**: Work with current and future source data through a mirrored schema in a dedicated KQL database, ensuring you always have an up-to-date analytical view.
- **Diverse Consumption Options**: Features like Copilot/NL2KQL, dashboards, embedded queries, and visual data exploration are all supported, providing flexible ways to extract value from your data.

## How to Enable

Enabling the Eventhouse Endpoint is as simple as a single click. Once enabled, a new Eventhouse branch appears, showing OneLake shortcuts with QAP tables—these are automatically synced for ready-to-query, high-performance analytics.

The Eventhouse branch is available:

- In the Lakehouse workspace ribbon menu
- In the OneLake catalog
- Soon: On the Lakehouse main page

## Use Cases

- Real-time operational intelligence
- Time-series analysis and anomaly detection for monitoring
- Embedding advanced analytics using Python
- Powering dashboards and interactive visualizations
