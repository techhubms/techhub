Allison reports on GitHub Enterprise Cloud updates enabling billing managers and enterprise owners to visualize metered license usage by organization, providing more accurate reporting and cost attribution.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Visualizing GitHub Enterprise Cloud Metered Usage by Organization

GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) will introduce improved metered usage reporting starting October 1, 2025. These updates allow enterprise owners and billing managers to see exactly which organization is billed for each GHEC license, enhancing transparency and simplifying cost attribution.

## What's Changing

- **Usage by Organization**: GHEC metered usage is now displayed in the 'Usage by organization' section on the *Billing and licensing > Overview* page. Previously, this usage was rolled up as 'All other orgs.'
- **Metered Usage Attribution**: On the *Metered usage* page, reports now group GHEC metered usage by organization, instead of listing it as 'All other.'
- **Improved Billing Reports**: The organization column in metered billing usage reports now shows data for GHEC usage, adding clarity to billing data.
- **Usage API Enhancements**: The API now includes organization names for GHEC license usage.
- **Cost Center Attribution**: When organizations are linked to cost centers, GHEC metered usage is automatically assigned, improving financial tracking and reporting.

## Additional Notes

- For users associated with multiple organizations in an enterprise, the oldest organization will be used for attribution.
- The changes are effective for usage starting October 1, 2025. Historical data prior to this will not be updated or backfilled.
