# General Availability of Network Security Perimeter for Azure Monitor

**Author:** Mahesh Sundaram

Azure has officially released the Network Security Perimeter feature for Azure Monitor, offering customers a powerful tool for securing their monitoring infrastructures. This milestone enables Azure users to define trusted network boundaries around monitoring resources such as Log Analytics workspaces and Application Insights, blocking unauthorized public access by default.

## What is Network Security Perimeter?

Network Security Perimeter (NSP) is a network isolation feature for Azure PaaS services. It creates a trusted, restricted boundary—acting as a virtual firewall at the Azure service level—around monitoring resources. Public network access is denied by default, and only explicitly authorized traffic can communicate with resources inside the perimeter.

- Azure Monitor components (Log Analytics, Application Insights) communicate only within set perimeters.
- NSP prevents unwanted external connections and protects against data exfiltration.
- Intended for enterprises requiring strict network isolation for compliance (banking, government, healthcare).

## Why Is This Important?

Prior to NSP, while Private Link could secure traffic from VNets to Azure Monitor, certain endpoints remained exposed to the public internet. Now, with NSP,

- You can restrict Log Analytics and Application Insights to accept data only from specified sources (e.g., IP ranges or defined resources).
- Outbound communication is permitted only to authorized destinations.
- Any unauthorized access attempt is denied and logged for auditing.

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security & Data Protection:** Default block on external access, reducing unauthorized access and exfiltration risk.
- **Granular Access Control:** Fine-grained rules support restrictions by IP addresses, Azure subscriptions, or specific FQDNs.
- **Comprehensive Logging & Auditing:** Every rule-based connection attempt is logged, aiding in auditing and compliance efforts.
- **Seamless Azure Monitor Integration:** NSP is built-into all major Azure Monitor workflows including alerts and automation.
- **Centralized Management:** Administrators manage network rules for multiple resources and subscriptions in a single place.
- **No-Compromise Isolation with Private Link:** NSP works alongside Private Link, providing an additional security layer through defense-in-depth strategies.

## Use Cases

- Creating zero-trust boundaries for monitoring data
- Satisfying regulatory requirements for network isolation
- Enhancing auditing and incident response with unified logs

## Getting Started

To configure Azure Monitor with Network Security Perimeter and learn more, refer to official Microsoft documentation:
