# Building AI Agents for Enterprise Data with Agent Mart Studio and Microsoft Fabric

**Coauthored by: Venu Amancha (Lucid Data Hub) and Roy Hasson (Microsoft)**

Lucid Data Hub has announced the integration of Agent Mart Studio with [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric), providing business users a no-code environment to build and deploy AI agents powered by their own enterprise data in [OneLake](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/onelake-overview). This enables organizations to automate complex business processes with adaptive, secure, and industry-tailored AI agents.

## Addressing Enterprise Data Challenges

- Traditional enterprise data workflows are bottlenecked by technical complexity and reliance on engineering or data science teams.
- Non-technical users are often unable to extract timely, actionable insights from their data.
- Lucid's integration leverages Microsoft Fabric and the open OneLake platform to democratize AI agent creation, making it accessible via Agent Mart Studio's drag-and-drop, no-code interface.

## Real-World Use Case: Retail Out-of-Stock Automation

**Scenario:**
A retail company faces challenges tracking and responding to out-of-stock items. Previously, manual tracking, cross-department coordination, and lag in reporting would delay response.

**Solution with Agent Mart Studio:**

- Business analysts can use Agent Mart Studio in Fabric to automate out-of-stock detection and replenishment reporting, acting directly on near-real-time data from OneLake.
- Agents identify at-risk products, generate recommendations, and notify teams or trigger ordering actions—all without coding.
- Agents are customizable to match inventory policies, alert thresholds, and business rules per organization.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Building an Out-of-Stock AI Agent

### 1. Add the Agent Mart Studio Workload

- From Microsoft Fabric, add Agent Mart Studio to your Workspace(s). This unlocks the AI Agent Builder app.

### 2. Design Your Agent

- Launch Agent Mart Studio and use the visual interface to define business logic (e.g., notifying teams, triggering replenishments, or adjusting promotions).
- Add a new 'AI Agent' item and define its purpose, such as monitoring availability and triggering supplier recommendations.
- Select data tools: Agent Mart scans OneLake data and offers query blocks (e.g., inventory summary, sales, thresholds).
- Choose and customize business logic flows via provided templates. Extend with SQL or Python notebooks for advanced analysis or use LLMs for narrative reporting.
- Select actions: Send alerts (email, Teams), update Power BI dashboards, or invoke external services. Multiple parallel actions are supported.

### *Optional*: Prepare Contextual Data

- With Lucid Context Hub, users can model and annotate datasets in a Lakehouse, enabling quicker agent setup for large or complex enterprises.

### 3. Deploy and Test the Agent

- Activate the agent and choose built-in actions (e.g., updating dashboards, sending supplier reports, triggering restocks).
- Test using sample data and monitor results through Agent Mart Studio’s dashboards.
- Iterate quickly—refine replenishment rules and workflows based on real-time results.

### 4. Publish and Operate

- Publish your agent to make it live.
- Schedule or run agents on-demand, monitor execution logs, and deliver insights directly to business teams.

## Key Benefits

- **Empower Business Users:** Lowers technical barriers so business analysts can build and use sophisticated AI agents.
- **Automation and Adaptability:** Supports workflow automation across industries with customizable logic and secure, contextual guardrails.
- **Responsiveness:** Enables organizations to react faster using real-time data and automated actions, without lengthy engineering cycles.
- **Integration:** Works natively with Microsoft Fabric, OneLake, and can trigger actions in other Microsoft tools such as Power BI and Teams.
