## Fabric Platform Enhancements

### Domain Tags

- Supports organizing data into domains and sub-domains, with new capabilities allowing each domain to define and apply its own tags for business-specific contexts. This aids discoverability and governance.
- Tags can be configured by tenants or admins and make searching and filtering content by domain more effective.

### Updated Default Category in OneLake Catalog

- OneLake catalog introduces dynamic default category assignment based on user roles:
    - Power BI users default to the 'Insights' category for analytics and visualization tools.
    - Fabric users default to the 'Data' category for raw and structured data assets.
- User selections are preserved across sessions for a smoother experience.

---

## Data Science Features

### Fabric Data Agent Integration with Microsoft Copilot Studio

- Fabric data agents, which are AI-powered assistants for enterprise data synthesis and policy enforcement, can now be integrated with Copilot Studio.
- This enables organizations to build, deploy, and scale intelligent agents that work across trusted data sources, fostering agent-to-agent collaboration and richer user interactions within business chat scenarios.

### Data Source Instructions

- Fabric Data Agents now support data source-specific instructions, allowing users to guide AI behavior regarding query formulation, filtering, and dataset joins.
- This increases precision and relevance in responses, especially in environments with complex schemas.

### Streaming Results in Fabric Data Agent

- Data Agent now supports streaming incremental query results, displaying live updates as queries are processed, thus reducing wait times and providing transparency for troubleshooting.

### Improved Run Execution Flow for Data Agent

- Enhanced visualizations and step nomenclature for each phase of a Data Agent operation, streamlining understanding and troubleshooting.

---

## Real-Time Intelligence

### Simplified Rule and Object Creation

- Improved workflows for creating and grouping rules, reducing complexity in tracking and alerting on data events at both event and object levels.

### Send Alerts to Teams Groups and Channels

- Activator extends the ability to send automated Teams alerts not just to individuals but to group chats and channels, enhancing workflow integration and collaboration.

### Pass Parameter Values to Fabric Items (Preview)

- Activator can now pass both static and dynamic parameter values to triggered pipelines and notebooks, making events-driven automation richer and more adaptable.

---

## Data Factory Enhancements

### Incremental Copy in Copy Jobs (Generally Available)

- Incremental copy functionality is now GA, supporting more resource-efficient data movement by syncing only changes between runs, reducing processing and costs.

### Upsert Data to More Destinations

- Copy jobs can now upsert (merge) directly into Fabric Lakehouse, Salesforce, Dataverse, Dynamics 365/CRM, and Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL).

### Expanded Connectors

- New source/destination connectors include SFTP, FTP, IBM Db2, Oracle Cloud Storage, Azure AI Search, and many more.

### Copy from On-Premises to Data Warehouses

- Copy jobs now natively support copying data from on-premises data stores directly into Snowflake and Fabric Data Warehouse using staging in OneLake.

### Manual Control of Auto-Refresh in Pipelines

- Users can now disable or enable auto-refresh of output and monitoring views in pipeline activities, allowing easier exploration of lengthy activity lists.

---

## Mirroring Improvements

### Azure SQL Database Mirroring (Firewall Support, GA)

- Now generally available with support for network security via VNet Data Gateway and On-Premises Data Gateway. Enables secure mirroring of Azure SQL Databases behind firewalls.

### Improved Resume Process for Mirrored Databases

- When Fabric capacity is resumed, mirrored databases accurately show their 'Paused' status and allow manual resume, maintaining data integrity across interruptions.

### UI Option for Retention Period

- The UI now supports direct configuration of mirrored data retention periods, offering more flexibility over data lifecycle management.

---

## Database Updates

### Cosmos DB (NoSQL) in Fabric (Preview)

- Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL) is now available in preview for Microsoft Fabric, enabling direct integration and real-time analytics on globally distributed NoSQL data within Lakehouses, Notebooks, and Power BI.
- This reduces ETL workload and supports development of AI-driven applications on a unified platform.
