# GitHub Organization Owners Gain Control Over App Installations

GitHub has introduced a new setting giving organization owners the ability to block repository administrators from installing GitHub Apps on their own repositories. This update focuses on strengthening governance and reducing the risk of unauthorized or unexpected installations within organizations.

Previously, any user with admin permissions on a repository—including outside collaborators—could install GitHub Apps that required only repository-level permissions. This posed governance and security challenges, especially for organizations needing strict compliance.

## Key Benefits

- **Governance:** Ensures only trusted users (organization owners) can approve or install apps.
- **Security:** Reduces risk of unauthorized or unexpected app installations.
- **Compliance:** Helps organizations meet strict compliance requirements by limiting app installation powers.

## How To Use The Setting

- Organization owners can go to **Settings** > **Member privileges** and locate the new option under **GitHub Apps**.
- Enabling the setting means only owners, not repository admins, may install GitHub Apps across repositories.
- Repository admins will need to request an installation from an owner.

## Additional Notes

- This setting is now generally available for all organizations.
- For feedback, users are encouraged to join the [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/178756).
