Allison explains GitHub's new incremental analysis for CodeQL, enabling faster and more efficient security scans across all supported languages, including C#, in pull requests.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Incremental Security Analysis with CodeQL Now Available Across All Languages

GitHub has announced the availability of incremental analysis for CodeQL across all supported languages, including Go, C#, C/C++, and Swift. This update applies to CodeQL scans performed on pull requests, where only the code that is new or changed is analyzed during the evaluation step. As a result, developers benefit from improved scan speeds and quicker feedback without sacrificing the thoroughness of security checks.

## Key Improvements

- **Incremental Analysis for All Languages**: Now, every CodeQL-supported language, including C#, benefits from the incremental scan mode. This accelerates security reviews on pull requests.
- **Performance Gains**:
  - C# and C/C++ evaluations are around 5% faster.
  - Go evaluations are approximately 20% faster, with some scans showing over 40% improvement compared to full project scans.
- **Comparison Basis**: These improvements are achieved by comparing the time spent on pull request scans (incremental) versus scheduled runs that analyze the entire codebase.

## Availability

- Incremental analysis is enabled by default on [github.com](https://github.com).
- The feature will become available for [CodeQL CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli) users in the future.
- On GitHub Enterprise Server, incremental analysis support begins with version 3.19.

## Background and Reporting Changes

- Recent changes to how CodeQL processes and reports data were already applied to all supported languages during the earlier release of incremental analysis.
- No further reporting or processing modifications are introduced in this update.

## Why This Matters

This release completes the first stage of GitHubâ€™s plan to optimize CodeQL scanning speed and developer experience, offering faster feedback loops while upholding the quality of security assessments relied upon by many teams.
