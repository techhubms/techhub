stclarke reports on the Queensland Department of Families, Seniors, Disability Services and Child Safety's journey to transform cybersecurity using Microsoft 365 E5, enhancing protection for vulnerable communities and streamlining compliance through a unified Microsoft cloud platform.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Transforming Cybersecurity in Queensland Government: A Unified Microsoft Approach

The Department of Families, Seniors, Disability Services and Child Safety in Queensland, Australia, is responsible for a range of essential community services, including child protection, elder abuse prevention, accommodation for persons with disabilities, and supporting carers. Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of their work—ranging from child safety case notes to domestic violence records—the department faces extensive cybersecurity threats and compliance requirements.

## Challenging Legacy Security, Embracing Microsoft 365 E5

Recognising the growing risks, including those associated with generative AI and evolving technologies, and in line with government mandates to comply with the ASD Essential Eight, the department decided to fundamentally rework its security posture. The upgrade to the Microsoft 365 E5 license enabled the organization to replace a patchwork of legacy tools with an integrated Microsoft ecosystem, maximizing both protection and operational efficiency.

## Microsoft Defender XDR Suite Deployment

The department implemented the full suite of Microsoft Defender XDR products:

- **Defender for Endpoint**: Secured server and desktop infrastructure, with mobile devices beginning rollout.
- **Defender for Cloud, Identity, and Office 365**: Provided security for hybrid infrastructure, identity management, and collaborative tools.
- **Windows Defender Application Control**: Ensured compliance with Australia’s Essential Eight framework.

The Microsoft Defender portal and Secure Score became critical in tracking improvements and empowering distributed teams to address risks at scale.

## Microsoft Sentinel: Centralizing Security Ops

Migration to Microsoft Sentinel unified security information and event management across 140+ department locations. Automated incident response, integrated telemetry, and a streamlined interface helped a small team efficiently manage and triage alerts. Integration with Defender solutions allowed for continuous improvement and unified visibility.

## Holistic Security, Built-In Improvements, and Zero Trust

The technology worked "out of the box," accelerating security outcomes compared to the complex customisation of legacy platforms. Ongoing collaboration with Microsoft ensured a rapid rollout of new features and best practices. The department continues to extend security capabilities, looking to Microsoft Purview for advanced Data Loss Prevention as AI adoption increases and working to embed Zero Trust principles.

## Summary of Key Benefits

- **Consolidation**: Unified security tools under Microsoft 365 E5, reducing complexity and risk.
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Enhanced with Defender Secure Score and Sentinel's analytics.
- **Automation**: Automated incident response and integration streamline security workflows.
- **Strategic Partner Alignment**: Ongoing partnership with Microsoft ensures future-proofing against evolving threats.
- **Compliance and Zero Trust**: Alignment with ASD Essential Eight and pursuit of Zero Trust security models using Microsoft's latest tools.

This transformation ensures robust protection of sensitive data, efficient operation across distributed teams, and continuous improvement in an ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
