# GitHub Copilot in VS Code July 2025 Release (v1.103)

Allison provides an overview of the July 2025 GitHub Copilot update for Visual Studio Code (v1.103), which introduces several key improvements aimed at making AI-assisted coding workflows more reliable and productive.

## Highlights

- **Chat Checkpoints and Edit Workflow**: Developers can now restore previous workspace states and chat histories using chat checkpoints or edit previous requests inline, allowing for fine-tuning and efficient iteration.
- **UI Improvements to Enhance Focus**: The release features a revamped tool picker called Quick Tree for easier enabling of agent tools and a personalized model picker for customizing visible AI models in the UI.
- **Reliable Terminal and Task Interactions**:
  - Run-in-terminal and task tools are now built-in to VS Code core, reducing issues with hanging terminals.
  - Shell-integration warnings and consolidated terminal auto-approve settings improve safety.
  - Output polling helps with tracking long-running tasks for better observability.

## Experimental & Preview Features

- **Task Lists in Agent Mode**: Experimental support for visible to-do lists maintained by Copilot agents within chat, enabling tracking of multi-step coding plans.
- **Tool Grouping for Large Toolsets**: When the number of Copilot agent tools exceeds the allowed threshold, tools can be grouped, making it possible for a single request to utilize many tools efficiently.
- **Dedicated Coding Agent Sessions & Chat Sessions View**: Manage ongoing Copilot agent sessions in dedicated chat editors or a specialized Chat Sessions view to easily track progress and interact with long-running code generation workflows.
