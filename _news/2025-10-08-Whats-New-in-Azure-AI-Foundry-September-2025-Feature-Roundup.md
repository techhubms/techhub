# What‚Äôs New in Azure AI Foundry | September 2025

**Author:** Nick Brady

The September 2025 Azure AI Foundry update delivers significant model, tooling, and developer experience enhancements. Here‚Äôs a technical walkthrough of key changes, including major GA announcements, preview features, SDK updates, and new documentation resources.

## üß† Models

- **GPT-5-Codex (GA):** Multimodal code reasoning and advanced repo intelligence directly in Azure AI Foundry. Enables deep architecture refactor suggestions, staged migration flows, and performance/security code review. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/announcing-gpt%E2%80%915%E2%80%91codex-redefining-developer-experience-in-azure-ai-foundry/4455524)
- **Sora (Preview):** Video-to-video model accepts input clips and natural language instructions, returning temporally coherent, styled output. Abrupt content, high-res and sensitive scenarios capped during preview. [Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/video-generation-quickstart)
- **gpt-realtime (GA):** Unified speech-to-speech model collapses prior audio reasoning pipelines for ultra-low-latency, multimodal dialog and code collaboration.
- **Grok 4 Fast models (Preview):** Parallel function calling, long context support (131K tokens), and structured output schema for agentic orchestration. Designed for speed and deterministic routing.
- **o4-mini RFT (GA):** Reward-driven optimization using explicit grading logic, now in production (no longer only SFT required). [Announcement](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/o4-mini-reinforcement-fine-tuning-rft-now-generally-available-on-azure-ai-foundr/4452597)
- **Foundry Local v0.7:** Expanded NPU support on Windows and dynamic execution provider detection, enabling seamless hybrid local-cloud apps.
- **Avatar 4K + Emotion:** High-fidelity avatar rendering and synchronized emotion control for accessible, expressive agent applications.

## ü§ñ Agents & Tools

- **Browser Automation / Computer Use (Preview):** Resilient DOM automation and new pixel-level UI workflows. Critical for legacy app automation where semantic access is limited.
- **Microsoft Agent Framework (OSS):** Open-source orchestration for agents, offering Semantic Kernel durability, A2A messaging, YAML/JSON agent specs, OpenTelemetry, and enterprise-ready hooks. [Explore the framework](https://aka.ms/AgentFramework)
- **Evaluation & Safety:** `azure-ai-evaluation` 1.11.0 adds structured experiment tags, groundedness checks, enhanced red teaming, and multilingual categories for better model safety testing.
- **Azure AI Search‚ÄîKnowledge Sources:** Unified abstraction over content indexes and blob sources with integrated vectorization and answer synthesis, improving multi-source retrieval and latency transparency.

## üîê Platform & Security

- **Key Vault Connections:** Direct native secret management (no more inline secrets) for improved data security and rotational best practices.
- **Identity SDKs:** Across major languages, now enforce environmental variables and clarify claims challenges, reducing misconfiguration and onboarding friction.

## üåê Language & Data Services

- **Translator API (Preview):** Seamlessly brings neural translation to agent and multimodal workflows, supporting real-time chat, batch translation, terminology compliance, and scalable localization.
- **Text Analytics 6.0.0b1:** Next-gen analytics surface with expanded data flows.

## üíª SDK and Language Updates

Includes extensive highlights for:

- **Python:** New agent tools, evaluation and search enhancements, identity improvements, Cosmos DB optimizations.
- **.NET:** AOT compatibility, agent tool streaming support, knowledge source refactor in Search, improved identity options, storage and Synapse overhauls.
- **Java:** Search knowledge sources, Cosmos throughput and encryption, call automation features, and unified core dependency upgrades.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** OpenTelemetry updates, improved communication automation, Cosmos reliability, Playwright package migration, and TS HTTP runtime enhancements.

## üìù Documentation Updates

- **New Guides:** Announcements, how-tos, security, deployment, orchestration, region expansion, cost management, retirement timelines, and privacy notes.
- **Updated Docs:** Major rewrite for models, Sora, Grok, RFT, function calling, RBAC/Entra, network security, and more.
- **Platform Changes:** Unified cost and usage dashboards, region and quota expansions, new playgrounds, SDK migration notes, and BCDR best practices for agents.
