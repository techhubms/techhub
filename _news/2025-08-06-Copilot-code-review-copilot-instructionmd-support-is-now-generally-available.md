# Copilot Code Review: copilot-instructions.md Support is Now Generally Available

GitHub has announced that the ability to use a `copilot-instructions.md` file to customize Copilot code review is now generally available to all users. Previously, this feature was limited to a public preview, but now any developer can add a `copilot-instructions.md` file to their repository and write natural language instructions to tailor how Copilot assists with code reviews.

## How It Works

- Add a `copilot-instructions.md` file to your repository.
- Write instructions in natural language to guide Copilot's behavior during code reviews.
- These instructions help customize the code review workflow, letting Copilot understand project-specific standards or guidelines.

If you already participated in the public preview, no changes are required — the feature remains available, but is now open to everyone.

## Feedback & Improvements
