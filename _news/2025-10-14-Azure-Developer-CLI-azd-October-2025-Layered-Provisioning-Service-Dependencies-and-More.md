# Azure Developer CLI (azd) ‚Äì October 2025 Release Notes

_**Author:** PuiChee (PC) Chan_

The October 2025 update for the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) brings two major releases‚Äî1.19.0 and 1.20.0‚Äîpacked with new features, community-powered templates, and important enhancements for Azure-centric application development and DevOps workflows.

## üéâ What‚Äôs New

### Layered Provisioning Support (Alpha)

- **Layered provisioning:** Define infrastructure dependencies using layers in `azure.yaml` for granular control over sequential or parallel deployments.
- Provision, refresh, or clean up individual infrastructure layers using azd commands. This shift ensures you can use Bicep end-to-end as IaC, reducing reliance on custom scripts.
- [See PR #5492](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5492)

### Service Dependencies and Automatic Deployment Ordering

- **Service dependencies:** Use the new `uses` property in `azure.yaml` (1.20.0) to declare and orchestrate deployment order across services, automating complex dependency graphs.
- azd manages ordering and validation for you. [See PR #5856](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5856)

### New `azd publish` Command

- Separates container image publishing from app deployment, offering more flexible workflows.
- Supports Azure Container Registry, third-party registries, and both local/remote builds.
- Enhanced support for pre/post-publish hooks and integration with Azure Container Apps/AKS.
- `azd deploy` now supports more deployment scenarios with `--from-package` for direct image deployments.
- Customizable workflows are possible by redefining steps in `azure.yaml`.
- [See PR #5663](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5663)

### Extension Management Improvements

- Auto-install, beta APIs, custom service targets, and UX upgrades for system extensions.
- MCP server capability enables better AI integration scenarios.

### Advanced Development Features

- Container App Jobs for .NET Aspire, Bicep container app revisions, and custom language support extend developer toolchains.
- Optional shell attributes streamline workflow hooks across platforms.

### Authentication Enhancements

- Device-code flow improvements with enhanced claims support.
- Better guidance for service principal creation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

- **Deployment logging readability**
- **CloudShell telemetry tracking**
- **Warning message clarity**
- **Extension registry streamlining**
- **Preflight error handling and Aspire improvements**

## ‚ö° Dependency and Ecosystem Updates

- Go 1.25.0, Bicep CLI 0.38.33, and the latest GitHub CLI for up-to-date DevOps tooling.
- Schema improvements and clearer Redis provisioning signals.

## üìö New Documentation

- Updated metadata documentation: [Azure Developer CLI Metadata Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/metadata)

## üöÄ New Community Templates

- **A2A Translation Service:** Azure Container Apps, Storage Queues, AI Translator
- **FastMCP with Azure OpenAI:** Minimal AI integration experience
- **Architecture Document Generator:** AI Foundry agents, MCP service validation
- **Durable Functions Fan-Out/Fan-In:** Secure, scalable sample with Managed Identity
- **Network-hardened Web App:** Alignment with AZ-500/AZ-104 certifications
- **AI Foundry Agent Service:** Deep Research using Azure AI and Bing
- **Agentic/Data Foundation Solutions:** Microsoft Fabric, Semantic Kernel, unified data architecture
