Allison details GitHub's removal of notifications triggered by mentions in commit messages, explaining how this change aims to reduce spam and streamline developer workflow.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Removing Notifications for @mentions in Commit Messages

GitHub is making a change to help reduce spam notifications and allow users to focus on what really matters. Starting December 8th, notifications will no longer be triggered when a user or team is mentioned (@username or @team) in a commit message.

Previously, mentioning someone in a commit message resulted in a notification just like mentions in issues or pull requests. From now on, only mentions in issues, pull requests, and discussions will continue to generate notifications.

## Summary of the Changes

- **Prior behavior:** Mentions in commit messages triggered notifications.
- **New behavior:** Mentions in commit messages **will not** trigger notifications. Issues, pull requests, and discussion mentions remain unchanged.
- **Effective date:** December 8th.

## Why This Matters

This update helps cut down on spam and unwanted notifications, making it easier for developers and teams to track only the most relevant conversations and updates within their repositories.
