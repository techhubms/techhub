# GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Now Generally Available

GitHub has announced that the Copilot coding agent is now generally available for all paid Copilot subscribers. This asynchronous, autonomous developer agent allows subscribers to delegate a variety of software development tasks directly to Copilot.

## Key Features

- **Automated Development Workflow:**
  - Delegate tasks to Copilot and it will create a draft pull request in a separate development environment using GitHub Actions.
  - Copilot can manage tasks such as implementing new features, fixing bugs, addressing technical debt, improving test coverage, and updating documentation.

- **Collaboration:**
  - Once the Copilot agent completes a task, it requests a review from the user.
  - Developers can ask Copilot to make further changes via pull request comments, facilitating an iterative workflow.

- **Integration Points:**
  - Tasks can be handed over to Copilot in several ways:
    - Assigning issues in GitHub
    - Using the agents panel (available on every GitHub page)
    - The "Delegate to coding agent" button in Visual Studio Code

- **Enterprise & Business Usage:**
  - For Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise subscribers, administrators must enable the coding agent via the Policies page.

- **Adoption:**
  - Since public preview in May, the Copilot coding agent has been used to open over a million pull requests.
