# Transforming Scientific Discovery with Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA

Scientific innovation is entering a new era, powered by Microsoft Azure's cloud services and NVIDIA's GPU acceleration. This article highlights how startups and organizations from diverse sectors are using these technologies as catalysts for groundbreaking advances in science, healthcare, and content creation.

## Accelerating AI Adoption Across Industries

A majority of organizations are now adopting AI to transform business operations. In fact, 78% of companies report using AI in at least one business function. Startups leveraging AI are experiencing significantly faster access to funding. The need to innovate has driven these organizations to experiment with new products and services, with AI acting as a key driver of change and progress.

## The Catalyst Series: Startups Leading the Way

Season 1 of the Catalyst series presents three startups that exemplify how Microsoft Azure’s infrastructure and NVIDIA's AI technologies are reshaping the landscape of scientific discovery.

### Pangaea Data: Bridging Gaps in Healthcare with AI

Pangaea Data tackles the challenge of diagnosing and treating complex health conditions by applying AI to clinical guidelines and electronic health records. Their solution:

- Automates the review of digital patient records
- Identifies under-treated and hard-to-diagnose conditions
- Integrates into existing clinical workflows

**Impact:**

- In the UK’s NHS, Pangaea’s platform identified six times more untreated patients with cancer cachexia
- A US health system reported $9 million in additional revenue by closing care gaps for just one condition
- Runs on Microsoft Azure's globally compliant cloud infrastructure, ensuring secure, scalable, and reliable operations, and is integrated with NVIDIA’s AI stack

**Quote:**
> "The fact that [Azure] have already done the groundwork to be compliant across all different countries and territories... instills confidence that you are a trusted entity beyond just the technology." — Vibhor Gupta, PhD, Founder and CEO of Pangaea Data

### Basecamp Research: Enabling Breakthroughs in Biotechnology

Basecamp Research manages one of the largest biological databases, supporting research in drug discovery, protein engineering, and biological exploration by:

- Aggregating over 10 billion novel proteins
- Training AI models such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling using Microsoft Azure resources
- Utilizing NVIDIA’s BioNeMo framework for AI model training
- Leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and container registry for large-scale data annotation pipelines

**Quote:**
> "We’ve been leveraging Azure for this... to massively scale these annotation pipelines. NVIDIA comes in at the model training stage." — Glen Gowers, Co-Founder of Basecamp Research

### Global Objects: Digitizing the Physical World with AI

Global Objects combines AI with 3D scanning to create high-fidelity digital twins for a wide range of applications, including:

- Art preservation
- Film production
- Product development for gaming, robotics, and healthcare

Their process relies heavily on Azure and NVIDIA’s GPU-powered infrastructure to process large datasets quickly and deliver authentic digital replicas efficiently and reliably.

**Quote:**
> "The relationship with Microsoft and NVIDIA is so powerful... ensuring we always have uptime and can deliver with speed, efficiency, and fidelity." — Jesse Redniss, Chief Strategy Officer of Global Objects

## Conclusion: Empowering Innovation Through the Cloud

Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA are providing organizations with the scalable, high-performance computing and trusted infrastructure needed to push the boundaries of AI and ML in science and industry. These collaborations drive progress in fields such as healthcare, biotechnology, and digital content creation, laying the foundation for a more intelligent and inclusive future.
