# How Microsoft Is Advancing AI-Driven Clean Energy in Asia

The integration of AI with energy systems is reshaping the landscape of economic development, productivity, and sustainability across Asia-Pacific. With surging electricity demand and rapid digital infrastructure growth, Microsoft is taking a leading role in ensuring that progress is aligned with climate goals and resource resilience.

## Scaling Clean Energy and Sustainability Solutions

Microsoft is:

- **Signing long-term agreements for carbon-free electricity** and rolling out technologies such as AI-powered grid forecasting and circular datacenter practices, which make energy systems more efficient and sustainable.
- **Partnering with governments, utilities, and industry associations** to drive policy reform and enable faster deployment of renewables and infrastructure improvements.

### Key Initiatives

- **Expanding Clean Energy Supply and Market Development**
  - Microsoft has contracted more than 34 GW of carbon-free electricity globally, with 19 GW in 2024 alone, and is applying this model in Asia-Pacific for new projects.
  - Projects include a 20-year virtual PPA with Shizen Energy in Japan, rooftop solar with EDP Renewables in Singapore, and geothermal energy agreements in New Zealand.
  - The Climate Innovation Fund supports projects like Eversource Capital and SEACEF, both of which are accelerating clean energy investment and deployment in the region.

- **Supporting Policies and Advanced AI Technologies**
  - Advocacy has led to policy changes such as Korea's Special Act on Expanding the National Power Grid, making renewable integration and access for corporate buyers easier.
  - Microsoft partners in Asia are deploying AI platforms using Azure to improve solar and wind energy forecasting, increasing reliability and operational efficiency for renewables.

- **Strengthening Water Resilience**
  - Water scarcity and stress are urgent challenges. Microsoft is investing in rainwater harvesting and purification in schools (CLEAN International in Malaysia), enhancing conservation (FluxGen, Botanical Water in India), and supporting wetland creation (K-Water in Korea) to support communities and datacenter operations.

- **Advancing Circularity**
  - Initiatives like Singapore's Circular Center enable the reuse and recycling of decommissioned cloud hardware. Partnerships with companies like Cyclic Materials recycle rare earth magnets, reducing new mining activities and supporting sustainable supply chains.

## Technology and Impact

AI and Microsoft Azure are central to these advancements, from intelligent grid forecasting to efficient and resilient cloud datacenters. By combining technical innovation with strategic investments and policy advocacy, Microsoft aims to drive a large-scale transition to clean and sustainable digital infrastructure across Asia.
