In this article, Allison discusses new updates to GitHub Copilot, specifically focusing on changes to its internet access during the public preview phase. The updates aim to better protect user data and address potential security concerns, offering developers a safer and more secure experience while using Copilot.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary of Article

### Overview

Allison's article highlights recent changes to GitHub Copilot's coding agent during its public preview. The primary focus is on Copilot's default restriction to limited internet access. This measure is designed to enhance user data protection and reduce the risk of security breaches.

### Key Points

- **Internet Access Restriction**: By default, Copilot coding agents have limited ability to access the internet. This minimizes the likelihood of sensitive data exposure or unintended data sharing.
- **Security Risk Mitigation**: Restricting internet access helps address concerns about potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited within development environments.
- **Updated User Experience**: GitHub has released an updated experience (specifics not detailed in the excerpt) intended to make these protections more efficient or user-friendly.

### Impact for Developers

The update aims to safeguard codebases while allowing users to benefit from Copilotâ€™s AI features. Developers can expect Copilot to better align with organizational security policies during its public preview phase.

### Conclusion

The article underscores GitHub's commitment to evolving its AI-powered coding tools to balance usability with robust security measures.
