# Remote GitHub MCP Server Now Generally Available

The GitHub MCP (Machine-Centric Programming) Server has reached general availability, bringing a host of new features designed to strengthen developer workflows, boost automation, and enhance security in GitHub environments.

## Key Improvements & Updates

### üîê OAuth-Based Production Authentication

- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE Support:** Integrated with major IDEs (VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, Eclipse, Xcode, Cursor).
- **More Secure Alternative to PATs:** Offers automatic token refresh and short-lived credentials.
- **Centralized MCP Access Policy:** One policy manages MCP access across all Copilot environments. The previous "Copilot editor preview policy" no longer controls this setting.

### üöÄ Premium, AI-Powered Tools

- **Copilot Coding Agent:** Enables autonomous development tasks for MCP workflows‚Äîautomatically fixing bugs, implementing features, creating branches, running tests, and opening pull requests without manual intervention.
- **Secret Scanning with Push Protection:** Now standard for all public repositories to detect and block secrets in tool call inputs. Soon, this will extend to private GHAS-enabled repos.
- **Integrated Code Scanning Alerts:** Seamless access to security findings and early vulnerability detection in development pipelines.

### üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Workflow & Collaboration Tools

- **Security Advisories:** Granular support at organization, repository, and global levels.
- **Sub-Issue Management:** Add, list, remove, and reprioritize tasks within issues.
- **Pull Request Workflow:** Features like draft toggling and improved reviewer requests.
- **Gists & Discussions:** Improved support for collaborative and knowledge-sharing features.
- **Session & Pagination:** Advanced controls for managing sessions and large data sets.

## Why It Matters

The MCP Server empowers AI-powered assistants (like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or Cursor) to interact directly with developers' GitHub data and automate key workflows. By reducing context switching, it allows agents to search repositories, manage issues, review pull requests, and more‚Äîdriving productivity for developer teams.
