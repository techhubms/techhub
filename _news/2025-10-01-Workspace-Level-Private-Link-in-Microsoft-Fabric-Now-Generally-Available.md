# Workspace-Level Private Link in Microsoft Fabric: General Availability

Microsoft has announced the general availability of Fabric workspace-level Private Link, a feature designed to enhance security and connectivity within Microsoft Fabric environments.

## Key Features

- **Workspace-Level Private Link (GA):**
  - Allows setting up private connections to Fabric workspaces.
  - Supports finer-grained access control over Fabric artifacts.
  - Can be managed via both APIs and directly from the Fabric Portal.

- **Simplified Management:**
  - Enables seamless management and interaction with workspace artifacts.
  - Streamlines the process for building, managing, and collaborating within secure data experiences.

## How it Works

- **Enable Private Workspace Access:**
  - Users can now configure private access on a per-workspace basis.
  - Direct integration with the Fabric Portal means administrators and users can manage security preferences without complex configuration steps.
- **API Support:**
  - Organizations can automate setup and management of private links via API, supporting automated workflows and scaling.

## Security Benefits

- **Network Isolation:**
  - Private Links enable connecting over a private, secure Microsoft backbone network rather than exposing resources to the public internet.
- **Data Artifacts Protection:**
  - Improved control and visibility over who can access specific data artifacts within a Fabric workspace.
- **Governance:**
  - Supports enhanced data governance and regulatory compliance efforts.
