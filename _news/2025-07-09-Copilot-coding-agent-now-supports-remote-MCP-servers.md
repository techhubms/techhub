The article by Allison introduces the new functionality in GitHub Copilot's coding agent, focusing on the integration of remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. <!--excerpt_end--> This enhancement allows developers to configure and utilize remote MCP servers to significantly expand the agentâ€™s context beyond local environments. As a result, the Copilot coding agent is now better equipped to interact with diverse external systems, potentially improving productivity and code intelligence by leveraging broader data sources and environments. This update represents a meaningful step forward in making Copilot a more flexible and powerful AI-assisted development tool.
