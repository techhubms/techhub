# Deprecation of Claude Sonnet 3.5 in GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot will deprecate the Claude Sonnet 3.5 model across all Copilot experiences—including Copilot Chat, inline edits, ask and agent modes, and code completions—on **November 6th, 2025**.

## What Is Changing?

- Claude Sonnet 3.5 will no longer be available in any Copilot offering after the deprecation date.
- Newer, more capable AI models will be introduced for Copilot Free plan users to ensure an improved experience.

## What Should You Do?

- **Developers:** Update your workflows and integrations to use the supported AI models before November 6th, 2025.
- **Copilot Enterprise Administrators:**
  - Adjust model policies in Copilot settings to enable access to alternative models.
  - Check Copilot settings for available models; enabled models appear in the Copilot Chat model selector in VS Code and on github.com.
  - No manual removal is required for deprecated models; this will be handled automatically.
- **GitHub Enterprise Customers:** Direct questions or concerns to your GitHub account manager for assistance.
