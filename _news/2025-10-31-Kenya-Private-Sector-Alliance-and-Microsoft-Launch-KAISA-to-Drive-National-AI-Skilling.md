# Kenya Private Sector Alliance and Microsoft Launch KAISA to Drive National AI Skilling

The Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA), in partnership with Microsoft, has announced the launch of the Kenya Artificial Intelligence Skilling Alliance (KAISA). This national platform is designed to coordinate AI skills development, foster innovation, and facilitate policy collaboration across Kenya's key economic sectors.

## Background and Goals

With AI rapidly transforming global markets and Africa poised to gain up to USD 1.5 trillion by 2030 from increased AI adoption, KAISA aims to bridge Kenya's existing ecosystem fragmentation. By bringing together government, academia, private sector, and development partners, the initiative hopes to align training with industry needs, promote ethical AI, and broaden access to opportunities for youth, women, and marginalized groups.

## Strategic Focus Areas

- **Coordination of AI Initiatives:** KAISA will provide a coordinated national framework connecting skills, policy, and innovation.
- **Skills Development:** The platform will curate digital literacy to advanced AI training programs, targeting both existing workforces and the next generation.
- **Inclusivity:** A key focus is on job creation and social transformation, ensuring marginalized groups are not left behind.
- **Sector-Based Approach:** Working groups will guide AI adoption in key industries such as agriculture, health, education, finance, and manufacturing.
- **Policy and Ethics:** KAISA will promote ethical AI deployment, policy engagement, and the creation of responsible governance frameworks.

## Microsoft and KEPSA Collaboration

Microsoft's ongoing digital skilling programs in Kenya serve as the foundation for the broader KAISA initiative. Through this new alliance, the partners will expand curriculum development, innovation incubation, and research collaborations. Microsoft advocates deliberate investment in skill development as essential for realizing Kenya’s ambition to become Africa’s AI talent hub.

## Stakeholder Engagement

During the launch, leaders emphasized Kenya’s opportunity to become a creator and innovator within the global AI ecosystem. The event featured:

- Dr. Ehud Gachugu (KEPSA), underscoring the importance of preparing a future-ready workforce.
- Phyllis Migwi (Microsoft, Kenya), highlighting the need for both technical innovation and people skills.
- Ambassador Phillip Thigo (Government of Kenya), who called for AI adoption to be inclusive, ethical, and focused on building local capacity.
- Ms. Caroline Njuki (ILO, Kenya), advocating for decent work, fairness, and productivity through AI.
- Mr. Somanna Palacanda (Microsoft Elevate Skills) and others discussing applied research and innovation pipelines.

## Roadmap

KAISA’s first 24 months will focus on:

- Creating sector-focused working groups
- Launching national skilling programs
- Developing an AI repository and innovation hub
- Promoting research, policy collaboration, and ethical governance

## Join the Alliance

KEPSA and Microsoft are inviting government, academia, private sector, and development organizations to collaborate through KAISA to help shape Kenya’s digital future. More information is available at [KAISA’s Landing page](https://aiskillingalliance.ke/).

## Conclusion

The establishment of KAISA is a significant milestone in Kenya’s journey toward leveraging Artificial Intelligence for productivity, innovation, and inclusive growth. By fostering coordinated efforts and inclusive participation, Kenya aims to serve as a continental model for responsible, scalable, and human-centered AI development.
