# GitHub App for Teams Now in Public Preview

**Author:** sbaynes

The reimagined GitHub app for Microsoft Teams is now in public preview, bringing GitHub Copilot’s AI-driven coding capabilities directly into your Teams conversations. This AI-powered integration makes collaboration effortless by translating conversational discussions into code, automating pull requests, and accelerating your team's development workflows within familiar tools.

## Key Features

- **Copilot Coding Agent:** Built to understand your repository, translate chat into code, and automate tasks like opening pull requests and writing code.
- **Task Automation:** Assign issues to the app, which then writes code, opens PRs, and seeks code reviews—reducing manual work and oversight.
- **Repo Awareness:** The app analyzes your GitHub repositories, leverages code search, and respects organizational policies such as branch protection and human reviews.
- **Seamless Integration:** Operates natively within both GitHub and Teams, so developers can collaborate and manage tasks without leaving their preferred environment.

## Example Workflow

The GitHub app for Teams supports the full software development lifecycle:

1. **Identify bugs:** Support engineers or developers report bugs directly in Teams channels.
2. **Investigate issues:** Developers discuss the root causes and add context from logs and diagnostics within the conversation.
3. **Action planning:** Solutions and next steps are agreed upon collaboratively.
4. **Automate with GitHub:** Mention **@GitHub** to have the app generate necessary code changes and open pull requests.
5. **Track progress:** The app shares updates and keeps everyone informed through the resolution of issues, all within Teams.

## Getting Started

- [Install the GitHub app for Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/836ecc9e-6dca-4696-a2e9-15e252cd3f31) from Microsoft Teams.
- After installing, connect your GitHub account, set the default repository, and use **@GitHub** for conversational collaboration.
- The app is in public preview—feedback is welcome! [Join the Copilot conversations](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations) to share your thoughts.
- The previous GitHub for Teams app is now called [GitHub Notifications](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/wa200002077?tab=overview), focusing on notifications and workflow updates.

## Summary

The GitHub app for Teams bridges the gap between code and conversation, allowing developer teams to:

- Assign, automate, and review coding tasks in a single place
- Benefit from repository-aware AI assistance
- Move faster from discussion to delivery

Happy coding!
