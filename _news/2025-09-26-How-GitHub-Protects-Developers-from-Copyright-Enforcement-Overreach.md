# How GitHub Protects Developers from Copyright Enforcement Overreach

**Author**: Margaret Tucker

## GitHub's Approach to Copyright Takedowns

GitHub takes a developer-first stance when handling copyright takedowns, differing from some platforms that use automatic “three strikes” account bans. Every takedown case is reviewed individually to avoid unjust blocking of accounts, especially since collaborative code reuse means a false-positive takedown can have far-reaching effects for open source developers and projects.

## Cox v. Sony: Why It Matters

A pending U.S. Supreme Court case, *Cox Communications v. Sony Music Entertainment*, could substantially affect how platforms like GitHub respond to copyright claims. The central question: under what circumstances can a platform be held liable for user-generated copyright infringement? Tech industry stakeholders (including Microsoft with GitHub) advocate for liability only in cases of "conscious, culpable conduct," not mere awareness.

These safe harbor protections (DMCA Section 512) are crucial for hosting and sharing code. Without them, platforms would be forced to over-remove content, endangering innovation and collaboration. GitHub receives hundreds of DMCA takedown requests monthly but also thousands of incomplete or inaccurate notices. Its published [DMCA Takedown Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy) and [DMCA repository](https://github.com/github/dmca) aim to balance copyright obligations and legitimate developer activity.

## Transparency Center Updates

To reinforce transparency:

- GitHub updated its [Transparency Center](https://transparencycenter.github.com/) with 2025 data and clarified how government takedowns are reported.
- Government takedown requests are now reported as a combined category in transparency reports.
- Processed takedowns are tracked separately by basis: local law vs. Terms of Service.
- Official government removal requests are published in the [gov-takedowns repository](https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns).
- Researchers are encouraged to provide feedback on reporting clarity through GitHub issues.

## Acceptable Use Policy Updates

GitHub is updating its [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), with a 30-day open comment period. Proposed policies specify provisions against Child Sexual Abuse Material, Terrorist & Violent Extremist Content, Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery, and misuse of Synthetic Media/AI Tools. Guidance aims to clarify enforcement, ensure compliance with international law, and address new technological risks, such as deepfakes.

## Commitment to Developers

GitHub remains committed to measured, transparent, and fair moderation practices, resisting policies that would harm open source collaboration. The platform will continue monitoring legal developments and invites the community to participate in policy discussions.
