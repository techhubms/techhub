# 5 Critical Generative AI Security Threats: Insights from Microsoft

**Author:** Microsoft Security Team

Generative AI is rapidly transforming cybersecurity—enabling defenders to accelerate threat detection and automate responses, while also giving attackers powerful new capabilities. Microsoft's 2025 Digital Threats Report highlights that nation-state actors are leveraging AI to advance phishing campaigns, translate malicious content, generate deepfakes, and automate adaptive malware to evade detection.

## Security Challenges as AI Adoption Grows

- **Cloud Vulnerabilities:** Generative AI models are often cloud-based, introducing new risks where attackers exploit weaknesses in apps, models, or infrastructure.
- **Data Exposure Risks:** The volume of data required for AI increases the risk of leakage and makes governance complex in large environments.
- **Unpredictable Model Behavior:** The same AI input may yield different outputs, making it challenging to anticipate and defend against prompt injections or agent abuse.

Organizations report high levels of concern around threats like prompt injection and data leakage as they build custom AI applications.

## The 5 Key AI Security Threats

Among the most significant threats addressed in the new Microsoft guide are:

1. **Poisoning Attacks:** Attackers manipulate training data to distort output and undermine model reliability.
2. **Evasion Attacks:** Techniques like obfuscation or jailbreak prompts bypass security filters to deliver harmful content.
3. **Prompt Injection Attacks:** Maliciously crafted prompts override instructions, causing the AI to act unpredictably or with malicious intent.
4. **Deepfakes & Phishing:** AI is used for generating highly convincing deceptive content.
5. **Automated, Adaptive Malware:** AI-based malware evolves in real time to avoid detection mechanisms.

## Unified Security with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

A proactive, unified approach is essential. Microsoft Defender for Cloud integrates posture management (CSPM), entitlement management (CIEM), and workload protection (CWPP) into a single cloud-native platform:

- Scans code repositories for misconfigurations
- Monitors container images for vulnerabilities
- Maps attack paths to sensitive assets
- Detects AI-specific risks—like jailbreaks, credential theft, and data leaks—in real time
- Leverages signals from Microsoft Threat Intelligence

These capabilities enable security teams to quickly detect, investigate, and remediate threats spanning both AI and cloud environments.

### Customer Perspective

> "Microsoft Defender for Cloud emerged as our natural choice for the first line of defense against AI-related threats. It meticulously evaluates the security of our Azure OpenAI deployments, monitors usage patterns, and promptly alerts us to potential threats..."
>
> —Subodh Patil, Principal Cyber Security Architect, Icertis

## Recommendations & Resources

- Evolve security strategies to address both cloud and AI-specific risks
- Use unified platforms for end-to-end visibility and risk mitigation
- Keep up to date with practical threat intelligence from [Microsoft Security Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/)
- Explore Microsoft's [guide to AI security threats](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-5-generative-ai-security-threats.html) and [Defender for Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/cloud-security/microsoft-defender-cloud)

**Stay prepared for rapid changes by adopting integrated security for your entire AI and cloud lifecycle.**
