# MauiReactor: An MVU Approach for .NET MAUI

*Guest author: [Adolfo Marinucci](https://github.com/adospace)*

MauiReactor is an open-source .NET library bringing the Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern, widely known from React and Elm, to the .NET MAUI ecosystem. It provides developers with a powerful alternative to the standard MVVM approach, focused on code-based UI, predictable state management, and productivity.

## Background & Motivation

- MauiReactor started as an experiment with Xamarin.Forms and evolved to a mature, auto-generated layer over .NET MAUI.
- The MVU pattern promotes immutable state and streamlined UI development entirely in C#—utilizing IDE features like IntelliSense, refactoring, and code analysis.
- Suitable for those comfortable with declarative approaches from frameworks like React Native and Flutter.

## MVU vs. MVVM in .NET MAUI

- While MVVM is the default in .NET MAUI, MauiReactor’s MVU approach reduces boilerplate and eliminates the need for value converters and command objects.
- Example of MVU syntax for a login button:

  ```csharp
  Button("Login")
    .IsEnabled(!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(State.FirstName) && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(State.LastName))
    .OnClicked(OnLogin)
  ```

- More flexible conditional UI and robust hot reload, retaining user input between iterations.

## Real-World Applications

- MauiReactor powers production systems at companies like [Real Time Research, Inc.](https://realtimeresearch.com), integrating field data collection, Microsoft Azure synchronization, and Power BI reporting.
- Example: A fish survey app with offline support, GPS integration, and barcode scanning.
- Reliable state management supports complex workflows and synchronization.

## Technical Features

### Hot Reload Implementation

- MVU architecture simplifies hot reload so state is preserved during code changes.
- Compatible with .NET CLI standard reload or the custom Reactor.Maui.HotReload tool.
- Works across Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows (emulator/real devices); supports Visual Studio, VS Code, and Rider.

### Code-Based UI & Theming

- All UI logic and structure are coded in C#, supporting XAML theming, or a C#-based style system.

  ```csharp
  public class AppTheme : Theme
  {
    protected override void OnApply()
    {
      LabelStyles.Default = _ => _
        .FontFamily("OpenSansRegular")
        .FontSize(FontNormal)
        .TextColor(Black);
    }
  }
  ```

### Data Binding & Conditional Rendering

- No more value converters: logic is written directly in code (e.g., `Label().IsVisible(!MyValue)`)
- Conditional rendering uses C# evaluation:

  ```csharp
  State.IsBusy ? ActivityIndicator() : null
  ```

### Readability & Testing

- Large views are split into components or render functions for maintainable, readable code.
- Framework-agnostic integration testing, including support for MSTest, XUnit, NUnit, etc.

### Performance

- Minimal use of reflection improves compatibility with Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, reducing startup time and runtime inefficiencies.
- Default to compiled pages, avoiding XAML parsing bottlenecks.
- Sample profiling project available for in-depth comparison.

### Integration

- Supports third-party controls (e.g. Syncfusion, Telerik, DevExpress) with source generators and simple wrappers.
- Example:

  ```csharp
  [Scaffold(typeof(Syncfusion.Maui.Buttons.ToggleButton))]
  partial class ToggleButton { }
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Install the template:

   ```bash
   dotnet new install Reactor.Maui.TemplatePack
   ```

2. Create a new project:

   ```bash
   dotnet new maui-reactor-startup -o my-new-project
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-android
   ```

## Conclusion

MauiReactor is an established, productive, and flexible alternative for .NET MAUI UI development, praised by developers for its simplicity and efficiency. Its community-driven evolution ensures ongoing improvements and integration capabilities, giving developers more options in cross-platform app architecture.
