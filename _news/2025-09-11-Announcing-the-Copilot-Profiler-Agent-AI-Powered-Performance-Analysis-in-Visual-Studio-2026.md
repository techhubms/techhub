# Announcing the Copilot Profiler Agent: AI-Powered Performance Analysis in Visual Studio 2026

**Author: Harshada Hole**

The Copilot Profiler Agent is now available in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. This AI-powered tool, integrated directly into Visual Studio and powered by GitHub Copilot, serves as a performance coach for developers tackling real-world, production-grade code.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Bottleneck Detection:** Quickly analyzes CPU usage, memory allocations, and runtime behavior to surface the most expensive performance bottlenecks in your code.
- **Actionable Feedback and Suggestions:** Offers concrete fix suggestions, generates or optimizes BenchmarkDotNet benchmarks, and guides you through applying improvements.
- **Guided Validation:** Validates performance fixes with before/after metrics, ensuring enhancements deliver real gains.
- **Conversational Assistance:** Interact with the Profiler Agent using Copilot Chat by tagging (`@profiler Why is my app slow?`) or using natural language queries.

## Real Code, Real Impact

Unlike other tools that excel on simple samples, the Profiler Agent’s true power lies in handling complex, production-critical projects. During testing, it was pointed at the top 100 open-source libraries and applications—such as CSVHelper, NLog, and Serilog. The results included:

- Discovery of hidden bottlenecks often missed by even experienced engineers
- Auto-generated benchmarks to ensure performance improvements are valid
- Tangible fixes, submitted as real pull requests to improve popular libraries

> _"Saw the YouTube video and it is almost magical. Amazing how it was able to recognize that multiple expression-compiles could be merged into a single expression-compile."_ – NLog Maintainer

## Developer Experiences: Microsoft Case Studies

Internal adoption across Microsoft teams yielded impressive outcomes. For example, a Principal Engineer recounts how the Profiler Agent guided them to a .NET language feature that optimized memory and execution time, even after consultation with other principal engineers failed to solve the issue:

> _"After several prompt iterations with the profiler agent, it nudged me toward the realization that .NET supports duck typing for foreach... Honestly, I’m not sure I would have figured this out on my own."_

## How to Get Started

- Download [Visual Studio 2026 Insiders](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/insiders/)
- Enable the Profiler Agent from the Copilot Chat tool menu
- Start asking questions (e.g., `@profiler Why is my app slow?`)

## Roadmap

The Profiler Agent currently supports high CPU and memory analysis for .NET workloads, with enhancements planned for future releases. Whether you're optimizing a service, game engine, or UI, the Profiler Agent is designed to make professional-grade profiling accessible to every developer.
