# GitHub Bug Bounty: Enhanced Incentives for Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2025

October marks Cybersecurity Awareness Month—a period highlighting the importance of security for the worldwide developer community. GitHub's Bug Bounty team celebrates by recognizing the vital work of security researchers and launching new ways to reward impactful contributions.

## Special Incentives in October 2025

For October 1–31, 2025, GitHub will grant an **additional 10% bonus** on all eligible, valid vulnerability submissions that pertain to the following features:

- [Copilot Coding Agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent)
- [GitHub Spark](https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark)
- [Copilot Spaces](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-29-introducing-copilot-spaces-a-new-way-to-work-with-code-and-context/)

**To qualify**, researchers must ensure their reports clearly explain how the vulnerability connects to one of these features. Full details about program scope and rewards are available on [bounty.github.com](https://bounty.github.com/).

## 2025 Glass Firewall Conference

In partnership with Capital One, Salesforce, and HackerOne, GitHub is co-hosting the [Glass Firewall Conference](https://h1.community/events/details/hackerone-diversity-and-inclusion-di-presents-2025-glass-firewall-conference-breaking-bytes-and-barriers/). This exclusive gathering supports women pursuing careers or hobbies in security research and ethical hacking, aiming to foster an inclusive, supportive environment. Attendees can explore foundational knowledge, connect with peers, and be inspired to start or grow their journey in cybersecurity.

## Researcher Spotlight
