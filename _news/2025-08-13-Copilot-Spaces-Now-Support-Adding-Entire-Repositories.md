# Copilot Spaces Now Support Adding Entire Repositories

GitHub Copilot Spaces has introduced a new feature that enables users to add entire repositories to their spaces, making it easier and faster to work with large or unfamiliar codebases.

## What’s New

- **Add entire repositories** directly to your Copilot Space for faster setup and exploration.

## Key Benefits

- **Quick exploration**: Get up to speed on unfamiliar codebases by including everything up front.
- **Cross-cutting features**: Ideal for work that spans multiple files, folders, or components.
- **One-click setup**: Streamline your workspace by adding a whole repo instead of selecting files individually.

## How to Use

1. Open your Copilot Space and select **Add Sources**.
2. Choose **Add files and repositories**.
3. Select the repository you wish to add.
4. On the file selection screen, use **Add repository** to include the whole repo in your space.

## Pro Tips

- When you add a repository, Copilot searches the whole repo for relevant content to assist you.
- For best results, continue to add files you know are critical for your specific task. This lets Copilot prioritize its context.

## Additional Improvements

- **Navigation**: Jump into spaces more quickly from github.com/copilot.
- **List view**: Spaces now display in an easy-to-browse format, with a new search feature for finding your spaces.
- **In-place editing**: Modify titles and descriptions directly from your space.
- **Unified view**: Resources and conversations can now be accessed together via tab switching.
- **Icon updates**: Improved clarity for all spaces’ features.

These changes together streamline the Copilot Spaces workflow, making it more powerful for code exploration and project management within GitHub.
