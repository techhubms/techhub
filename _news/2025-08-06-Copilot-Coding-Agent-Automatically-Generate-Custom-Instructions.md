Allison details how GitHub Copilot Coding Agent can automatically generate custom instructions for your repositories, allowing developers to delegate tasks and improve pull request quality using Copilot.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Copilot Coding Agent: Automatically Generate Custom Instructions

GitHub Copilot Coding Agent is designed to help developers delegate tasks within their repositories, enabling Copilot to work in the background and produce more effective results. By adding custom instructions, you can guide Copilotâ€™s understanding of your project and specify how to build, test, and validate changes. This leads to higher quality pull requests that are easier to merge quickly.

## Automatic Generation of Custom Instructions

The Copilot Coding Agent can now automatically generate these custom instructions for your repository. When you first request a pull request in a repository using Copilot, a comment is added to the draft pull request with a link to generate customized guidance. You can also generate instructions at any time using the recommended prompt in the GitHub documentation.

## Availability and Integration

The Copilot Coding Agent is in public preview for Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise users, given the appropriate policies are enabled by an administrator. It is integrated into github.com, major IDEs, GitHub Mobile, GitHub CLI, and the GitHub MCP Server, ensuring developers can delegate tasks from multiple environments.
