Allison reports on the addition of the last_authenticated_at field to the GitHub Copilot user management API, improving access to users' authentication timestamps for developers and administrators.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Copilot User Management API Now Includes last_authenticated_at Field

GitHub has updated the [Copilot user management API](https://docs.github.com/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization) by adding a new field: `last_authenticated_at`. This field makes it possible to programmatically retrieve the UTC timestamp of a user's most recent authentication directly from the API.

Previously, this information was only accessible via the activity report CSV export, making real-time automation and integration scenarios more cumbersome. With this update, developers and administrators can:

- Access each Copilot user's last authentication time directly in API responses
- Avoid relying on manual or periodic CSV reports for this critical data
- Integrate authentication tracking into custom dashboards, monitoring solutions, and audit workflows
- Maintain existing integrations effortlessly, as the change is non-breaking and backward-compatible

**No breaking changes** have been introduced in the API schema, ensuring smooth adoption. For more details, visit the [GitHub Copilot user management API documentation](https://docs.github.com/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization).

## Summary

- **Field added**: `last_authenticated_at`
- **Purpose**: Returns UTC timestamp of a user's latest authentication
- **Availability**: Now accessible directly via API
- **Schema impact**: Non-breaking change

This addition supports improved oversight of Copilot usage and aligns with best practices in account management and security.
