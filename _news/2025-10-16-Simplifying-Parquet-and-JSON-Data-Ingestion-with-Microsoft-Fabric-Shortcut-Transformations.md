# Simplifying Parquet & JSON Data Ingestion with Microsoft Fabric Shortcut Transformations

Microsoft Fabric now offers Shortcut Transformations, a feature designed to simplify and automate the ingestion of Parquet and JSON files into Delta tables. The traditional headaches of encoding, schema drift, and pipeline fragility are eliminated, providing a low-code and resilient data onboarding experience for data engineering teams.

## Key Challenges for Data Engineers

- **Dealing with huge, compressed Parquet files and deeply nested JSON logs**
- **Schema changes and new file formats** constantly breaking ETL pipelines
- **Custom Spark jobs and complex monitoring** for file ingestion

## What Are Shortcut Transformations?

Shortcut Transformations provide a no-code interface in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse for transforming raw file data (Parquet, JSON, CSV) directly into Delta tables. This solution:

- **Automatically infers and aligns schemas**, even with nested data up to 5 levels deep
- **Supports various file formats**: .parquet, .json, .jsonl, .ndjson (and more coming soon)
- **Handles compressed files**: Snappy, LZ4, Gzip, Brotli, and Zstandard
- **Validates schemas** and logs non-intrusive mismatches for transparency
- **Case-insensitive schema mapping and column order independence**
- **Supports continuous sync**, with automatic change detection for new or deleted files
- **Ensures reliability** through ACID guarantees, high concurrency, and time travel support
- **Monitors ingestion** with detailed error and success logs in JSON format accessible in the monitoring hub

## How It Works

1. Select or create a new Fabric Lakehouse.
2. Use the New Table Shortcut to choose your data source (Azure Data Lake, Azure Blob Storage, Dataverse, Amazon S3, GCP, SharePoint, OneDrive, etc.).
3. Pick the source folder and configure transformations with a wizard.
4. Save your Shortcut; new files are ingested automatically, and changes are synced.
5. Track refreshes and logs directly in the Manage Shortcuts and Monitoring hub in Fabric.

## Real-World Persona Applications

- **Retail**: Automated ingestion of product catalog updates across formats and vendors.
- **Finance**: Flattening and validating transaction data for fraud detection and compliance, with no Spark code needed.
- **Healthcare**: Handling IoT and patient device data in varied JSON structures, with schema consistency and troubleshooting.
- **Manufacturing**: Streaming sensor data from thousands of machines for predictive maintenance in Delta tables.
- **Energy**: Aggregating smart meter and weather forecast data for load balancing and outage prediction.

## Upcoming Features

- **Excel to Delta support** with multi-tab schema inference
- **Dynamic Schema Evolution** to adapt on the fly to changing data
- **Schema definition, preview, and custom error handling** for advanced use
- **Enhanced monitoring** with more granular metrics and consolidated log files
