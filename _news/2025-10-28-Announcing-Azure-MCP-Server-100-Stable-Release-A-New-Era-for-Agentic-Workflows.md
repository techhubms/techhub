# Announcing Azure MCP Server 1.0.0 Stable Release – A New Era for Agentic Workflows

**Author:** Sandeep Sen

Azure MCP Server 1.0 is now officially live, representing a game-changing leap in agentic development and cloud automation. This open-source implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI agents and developers to access and manage Azure services using both natural language and code, via a standard protocol for interoperability and automation.

## What is Azure MCP Server?

Azure MCP Server is an open-source platform designed to connect AI agents with Azure's broad service ecosystem. It supports a "write once" approach for automation across:

- AI services: Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search
- Databases: Postgres, Kusto
- Messaging: Event Hubs, Service Bus
- Compute: Azure Function Apps
- Infrastructure: Resource Groups, App Configuration, Azure Storage, Log Analytics
- CLI integrations: Azure CLI, Azure Developer CLI (azd)

Agents can query, manage, and automate cloud workflows securely, with actions triggered by both natural language and code. Common agent interfaces like GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, custom MCP clients, and frameworks such as Agent Framework are supported.

## Why This Matters

Azure MCP Server offers a universal, open protocol (MCP), enabling:

- Cross-service automation through a common interface
- Natural language interaction for querying databases, managing storage/logs, running CLI commands
- Seamless integration with existing developer IDEs and tools
- Secure, scalable, and reliable operations backed by Microsoft security standards

## 1.0 Stable Release Highlights

- **Support for 47+ Azure services** out of the box
- Native integration with popular IDEs: Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ
- Available as a Docker container for CI/CD and DevOps workflows
- Over 170 tools consolidated and refined for discoverability and usability
- Flexible operational modes: `namespace`, `all`, and `single` tool modes for onboarding, debugging, or scaling
- Security-first design: User confirmations required for sensitive actions, rigorous threat modeling and Responsible AI reviews
- Optimized with .NET AOT compilation for improved startup and resource efficiency

## Ecosystem and Tooling

- IDE Extensions: VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ (with ongoing platform expansion)
- Docker Image: Pull from Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) for containers and pipelines
- Marketplace Exposure: Available in IDE marketplaces and listed in platforms like Cline
- Continuous integration with DevOps workflows for agentic automation
