# Introducing the New Test Run Hub in Azure Test Plans

Delivering high-quality software is a necessity, and Azure Test Plans now features the all-new Test Run Hubâ€”designed to empower teams to take control of their testing process and drive continuous improvement.

## What Makes the Test Run Hub a Must-Have?

The Test Run Hub allows teams to:

- Track test progress in real time
- Analyze historical results for quality assessment
- Maintain visibility and quality across every development cycle
- Manage both manual and automated tests efficiently

## Key Benefits

- **Real-Time Visibility:** Instantly monitor test progress and spot regressions or failures early in the release cycle.
- **Comprehensive Analytics:** Audit and analyze past test data for continuous improvement of your testing strategy.
- **Seamless End-to-End Flow:** Integrates with both manual and automated pipelines to capture every test execution detail.

## Effortless Test Run Management

- Access test runs easily via the Test Plans section in Azure DevOps.
- Use advanced filters (timeline, run type, run ID, and more) to quickly locate relevant test runs.
- Customize dashboard views with persistent search and column settings.

## Actionable Insights at Your Fingertips

- Each test run includes a built-in analytics dashboard.
- Results can be filtered and drilled down by outcome, priority, configuration, failure type, and resolution.
- Interactive dashboard tiles allow focus on specific quality metrics.

## Collaboration and Attachments

- Attach screenshots, logs, and artifacts directly to test runs.
- Link test results to Azure DevOps work items (bugs, tasks, etc.).
- Collaborate via run-level markdown-supported comments and detailed analysis fields.

## Highlights of the Latest Improvements

- **Filtering Enhancements:**
  - Filter by the pipeline, area path, and persist filter preferences per user.
- **Attachment Management:**
  - Expanded support for previewing and deleting attachments.
- **Markdown Controls:**
  - Enhanced comment formatting options via markdown.

## Programmatic Access for Advanced Teams

- Full support for programmatic management via the [Azure DevOps REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/test/runs?view=azure-devops-rest-7.1).
- Extend dropdown menus, automate test run reporting, and integrate with other toolchains.

## Availability and Feedback

- The Test Run Hub is being gradually enabled for all Azure DevOps organizations (currently Public Preview).
- Capabilities depend on your organization's license. [Learn more about Azure Test Plans licensing and trials](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/test-plans).
