Allison discusses new GitHub features for pull request reviews, enabling comments on any line of changed files and improved single file navigation, benefiting developers and reviewers.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Enhanced GitHub Pull Request Files Changed Page: Comment Anywhere in Changed Files

GitHub has rolled out a major update to the pull request “Files changed” page in public preview, making code reviews more flexible and collaborative for development teams.

## Major Feature: Comment on Any Line of Changed Files

Developers can now comment on any line in a changed file, not just the three lines around a change. This means you can:

- Flag changes that should have been made
- Suggest edits to lines outside the immediate diff
- Provide extra context to reviewers, even on unchanged parts of changed files

**How to use the new commenting feature:**

1. Open the new “Files changed” page within your pull request.
2. Expand diffs to view unchanged lines.
3. Click the `+` button on any line to add a comment or suggestion.

Comments placed this way will show up on both the "Files changed" and "Conversation" pages, helping keep reviews organized and thorough.

**Note:** The feature is rolling out progressively per repository.

### API and UI Considerations

- Comments on unchanged lines are accessible through existing API endpoints and webhook events, though API support is limited for now.
- If you view a pull request with such comments using the classic interface, you’ll see a warning message letting you know additional comments are available only on the new page.
- Positioning logic for all comments has changed, so you may notice differences in how comment threads are displayed.

## Single File Mode Improvements

Single file mode is designed to help reviewers work through large pull requests more easily. The latest update brings:

- **Automatic navigation:** Marking a file as viewed moves you to the next file.
- **Accurate navigation:** The next/previous file buttons respect applied filters.
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Use `J` for next file, `K` for previous file.
- **Clear feedback:** A message appears in single file mode to reduce confusion.
- **Handling large/deleted files:** Files that aren’t rendered no longer affect single file mode.
- **Bug fixes:** Issues around unnecessary fetches and file filtering have been resolved.

## Feedback

GitHub encourages users to provide feedback via dedicated community links:

- [New ‘Files changed’ page feedback](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback)
- [Comment anywhere on changed file feedback](https://gh.io/comment-any-line-feedback)

*Disclaimer: Public preview UI features are subject to change.*
