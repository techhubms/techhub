# GitHub Changes Default Tab Size from Eight to Four Spaces

## What’s New

GitHub has updated the default tab size for displaying code and code snippets. The new default is now four spaces instead of eight, affecting all logged-out users and new accounts. This change is designed to align code presentation on GitHub with common development standards, making code easier to read and preventing excessive indentation.

## Problem Statement

Previously, a default of eight spaces for tabs led to deeper indentation, which many developers found inconsistent with their own environments. Many users are unaware they can change tab size in settings, so GitHub is now standardizing four spaces for a more familiar developer experience. Logged-in users can still customize their tab size through **Settings > Appearance**, and the new default does not affect current users unless they change it manually.

## Providing Feedback

GitHub welcomes feedback regarding this update. Developers can share their thoughts or report issues in the [Community Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/168948). This collaborative feedback will help refine and improve the platform's code viewing experience.
