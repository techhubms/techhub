Authored by Allison, this news discusses updates to the GitHub Copilot coding agent, focusing on improved pull request review experiences and explicit interaction controls for repository collaborators.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Copilot Coding Agent: Enhanced Pull Request Review Experience

### Overview

GitHub Copilot's coding agent allows users to delegate coding tasks, which are then completed by the agent in the background. Upon completing a task, Copilot automatically opens a pull request, pushes its changes, and requests a review from the repository maintainers or collaborators.

### Updated Pull Request Review Experience

Responding to user feedback and aiming to clarify intent during code review, GitHub updated Copilot's interaction model in pull requests. Now, Copilot will only respond and make further changes if someone with write access explicitly mentions it by using `@copilot` in a comment. This modification directly impacts how feedback is handled in code reviews:

- **Explicit Command Trigger:** Copilot requires an explicit `@copilot` mention by a collaborator with write access to take further action. This prevents unintended activations and ensures Copilot doesn't interpret general comments as commands.
- **Unintrusive Note-Taking:** Users can leave general notes, thoughts, or feedback in pull request comments without triggering Copilot to make changes. This provides flexibility for collaborative communication within pull requests.
- **Final Say in Changes:** Although others can provide feedback or suggestions on Copilotâ€™s pull request, only individuals with write access can instruct Copilot to modify the proposed changes, granting explicit control over what changes are ultimately implemented.

### Key Implications

- **Improved Collaboration:** Reduces the chance of accidental Copilot actions due to ambiguous comments, leading to a clearer and more predictable workflow.
- **Fine-Grained Control:** Gives repository maintainers more precise authority over when Copilot participates in code changes.
- **Smoother Feedback Cycle:** Encourages open discussion and feedback in pull request threads without the risk of Copilot acting unexpectedly.
