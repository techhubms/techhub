Authored by the Microsoft Fabric Blog, this article presents practical advice for leveraging the Terraform Provider and Fabric CLI for automating Microsoft Fabric resource administration.<!--excerpt_end-->

### Overview

The article introduces updates in Microsoft Fabric's ecosystem, highlighting the general availability of the Microsoft Fabric CLI and the Terraform Provider for Microsoft Fabric. These advancements are geared toward users experienced with Terraform and infrastructure as code, enabling efficient, automated administration of Fabric resources.

### Key Developments

- **Microsoft Fabric CLI (Command Line Interface):** The CLI offers administrators and developers effective control over Fabric environments through command-line actions, supporting automation and scripting for recurring tasks.
- **Terraform Provider for Microsoft Fabric:** This provider has become generally available, allowing administrators to define and manage Microsoft Fabric resources declaratively, leveraging Terraform's established syntax and workflow.
- **MCP Servers:** The article references using MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform) servers in conjunction with the Fabric CLI, assisting in the accurate definition of fabric resources and further enhancing automation potential.

### Practical Guidance

The blog post is part of a series designed to offer step-by-step, practical instruction to:

- Integrate the Fabric CLI with Terraform workflows for seamless administration.
- Use MCP servers to help define and manage Fabric resources programmatically.
- Employ infrastructure as code best practices to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and simplicity when managing cloud resources.

### Benefits

- **Automation:** Reduces administrative overhead by automating recurring tasks.
- **Declarative Resource Management:** Ensures configurations can be version-controlled and deployed consistently across environments.
- **Seamless Integration:** Those already using Terraform can adopt Fabric resource management using familiar tools and structures.

### Audience

This content is aimed at:

- Cloud administrators and DevOps professionals working with Microsoft Fabric.
- Organizations seeking to streamline deployment and management of Microsoft Fabric resources.
- Those experienced in Terraform and infrastructure as code practices looking to extend their skills to Microsoft Fabric.

### Further Information

The article is the second in a series, suggesting additional posts will offer more detailed, hands-on guidance for optimizing the deployment and management process within Microsoft Fabric.
