# Cybersecurity Awareness Month: Elevating Security Culture with Microsoft Resources

**By Vasu Jakkal**

Cybersecurity is not just about technology, but about empowering people to develop strong, everyday security habits. In recognition of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, Microsoft emphasizes the importance of building a culture where security is a shared responsibility—both at work and in personal life.

## Microsoft Secure Future Initiative (SFI)

To strengthen its commitment, Microsoft launched the Secure Future Initiative (SFI), focusing on embedding security throughout its technology stack, culture, and governance processes. Since November 2023, more than 34,000 engineers have been mobilized to improve risk mitigation. Notable SFI results include:

- 100% protection of production system accounts with phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)
- 92% of employee productivity accounts secured with MFA
- 99% enforcement of video-based verification during new employee setups

## Actionable Security Resources

Microsoft offers a suite of resources for both security professionals and everyday users, including:

- [Be Cybersmart Kit](https://aka.ms/becybersmartkit): Articles and tools on AI safety, device security, domain impersonation, phishing, and more
- [SFI Patterns and Practices](https://aka.ms/SFI_PatternsAndPracticesPage): A library of actionable security guidance for organizations
- [Cybersecurity Awareness Site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cybersecurity-awareness): Training materials for raising awareness
- [Cybersecurity education](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/yrrbdgy2d6158?source=docs&amp;culture=en-us&amp;country=us): Expert-level learning paths, certifications, and technical documentation
- [Microsoft Cybersecurity Scholarship Program](https://www.lastmile-ed.org/microsoftcybersecurityscholarship) and [Microsoft Elevate](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/elevate?msockid=208b42a480e96985268d5613815368fe): For students and aspiring professionals

## Fostering Security Awareness: The Franciscan Alliance Example

Franciscan Alliance, an Indiana-based healthcare organization, exemplifies a security-first approach by integrating:

- Monthly phishing simulations and quarterly security assessments
- Non-punitive, education-focused responses for staff needing improvement
- Gamified training to boost engagement
- Monthly newsletters and weekly updates during Cybersecurity Awareness Month
- Collaborative threat briefings and use of [Microsoft’s Cybersecurity Awareness](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cybersecurity-awareness) resources

## Security in the Age of AI

With the rise of AI, robust security measures and responsible governance are essential. Microsoft encourages leadership to stay informed through:

- The webinar [“Trust in AI: Accelerate Business Growth with Confidence.”](https://aka.ms/Trust-Webinar)
- The NASDAQ Summit panel “Cyber and AI, Strategic Risk and Competitive Advantage” discussing governance, regulation, and real-world AI deployments
