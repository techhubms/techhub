# Letâ€™s Learn MCP Series Recap: 8 Languages, 4 Code Bases, Full Resources

*By Katie Savage*

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming the core standard for connecting AI agents to a wide variety of external tools and services. Within a few months, MCP has gained significant traction, with a rising presence at developer events and growing adoption from organizations large and small.

To help meet the demand for accessible training, Microsoft launched a beginner-friendly series of MCP training events. If you missed these, they are available on-demand, along with full resource links and code repositories to help you get started.

## What is MCP?
