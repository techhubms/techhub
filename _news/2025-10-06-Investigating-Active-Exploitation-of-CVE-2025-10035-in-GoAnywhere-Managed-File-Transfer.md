# Investigating Active Exploitation of CVE-2025-10035 in GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer

*By Microsoft Threat Intelligence*

## Overview

A high-severity deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-10035) impacting GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) is actively being exploited by Storm-1175—a threat group linked to financially driven attacks and Medusa ransomware deployment. Exploitation of this flaw could allow remote code execution (RCE) via the MFT License Servlet.

## Vulnerability Details

- **CVE**: [CVE-2025-10035](https://www.cve.org/cverecord?id=CVE-2025-10035)
- **Impact**: Arbitrary deserialization leading to command injection and potential RCE.
- **Affected Versions**: GoAnywhere MFT Admin Console up to version 7.8.3.
- **Attack scenario**: Attackers craft a forged license response signature, bypassing verification, to trigger deserialization of malicious objects. No authentication is required if the attacker has or can intercept a valid license response.

## Attack Chain by Storm-1175

- **Initial Access**: Zero-day exploitation of the GoAnywhere MFT deserialization flaw.
- **Persistence**: Dropping Remote Monitoring & Management (RMM) tools such as SimpleHelp and MeshAgent directly under the MFT process; creation of malicious `.jsp` files in MFT directories.
- **Discovery and Movement**:
  - Execution of user and system discovery commands
  - Network scanning with tools like netscan
  - Lateral movement using `mstsc.exe` (Remote Desktop)
- **Command and Control**:
  - RMM tools and a Cloudflare tunnel for secure C2
- **Exfiltration**: Use of Rclone for data extraction
- **Ransomware Deployment**: Medusa ransomware execution observed in some victim environments

## Mitigation and Protection Guidance

- **Upgrade** to the latest version of GoAnywhere MFT as per [Fortra’s official instructions](https://www.goanywhere.com/resources/articles/how-to-upgrade-goanywhere-mft). Investigate for historical compromise, as upgrades do not remove persistence from prior exploitation.
- **Perimeter Defense**: Employ solutions like Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (EASM) to map vulnerable services. Restrict arbitrary outbound connectivity from servers.
- **EDR & AV Recommendations**:
  - Run [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc) in block mode
  - Enable [automated investigation and remediation](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc)
  - Use [attack surface reduction rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc) to block prevalent malware vectors
  - Specialized rules: block untrusted executables, web shell creation, and implement advanced protection against ransomware

## Microsoft Defender Detections

- **Defender for Endpoint**
  - Alerts for exploitation attempts, remote access software deployment, suspicious file/service activity, lateral movement, and ransomware presence
- **Defender Vulnerability Management**: Identification of at-risk devices for CVE-2025-10035
- **Defender XDR & Experts for XDR**: Centralized detection, response, and proactive notification of post-exploitation activity
- **Defender Copilot**: Security Copilot can be used to investigate incidents, automate threat hunting, and utilize relevant promptbooks for incident response

## Hunting Queries & Threat Intelligence

- **Sample Queries in Microsoft Defender XDR**:
  - Identify vulnerable devices:

    ```kusto
    DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
    | where CveId in ("CVE-2025-10035")
    | summarize by DeviceName, CveId
    ```

  - Identify exploitation attempts with powershell/cmd.exe in the context of GoAnywhere MFT
  - Find observed attacker tool hashes in file/process event tables
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**:
  - **File Hashes** (SimpleHelp, MeshAgent):
