# How the International Telecommunication Union Open Sourced Its Tech: A Four-Step Guide

*By Joshua Ku*

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations agency specializing in digital technologies, recently took a major step in democratizing its technology by moving from a closed Azure DevOps setup to an open source community model. This article outlines the process for organizations and nonprofits considering a similar transition, leveraging ITU’s six-month collaboration with GitHub volunteers.

## 1. Researching Effective Open Source Practices

- **Repository Exploration:** The team analyzed a variety of open source repositories—ranging from new to mature—to identify documentation, community guidelines, and contributor onboarding practices worth emulating.
- **Key Takeaways:** Effective READMEs, clear documentation, and inspiring contributor guides set the foundation for successful community engagement.

## 2. Refining the Open Source Mindset and Preparing Code

- **Code Scrubbing:** Sensitive or non-public code sections were removed, and sample data with clear formatting guides was introduced.
- **Onboarding Materials:** The team developed a comprehensive “Getting Started” guide and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file outlining the responsibilities and expectations for new contributors.
- **Quality Assurance:** Automated tests and linting were instituted to ensure code consistency, with continuous integration recommended to maintain software reliability.

## 3. Addressing Licensing

- **License Selection:** ITU settled on the BSD-2 license to allow broad use while requiring source and binary redistribution to include attribution.
- **Compatibility Assessment:** Existing project dependencies and usage scenarios were considered to ensure license compatibility.

## 4. Engaging the Open Source Community

- **Lowering Barriers for Contribution:** “Good first issue” tags and clear issues were created to welcome newcomers.
- **Community Building:** By actively involving external developers and adopting open documentation and contribution workflows, ITU fostered broader collaboration.

## Key Results and Takeaways

- Collaboration with GitHub volunteers helped ITU align with current open source best practices and prepare for wider external engagement.
- The organization became more adept at supporting a global contributor base and is committed to open-sourcing more of its projects in the future.
- The model demonstrates that, with structured planning and incremental steps, even large organizations can successfully foster open source communities.
