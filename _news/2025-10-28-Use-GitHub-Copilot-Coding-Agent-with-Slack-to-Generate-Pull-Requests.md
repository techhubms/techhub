Allison explains the new integration between the GitHub Copilot coding agent and Slack, allowing developers to automate pull request generation and streamline common coding tasks from within Slack.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Work with Copilot Coding Agent in Slack

The GitHub app for Slack now integrates with the GitHub Copilot coding agent, empowering developers to automate the creation of pull requests directly from Slack conversations.

## Key Features

- **Automated Pull Request Generation**: Mention `@GitHub` in a Slack thread with a coding prompt (e.g., “Fix missing tooltips on navigation icons”) to instruct Copilot coding agent to create and submit a pull request.
- **Asynchronous Task Automation**: Copilot coding agent can autonomously handle tasks such as bug fixes, implementing new features, improving test coverage, and performing refactors, all triggered from within Slack.
- **Integration Rollout**: The feature is rolling out gradually. If it's not yet available in your Slack workspace, check again in a few hours.

## Getting Started

1. **Enable Copilot Coding Agent**: Ensure the Copilot coding agent is enabled on your GitHub account—available with paid Copilot plans. Business or Enterprise users may need admin approval or policy updates.
2. **Install/Upgrade GitHub App for Slack**: Find the [GitHub app for Slack](https://slack.com/marketplace/A01BP7R4KNY-github) and install or upgrade it.
3. **Link Your GitHub Account**: Follow the prompts to link your GitHub account within Slack for seamless integration.
4. **Use Slack Prompting**: In any Slack thread, mention `@GitHub` with your desired coding task. Copilot coding agent will process the prompt and reply with a review-ready pull request.

## Optional Upgrade & Permissions

- Adoption of the Copilot coding agent’s new features requires granting additional permissions. Users who prefer the classic GitHub app functionality can choose not to upgrade and continue with notifications, issue triage, and manual PR management.
