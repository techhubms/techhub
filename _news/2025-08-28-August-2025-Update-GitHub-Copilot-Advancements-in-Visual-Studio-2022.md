# GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio â€” August 2025 Update

The August 2025 update for Visual Studio 2022 (v17.14) focuses on delivering smarter AI capabilities to developers using GitHub Copilot.

## Key Highlights

- **GPT-5 Model Support**: Developers can now leverage GPT-5 in Visual Studio to benefit from more precise and context-aware code suggestions and chat interactions within their coding environment.
- **MCP General Availability**: The MCP feature is now available for all users, providing a seamless experience to connect and manage full-stack environments. It introduces one-click server installation and secure, integrated sign-in.
- **Smarter Copilot Chat**: Copilot Chat now better understands project codebases by retrieving relevant snippets and interpreting Git history, offering developers enhanced context and actionable guidance as they work.
- **Bring Your Own Model**: Users may connect external models by supplying API keys from providers like OpenAI, Google, or Anthropic, enabling developers to customize their AI-assisted coding experience.
- **Google Account Sign-up**: Developers can now sign up for GitHub Copilot directly within Visual Studio using Google credentials.
- **Greater Control over Suggestions**: Improvements allow users to choose when suggestions appear, control access to next edits, and accept completions incrementally (by word or line).

## Looking Ahead

The roadmap includes future features for Copilot in Visual Studio:

- New debugging and profiling modes
- Improved agent mode for performance and added functionality
- Advanced MCP prompt resources and registry support
- Copilot-powered all-in-one search capabilities
