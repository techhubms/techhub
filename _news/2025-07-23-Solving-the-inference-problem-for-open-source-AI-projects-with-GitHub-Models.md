# Solving the Inference Problem for Open Source AI Projects with GitHub Models

**By Sean Goedecke**

AI features can make open source projects stand out, yet adoption often stalls at the setup stage. When users or contributors are required to provide a paid inference API key, this creates a significant barrier:

```bash
$ my-cool-ai-tool
Error: OPENAI_API_KEY not found
```

Developers are frequently hesitant to purchase paid plans solely to try a tool, while self-hosting large language models (LLMs) may exceed the capabilities of most laptops or GitHub Actions runners. Distributing container images with bundled model weights increases installation size and can slow CI workflows. Each new requirement narrows your audience.

## The Problem: Friction in Adding AI to Open Source

Adding AI sounds simple but is often hampered by:

- **Paid APIs:** Requiring users to obtain an OpenAI or Anthropic API key is prohibitively expensive for many, particularly hobbyists and students.
- **Local models:** Running complex models often exceeds ordinary hardware capabilities, and certainly the 14 GB container size available to GitHub Actions runners.
- **Bundling Weights:** Including model weights can make projects unwieldy to install and use.

Open source maintainers need an inference endpoint that is:

1. Free for public projects
2. Compatible with existing OpenAI SDKs
3. Available wherever code is executed (laptops, servers, CI runners)

## Introducing GitHub Models

**GitHub Models** provides a solution with a free, OpenAI-compatible inference API. Key features include:

- **REST API:** Follows the familiar chat/completions specification
- **Model Selection:** Offers curated LLMs like GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama 3, and more, all hosted by GitHub
- **Access:** Any GitHub user with a Personal Access Token (PAT), or any repository with the correct permissions, can use the service
- **Cost:** Free for individual accounts and open source orgs, with paid tiers unlocking higher throughput and larger context windows

The API is designed to be a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's, so compatible clients include OpenAI-JS, OpenAI Python, LangChain, llamacpp, or simple `curl` requests.

## Getting Started with GitHub Models

Because the API matches OpenAI's `chat/completions`, most inference SDKs can use it directly. Example (using the OpenAI SDK):

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
    baseURL: "https://models.github.ai/inference/chat/completions",
    apiKey: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN // or any PAT with models:read
});

const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "openai/gpt-4o",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hi!" }]
});
console.log(res.choices[0].message.content);
```

For GitHub Actions, requesting the `models:read` permission allows the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` to make inference requests, eliminating the need for users to supply a PAT.

### Example Scenarios for GitHub Actions

- Code review or PR triage bots
- Smart issue tagging workflows
- Weekly repository reporting
- Any GitHub Action that can benefit from AI support

By defaulting to GitHub Models, you drastically lower the setup barrier for both users and contributors.

## Zero-Configuration CI with GitHub Actions

Previously, Actions requiring AI inference needed users to add secret API keys. Now, with GitHub Models:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/triage.yml

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  models: read  # Enables GitHub Models for the GITHUB_TOKEN

jobs:
  triage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Smart issue triage
      run: node scripts/triage.js
```

Your Action can now execute AI-powered tasks such as:

- Automated pull request summaries
- Issue deduplication and tagging
- Weekly repository digests
- Any scripted workflow leveraging LLMs

## Scaling Up Usage

The GitHub Models API is free for all, but there may be limits on requests per minute (RPM) and context window size. Upgrading to a metered paid tier increases these limits and enables larger models/context windows, with improved latency due to dedicated deployments.

To scale:

- Enable paid usage from your organization or enterprise settings under **Settings > Models**
- Existing workflows and tokens continue to function, with enhanced capacity

## Key Takeaways

- Open source AI projects often lose potential users due to the requirement of paid API keys
- GitHub Models provides a frictionless, free alternative compatible with existing OpenAI infrastructure
- Makes it easier for both end users and contributors to quickly set up and run your AI-powered software
- Especially powerful when paired with GitHub Actions, enabling hands-off CI/CD integration

By choosing GitHub Models as your default inference provider, you remove a major blocker to open source AI adoption. More users can try your project instantly, and more developers can contribute.
