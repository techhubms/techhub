# Removal of {{CONTENT}} Copilot Premium Request Budgets for Enterprise and Team Accounts

GitHub is set to remove the {{CONTENT}} Copilot premium request budgets for enterprise and team accounts created before August 22, 2025, starting November 18, 2025.

## Who Is Affected?

- **Enterprise and organization accounts** with an account-level {{CONTENT}} Copilot premium request budget created before August 22, 2025.
- **Pro and Pro+ Copilot** users are **not affected** and will retain {{CONTENT}} budgets by default.

## Why Is This Change Happening?

- **Granular Controls with Less Complexity:** Each AI tool (e.g., coding agent, Spark) will have its own SKU for premium request usage. Retaining the {{CONTENT}} budget model would require manual management for each tool, increasing administrative overhead as the AI portfolio grows.
- **Simplifies Billing:** Removing the {{CONTENT}} budget reduces friction, streamlining administration for account owners when scaling Copilot usage.

## What Do Admins Need to Do?

- Review and, if needed, update your premium request paid usage policy in GitHub Copilot settings.
- Paid usage can be disabled at any time through the Copilot policy controls.

## Additional Resources

- [Premium request documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests?versionId=enterprise-cloud@latest&productId=billing)
- [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/173899)
- Contact your GitHub account team for more information.

## Summary

Administrators should review their Copilot paid usage policies ahead of November 18, 2025, to ensure seamless usage management after the {{CONTENT}} budget model is retired. This change provides improved billing clarity and paves the way for more granular management of Copilot and other GitHub AI tool consumption.
