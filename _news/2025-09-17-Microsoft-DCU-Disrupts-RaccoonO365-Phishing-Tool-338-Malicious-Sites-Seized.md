# Microsoft DCU Disrupts RaccoonO365 Phishing Tool: 338 Malicious Sites Seized

## Overview

Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) has disrupted RaccoonO365, a rapidly growing subscription-based phishing platform, by seizing 338 websites that were used by cybercriminals to steal Microsoft 365 credentials. This joint operation, leveraging a court order from the Southern District of New York, not only dismantled the infrastructure used for large-scale phishing but also cut off criminals’ access to millions of potential victims.

## What is RaccoonO365?

- **A subscription service:** RaccoonO365 offers phishing kits that mimic legitimate Microsoft communications, allowing even unskilled actors to steal Microsoft 365 usernames and passwords.
- **Massive reach:** Since July 2024, these kits have stolen at least 5,000 sets of Microsoft credentials across 94 countries.
- **Healthcare impacts:** Over 20 U.S. healthcare organizations were targeted, leading to threats against patient care, data, and critical services.

## Tactics and Consequences

- **Sophisticated social engineering:** Attackers use Microsoft branding to create convincing phishing emails, attachments, and websites.
- **Bypassing protections:** Kits are designed to evade multi-factor authentication and scale attacks (up to 9,000 targets a day per customer).
- **AI-powered operations:** The introduction of "RaccoonO365 AI-MailCheck" promises even more sophisticated, automated attacks.

## Investigation and Legal Action

- **Attribution:** The DCU identified Joshua Ogundipe, based in Nigeria, as the leader. The service was marketed on Telegram with over 850 subscribers.
- **Crypto-financing:** The criminal enterprise received at least $100,000 in cryptocurrency, with evidence gathered via blockchain analysis tools like Chainalysis Reactor.
- **Global collaboration:** Microsoft worked with Health-ISAC, law enforcement, and Cloudflare to dismantle infrastructure and disrupt revenue streams.

## Addressing Global Cybercrime

- **International legal challenges:** Varying global laws make prosecution difficult, underscoring the need for international cooperation on cybercrime enforcement.
- **Industry response:** Seizing websites is just the beginning; Microsoft continues ongoing legal steps to deter and dismantle reemerging infrastructure.

## Defensive Recommendations

- **Technical defenses:** Organizations should enable strong multi-factor authentication, use up-to-date security tools, and educate users about phishing risks.
- **Cross-sector cooperation:** The operation emphasizes the importance of industry, government, and civil society collaboration to build safer digital environments.

## Key Takeaways

- Phishing-as-a-service lowers barriers for cybercriminals, increasing the threat landscape for Microsoft 365 and all users.
- Legal, technical, and cross-sectoral collaboration is critical to fighting evolving cyber threats.
- Bolstering defenses and staying informed remains essential for organizations and individuals alike.
