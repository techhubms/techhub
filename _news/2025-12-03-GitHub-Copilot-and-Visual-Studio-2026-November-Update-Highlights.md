# GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio 2026: November Update

Allison presents the latest release news for Visual Studio 2026 and describes new ways GitHub Copilot supports developers:

## Highlights

- **Visual Studio 2026 General Availability:**
  - The newest version of Visual Studio is available [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads). It includes improved performance, updated UX, and enhanced AI-assisted workflows.

- **GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent (Public Preview):**
  - Developers can delegate repetitive coding tasks directly from Visual Studio. By enabling 'Copilot Coding Agent (Preview)' in settings, users offload tasks such as UI cleanup, refactoring, documentation updates, and multi-file edits while focusing on core development work.

- **Copilot Actions in Context Menu:**
  - Access new quick actions within Visual Studio's context menu to generate code comments, explanations, and optimizations with a single click.

- **Intent Detection for Search:**
  - Copilot now analyzes file search terms, detects typos or fuzzy queries, and recommends likely matches to improve navigation and file discovery.

Explore more about these features in the [Visual Studio blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-november-update-visual-studio-2026-cloud-agent-preview-and-more/) or read the latest [release notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/releases/2026/release-notes).
