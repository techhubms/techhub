# Practical Guidance: Launching Microsoft Secure Future Initiative Patterns and Practices

**Author:** stclarke

---

Microsoft has launched the **Secure Future Initiative (SFI) patterns and practices**, a curated library of actionable, implementation-focused guidance to help organizations and security practitioners bolster security across their environments at scale.

## Overview: Making Security Learnings Practical

The SFI patterns and practices initiative builds upon Microsoft's ongoing security investments and insights garnered from operating at global scale. The library embodies the company’s commitment to making the SFI learnings accessible and actionable for customers, partners, and the broader security ecosystem. These resources distill proven security architectures and best practices—including Zero Trust—into operational guidance adapted from Microsoft’s experience protecting its own infrastructure.

#### Key Principles

Since the [Secure Future Initiative](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative) launched in November 2023, Microsoft has mobilized over 34,000 engineers to focus on risk mitigation and security improvements. Guided by three principles—**secure by design, by default, and in operations**—SFI has driven measurable changes in security culture, governance, and across six core engineering pillars. Microsoft aims to share not just strategic guidance, but detailed, repeatable implementation patterns.

## What’s in the First Release of SFI Patterns and Practices?

The initial library release features eight patterns tackling urgent and recurring security challenges:

| Pattern Name | SFI Pillar | What it Helps You Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://aka.ms/SFI_Phishing-resistantMFA) | Protecting identities and secrets | Transition from vulnerable MFA to cryptographic, phishing-resistant methods (FIDO2, passkeys, certificate-based) for stronger credential security. |
| [Eliminate identity lateral movement](https://aka.ms/SFI_Eliminatelateralmovement) | Isolating tenants and production systems | Segment access, enforce Conditional Access, and block risky authentication to prevent privilege escalation and lateral movement. |
| [Remove legacy systems that risk security](https://aka.ms/SFI_Removelegacysystemsthatrisksecurity) | Isolating tenants and production systems | Decommission unmanaged tenants and outdated infrastructure to reduce attack surface and configuration drift. |
| [Standardize secure development pipelines](https://aka.ms/SFI_Standardizesecuredevelopmentpipelines) | Protecting engineering systems | Enforce secure, compliant CI/CD templates, encourage Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), and streamline development compliance. |
| [Complete production infrastructure inventory](https://aka.ms/SFI_Completeproductioninfrastructure) | Monitoring and detecting threats | Build real-time asset inventories, centralize telemetry, and remove unused apps for improved visibility and risk management. |
| [Rapid anomaly detection and response](https://aka.ms/SFI_Rapidanomalydetectionandresponse) | Monitoring and detecting threats | Use AI and user/entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to detect suspicious activity and automate incident response, boosting SOC efficiency. |
| [Security log retention standards](https://aka.ms/SFI_Securitylogretentionstandards) | Monitoring and detecting threats | Standardize and extend log retention, centralize access, and support long-term investigations/compliance. |
| [Accelerate vulnerability mitigation](https://aka.ms/SFI_Acceleratevulnerabilitymitigation) | Accelerating response and remediation | Automate detection, triage, communications, and patching to shorten mitigation timelines and strengthen resilience. |

## Structure: A Modular Approach to Security Practices

The SFI patterns and practices library is modeled after software design patterns, providing repeatable and modular solutions for complex cybersecurity problems. Each pattern is:

- **Pattern Name:** A concise, descriptive handle
- **Problem:** Security risk context and relevance
- **Solution:** Microsoft's internal solution approach
- **Guidance:** Practical steps for customers
- **Implications:** Benefits and trade-offs for implementation

![Taxonomy diagram for SFI patterns and practices.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Picture2-4.webp)

This structure ensures patterns are practical, adaptable, and grounded in real-world operational experience.

## Why SFI Patterns and Practices Matter

Organizations face growing and evolving cybersecurity threats. SFI patterns are designed to:

- Translate high-level strategy into actionable steps
- Accelerate security maturity and reduce implementation friction
- Illuminate real-world context, operational trade-offs, and measurable outcomes
- Promote security that is **by design, by default, and in operations**

## What’s Next?

Microsoft will continue to expand the SFI patterns and practices library, sharing new patterns aligned with SFI pillars over time. Future updates will be available on the [Microsoft Security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/topic/secure-future-initiative/) and the [SFI homepage](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative).
