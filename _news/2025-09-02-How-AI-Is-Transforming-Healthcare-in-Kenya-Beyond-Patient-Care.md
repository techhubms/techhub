# How AI Is Transforming Healthcare in Kenya: Beyond Patient Care

*By Phyllis Migwi, Country Manager, Microsoft Kenya*

Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming integral to daily life and is set to deliver substantial impact in healthcare, enabling differentiated solutions adapted to unique local ecosystems. AI in healthcare is not just about improved technology in hospitals; it’s about redefining what's possible across the entire chain—from manufacturing and delivery to decision-making and system-wide efficiency.

## Transforming Healthcare in Kenya

Access to affordable, quality healthcare remains a challenge, especially in rural and remote areas. AI offers ways to bridge these gaps by unlocking data-driven insights, supporting intelligent decision systems, and enabling workflow automation—leading to better outcomes and equitable, high-quality care. Studies indicate that widespread adoption of digital tools, including AI, could result in significant healthcare savings, with these efficiencies reinvested to improve access and resource allocation.

## The Role of Infrastructure

Modern AI adoption requires robust infrastructure. Reliable electricity and connectivity form the foundation for running advanced technologies such as datacentres essential for AI-driven services. Microsoft and other cloud providers are investing in Africa's digital ecosystem, building enterprise-grade datacentres that make local AI innovation possible and practical.

Robust data collection is equally essential. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical data gaps in Africa’s healthcare system, leading to underestimation of excess deaths. Investments in better data infrastructure are driving new opportunities to harness AI for public health and improved care delivery.

## Building Digital Skills for Healthcare AI

A skilled workforce is crucial for successful AI adoption. Kenya’s Africa Centre of Competence for Digital and Artificial Intelligence Skilling, under the National Digital Master Plan 2022-2032, is working to train 300,000 public servants. Such initiatives, alongside public-private partnerships, are targeting skills gaps, promoting digital literacy, and connecting learning to employment, especially in underserved areas.

Microsoft and other tech companies support these programs, helping scale efforts and maximise the impact of AI in healthcare service delivery.

## Economic and Social Impact

The benefits of AI in healthcare go beyond patient outcomes. AI-driven advances have the potential to reshape Kenya’s economy by enabling a healthy, productive young population. Bridging infrastructure and skills gaps will help unlock AI’s ability to revolutionise healthcare delivery, accelerate innovation, and reduce costs.

## Conclusion

Partnership, infrastructure, and digital skills development are all vital for realising AI’s full potential in healthcare. Through coordinated efforts and continued investment, Kenya can build a healthier and more prosperous future powered by AI.
