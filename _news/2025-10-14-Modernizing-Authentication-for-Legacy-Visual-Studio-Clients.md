Angel Wong outlines key security improvements and modernization efforts for legacy Visual Studio client authentication, urging developers to upgrade to supported tools to ensure continued secure access.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Modernizing Authentication for Legacy Visual Studio Clients

**Author:** Angel Wong

Microsoft is updating authentication mechanisms used by older Visual Studio and Azure DevOps clients. This change is part of an ongoing security and modernization initiative. Older clients that rely on legacy Visual Studio client libraries and outdated authentication flows will need to update to supported clients or tools to maintain secure access.

## Summary of Changes

- **Legacy tokens** are being replaced with modern, Entra-backed authentication in supported clients.
- This shift aligns with current identity standards and enhances security, but may require more frequent reauthentication due to the 1-hour lifetime of Entra tokens.
- Impacted clients and full details are available in the official announcement ([End of Support for Microsoft products reliant on older Azure DevOps and Visual Studio authentication](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/end-of-support-for-microsoft-products-reliant-on-older-azure-devops-authentication/)).
- Microsoft emphasizes that many legacy clients are past end-of-support and will not receive further compatibility updates for old authentication flows.

## What Developers Should Do

- **Upgrade** to supported versions of clients and tools to leverage modern authentication and security improvements.
- Expect additional interactive prompts when using Entra tokens, as part of improved identity management.
- Review the official documentation for impacted products and migration guidance.

## Background & Rationale

- The removal of deprecated authentication standards is driven by the need to improve overall security posture and keep pace with evolving identity requirements.
- Entra-backed authentication offers better protection against modern threats and streamlines user management across Microsoft services.

## Key Takeaways

- Plan and execute upgrades for any legacy Visual Studio or Azure DevOps clients in your development environment.
- Prepare for possible changes in sign-in workflows due to shorter token lifetimes.
- Stay current with Microsoft's security recommendations to reduce organizational risk.
