Allison reports on a new enhancement to the GitHub Copilot user management API, introducing a last_authenticated_at timestamp for tracking user authentication directly through the API.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub Copilot User Management API Adds last_authenticated_at Field

GitHub has updated the [Copilot user management API](https://docs.github.com/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-all-copilot-seat-assignments-for-an-organization) to include the `last_authenticated_at` field. This new attribute provides the UTC timestamp reflecting the most recent authentication event for a Copilot user.

Previously, organizations could only retrieve this information from the activity report CSV export, which often made tracking real-time user activity cumbersome. By exposing `last_authenticated_at` directly through the API, GitHub delivers feature parity and simplifies programmatic access to user authentication data. Importantly, the update does not change the existing API schema in any breaking way.

**Key Points:**

- `last_authenticated_at` is now available via the Copilot user management API
- Returns the UTC timestamp of each userâ€™s most recent authentication
- Previously only accessible in the activity report CSV
- The API update brings greater convenience for administrators managing large Copilot deployments
- No breaking changes were introduced
