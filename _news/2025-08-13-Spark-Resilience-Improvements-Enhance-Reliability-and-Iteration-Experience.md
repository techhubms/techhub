# Spark Resilience Improvements

**Author:** Allison  
**Source:** [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-13-spark-resilience-improvements)

### Overview

This release introduces several enhancements focused on making Spark more robust and developer-friendly. The improvements target reliability during iterative development, particularly in how files and data are handled.

### Key Improvements

- **Iteration Panel Filtering:**
  - The Iteration panel now accurately excludes in-transit files, which previously led to confusion during development iterations.
  - Developers will only see files relevant to their current iteration, streamlining focus and boosting productivity.

- **Data Store Resilience:**
  - The Spark data store is now better equipped to handle API failures and other interruption scenarios gracefully.
  - Users are assured to see the latest version of their data, reducing potential development delays or inconsistencies.

### Impact

These updates enhance the stability and clarity of the Spark experience, making development iterations smoother and less error-prone for application creators.

### Get Started
