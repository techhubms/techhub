# GitHub Copilot for Azure (Preview) Launches in Visual Studio 2022 with Azure MCP Support

**Author:** Yun Jung Choi

## Overview

GitHub Copilot for Azure is now available in Public Preview as an extension for Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.14+). This extension integrates a curated set of Azure developer tools, exposed through the Azure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, directly into Copilot's Agent Mode interface inside Visual Studio. Its seamless installation means the MCP server is automatically managed, enabling convenient access to Azure resources and tools within Copilot Chat.

## Key Features

- **Zero-setup Azure MCP server**: The extension automates installation and updates for the Azure MCP server, requiring no manual setup.
- **Agent Mode integration:** Use Copilot Agent Mode to select appropriate Azure tools for common tasks. You can choose from a toolbox for operations like querying resources, diagnosing issues, fetching logs, deploying with azd, and running Azure CLI commands.
- **Comprehensive Azure coverage:** The extension brings support for a wide range of Azure services, such as:
  - App Configuration
  - Azure Best Practices
  - Azure CLI Extension
  - Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  - Azure Cosmos DB
  - Azure Data Explorer
  - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  - Developer CLI (azd)
  - Azure Functions
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Azure SQL Database and Elastic Pools
  - Azure Storage
  - And more (see [full list](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp/blob/main/docs/azmcp-commands.md))
