Microsoft Fabric Blog introduces the integration of Copy Job with the Virtual Network Data Gateway, enabling secure, high-performance, and private data movement for enterprises handling sensitive workloads.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Secure Your Data Movement with Copy Job and Virtual Network Data Gateway

In an era of increasing data breaches, secure data transfer is mission-critical for organizations in regulated industries. Microsoft Fabric now enables Copy Job to work natively with the Virtual Network (VNET) Data Gateway, making private, high-performance data movement seamless and secure.

## Why Security-First Data Movement Matters

Many enterprises store mission-critical data inside private networks for industries such as finance, healthcare, and government. Transferring this data for analytics, machine learning, or reporting without exposing it to the public internet is often challenging and risky. Typical obstacles include the need for open public endpoints, complicated VPN setups, and performance bottlenecks from indirect network routes.

The VNET Data Gateway addresses these problems by serving as a secure bridge between private data sources and Microsoft Fabric. With this integration, Copy Job can securely move data without ever leaving your private network perimeter.

## How the Integration Works

1. **Gateway Inside Your VNET**: Install and configure the VNET Data Gateway inside your Azure Virtual Network.
2. **Direct, Private Connection**: All Copy Job data transfers are routed through the gateway, ensuring they remain within your internal network.
3. **No Public Exposure**: Data never traverses the public internet, reducing attack surface and meeting compliance needs.

## Key Benefits

- **End-to-End Security**: Sensitive data stays protected within your own network.
- **High Performance**: Utilize private endpoints or ExpressRoute for faster and more reliable data transfers.
- **Operational Simplicity**: The integration works with existing Copy Job configurations, requiring no steep learning curve.

## Getting Started

- [VNET Data Gateway setup guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/data-integration/vnet/create-data-gateways?toc=%2Ffabric%2Fdata-factory%2Ftoc.json) for configuring your environment
- [Copy Job creation tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/create-copy-job) within Fabric with VNET Data Gateway as your source connection
- Start migrating or integrating your data securely and compliantlyâ€”without sacrificing speed or manageability

Combing Copy Job with the VNET Data Gateway enables organizations to move data privately and efficiently using Microsoft Fabric, supporting secure analytics and machine learning workflows.
