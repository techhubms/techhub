# GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code Gets Upgraded

**Author:** Dylan Birtolo

Recently announced at GitHub Universe 2025, a series of enhancements are now available to developers using [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/), focused on advancing the GitHub Copilot experience.

## What's New

- **OpenAI Codex Integration:**
  - GitHub Copilot in VS Code Insiders now supports integration with OpenAI Codex for users with a Copilot Pro+ subscription. This enables advanced code completion and generative AI capabilities natively within the editor. [Learn more.](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/openai-codex?utm_source=changelog-docs-vs-code-updates&amp;utm_medium=changelog&amp;utm_campaign=universe25)

- **Agent Sessions View:**
  - A new unified interface allows developers to manage both local and cloud agent sessions conveniently. This centralized view simplifies tracking and switching between agent contexts.

- **Context-Isolated Sub-Agents:**
  - Subagents make it possible to delegate specific, focused tasks—like running test-driven development (TDD) workflows or conducting code research—independent of the primary chat. This feature aims to optimize token use and streamline isolated processes.

- **Plan Mode:**
  - Plan Mode introduces an automated, step-by-step implementation planner. By analyzing the current codebase, it generates detailed execution plans that can be refined and validated to ensure all requirements are met before any coding begins.

## Getting the Update

The VS Code Insiders build can be installed alongside the stable release, giving access to the latest features without impacting regular workflows. Simply open VS Code Insiders and navigate to **Help → Check for Updates** to ensure you have the most recent version.
