Allison explains how GitHub's Dependabot now supports excluding dependency manifests in chosen subdirectories, making it easier for teams to control update noise in monorepos and refine DevOps automation.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Suppress Dependabot PRs in Specific Subdirectories with `exclude-paths`

Dependabot's latest update introduces the `exclude-paths` option in your `dependabot.yml` file, letting you exclude certain folders or files—either explicitly or via glob patterns—so that dependency manifests in those paths are ignored.

## Key Features

- **Exclude Directories or Files:** Prevents dependency update pull requests for manifests in designated subdirectories.
- **Glob Pattern Support:** Specify complex exclusion rules using patterns like `*` and `**`.
- **Per-Ecosystem Tailoring:** Use exclusion rules in each `updates` block to fine-tune behavior for different package managers or languages.
- **Works for Large Repositories:** Especially helpful for monorepos with multiple project types, sample code, test fixtures, or experimental sections.

## Practical Impact

Prior to this feature, users had to list out every included directory or accept unwanted PR noise. Now, you can:

- Use a single, broad directory pattern (e.g., `directory: "/"`)
- Exclude areas like `examples/`, `samples/`, and archived code
- Minimize distraction and manual triage of unnecessary PRs

## Usage Tips

- Exclusions are evaluated before parsing manifests, so ignored paths are not even scanned
- Exclusion does not replace dependency-level `ignore` rules
- For overlapping `updates` blocks, each block's exclusions apply independently
- Grouping only applies to included (not excluded) manifests

## Security & Compliance Considerations

Excluding directories means updates for dependencies present only in those locations will not be surfaced. Ensure that paths you exclude are non-production or intentionally unmanaged to avoid missing important security updates.

## Rollout

- **GitHub.com:** Available immediately
- **GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES):** Shipping in version 3.19
