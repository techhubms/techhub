# Copilot Agent Mode Now Generally Available with MCP Support

*By Rhea Patel, Filisha Shah, and Allie Barry*

## Overview

The latest Visual Studio June update introduces the next evolution in AI-assisted development: **Copilot agent mode**. Now generally available, this feature transforms GitHub Copilot from a conversational assistant into a fully autonomous pair programmer, capable of executing multi-step development tasks from start to finish within Visual Studio.

## Key Features of Agent Mode

- **End-to-End Task Automation:** Agent mode can analyze your codebase, generate detailed plans, apply code changes, respond to build and lint errors, run command-line operations, and self-correct as needed, iterating through tasks until completion.
- **Active Autonomy:** Unlike Ask Mode, where developers guide Copilot interactively, Agent Mode executes entire goals independently, while still providing editable previews, undo options, and a live action feed for user oversight.
- **Multi-Context Understanding:** The more detailed the prompt, the more effective agent mode becomes. It works best when provided with clear goals and full contextual information.

### Example Use Cases

Agent mode is ideal for:

- Adding new features such as, “Add ‘buy now’ functionality to my product page.”
- Implementing robust patterns, e.g., “Add a retry mechanism to this API call with exponential backoff and a unit test.”
- Generating boilerplate code or scaffolding applications, such as, “Create a new Blazor web app that does X.”

## How to Access Agent Mode in Visual Studio

1. Open **Copilot Chat**.
2. Click the **Ask** button.
3. Switch to **Agent** mode.

## Tool Calling and Ecosystem Expansion

At the core of agent mode is **tool calling**:

- Agent mode selects and executes from a growing set of tools directly inside Visual Studio, accessible via a tool dropdown menu in Copilot Chat.
- The system is extensible; you can add custom tools to further expand its capabilities with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). [Learn about adding MCP tools](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/mcptools.png).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

MCP offers a standardized, open-source protocol for connecting AI agents with external tools and services:

- **Native support in Visual Studio** through the `mcp.json` configuration file, also compatible with environments like `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- Agents can now access resources beyond code—such as GitHub repositories, CI/CD pipelines, telemetry/monitoring systems, and more, using MCP bridge servers.
- [Official MCP server repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

### Practical Examples of MCP Use

- With the GitHub MCP server, the agent can manage issues, review repo history, and perform searches programmatically.
- Integrating with Figma via MCP enables the agent to access design mockups within your workflow.
- Support for other external tools and systems is possible, making agent mode highly adaptable.

## Empowering Developers with AI

Agent mode is designed to improve real-world productivity:

- Developers remain in full control, with Copilot providing suggestions, previews, and the ability to revert changes.
- Enhanced autonomy empowers teams to move faster while maintaining code quality and oversight.
- Continuous feedback and logs are encouraged to further enhance agent mode’s evolution ([Share feedback](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/home)).

## Additional AI Features in the Visual Studio June Release

Alongside agent mode, several new AI-related capabilities debut in this update:

- **Prompt File Sharing:** Teams can now create and use reusable markdown prompt files directly in their repositories, streamlining prompt reuse within Copilot Chat.
- **Access to New AI Models:** Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 models are now supported, offering advanced reasoning and code generation capabilities.
- **Output Window Referencing:** Integrate the Output Window context to facilitate more effective runtime troubleshooting.
- **Copilot Usage Monitoring:** Directly track your Copilot usage within Visual Studio.
- **Agents Toolkit 17.14 GA:** General availability for this toolkit brings improvements for building Microsoft 365 apps and intelligent agents.
