# Unlocking Enterprise-Ready SQL Database Features in Microsoft Fabric: ALM, Backups, and Copilot Enhancements

Coauthored by: Joanne Wong

## Introduction

Microsoft Fabric continues to evolve as a unified data platform. The most recent updates to SQL Database in Fabric transform it into a fully managed SaaS offering, introducing features that prioritize security, developer flexibility, and productivity. This article summarizes the most impactful enhancements.

---

## Copilot & Query Editor Enhancements

- **SSMS One-Click Connection**: Instantly connect to SQL Database in Fabric via both VS Code integration and SQL Server Management Studio, reducing setup friction for developers and data professionals.
- **Bulk Query Management**: Easily manage and delete multiple queries within the workspace using intuitive selection and actions.
- **Shared Queries**: Support for collaborative query editing and sharing across workspace teams.
- **Copilot Mode Selector**: Toggle quickly between 'read-only' mode (Copilot suggests SQL but does not execute) and 'read/write' mode (Copilot can execute code after user approval), enhancing safe automation and governance.

---

## Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)

- **Database Definition Import/Export via REST API**: Developers can now export database object definitions as portable SQL projects and import compiled definitions (e.g., dacpacs) with automated diff detection and application of changes.

---

## VS Code Integration

- **MSSQL Extension for VS Code**: Seamless connectivity between VS Code and Fabric SQL databases via the official MSSQL extension. Browse, authenticate, and connect with Microsoft Entra ID-based persistent sign-in.
- **Provisioning Workflows**: Create and connect Fabric SQL databases directly from VS Code in under three minutes, supporting rapid development and prototyping.

**Additional Resources**:

---

## Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)

- **Granular Database Recovery**: Restore any Fabric SQL database to a specific time within either a 7-day or (now) 35-day retention window. Supports recovery from errors, bugs, or security incidents.

---

## Performance Dashboard Improvements

- **Memory Consumption Metrics**: Real-time monitoring of memory usage by individual queries, alongside existing metrics like CPU utilization, user connections, requests per second, blocked queries, database size, automatic index info, and overall performance.
- [Performance Dashboard documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/database/sql/performance-dashboard)

---

## Mirroring/Replication Configurability

- **Programmatic Replication Control**: Teams can start or stop data replication/mirroring to Fabric OneLake via REST APIs, supporting automated pipeline management and operational resilience.

---

## Upcoming: SQL Auditing

- **Enterprise Compliance and Security**: Built-in auditing logs all critical events by default (logins, schema changes, permissions) in an immutable OneLake folder.
- **Custom Auditing Configurations**: Fine-grained audit options allow organizations to tailor events, retention, and predicates for compliance.
