Angel Wong announces important authentication updates for Azure DevOps, moving away from Azure Resource Manager dependence for Entra sign-ins. This guide helps administrators prepare for the coming changes in Conditional Access requirements.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Removing Azure Resource Manager Reliance on Azure DevOps Sign-ins

**Author:** Angel Wong

Azure DevOps will no longer depend on the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) resource (`https://management.azure.com`) when users sign in or refresh Microsoft Entra access tokens. Previously, ARM acted as a required audience for these processes, forcing administrators to ensure that all Azure DevOps users met ARM-based Conditional Access policies to maintain access.

### What’s Changing?

- **ARM audience is no longer required for Azure DevOps tokens.**
- Administrators can now create Conditional Access policies that specifically target Azure DevOps, rather than depending on ARM-based enforcement to manage Azure DevOps access.
- **Timeline:**
  - These changes come into effect on **July 28, 2025** and **September 2, 2025**.

### Does This Change Affect Me?

If you previously set up a Conditional Access policy specifically for the [Windows Azure Service Management API application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps#windows-azure-service-management-api), be aware:

- **This policy will no longer cover Azure DevOps sign-ins.**
- You must create a new Azure DevOps-exclusive Conditional Access policy to continue enforcing access for ADO users.

### Creating a Conditional Access Policy for Azure DevOps

As a tenant admin, use [Conditional Access policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview) to grant or block user access to Azure resources based on conditions such as:

- Accepted IP addresses
- Membership in specific Entra groups
- Use of recognized devices
- Completion of multifactor authentication

**To create a policy for Azure DevOps:**

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to **Microsoft Entra Conditional Access**.
2. Select **Policies** in the sidebar.
3. Click **+ New policy**.
4. Name your policy and configure other desired settings.
5. Under **Target resources**, choose **Select resources**, and add **“Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services”** or **“Azure DevOps”** (resource id: `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798`) as targets.
6. Click **Save** to enforce the new policy.

Explore further Conditional Access policy options and recommendations in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/).

### Notable Exceptions

Some users will continue to require access to ARM:

- **Billing administrators:** Need ARM to set up billing and access subscriptions.
- **Service Connection creators:** Require ARM for role assignments and updates to managed service identities (MSIs).

**Summary:**

- Azure DevOps is removing its dependency on ARM resources for sign-in and token refresh.
- Administrators should proactively update Conditional Access policies to explicitly secure Azure DevOps usage.
- Plan these changes ahead of the enforcement dates to avoid access issues for your users.
