# Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 Now Available for GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

GitHub Copilot coding agent, an asynchronous agent designed for developers, now supports Claude Sonnet 4.5—Anthropic’s latest and most advanced large language model for coding and real-world applications.

Claude Sonnet 4.5 offers improved coding capabilities and has achieved state-of-the-art results on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation, which tests real-world software engineering abilities.

**Availability Details:**

- **Copilot Pro & Pro+ users**: The agent will automatically use Claude Sonnet 4.5.
- **Copilot Business & Enterprise users**: Administrators must enable the Claude Sonnet 4.5 policy in Copilot settings. Without enabling, the coding agent defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.
