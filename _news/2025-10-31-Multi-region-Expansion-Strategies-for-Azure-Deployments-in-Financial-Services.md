# Multi-region Expansion Strategies for Azure Deployments in Financial Services

Financial services organizations are increasingly leveraging Azure's expansive network of regions to unlock new capabilities and support evolving business and regulatory demands. This guide presents key reasons and actionable insights for adopting a multi-region Azure deployment strategy.

## Beyond Resiliency: Business Enablement through Multi-region Deployment

- **Resiliency and Disaster Recovery:** Multi-region strategies elevate disaster recovery and business continuity. Organizations can withstand regional outages by distributing critical workloads.
- **Operational Flexibility:** By utilizing over 60 Azure regions, organizations refine resource allocation and achieve greater elasticity, ensuring efficient deployment and scaling across different geographies.
- **Future-proofing with Azure Landing Zones:** Establishing Azure Landing Zones in strategic regions prepares organizations to deploy efficiently as user bases expand or shift.

## Regulatory Compliance and Data Residency

- **Compliance Demands:** Financial organizations must navigate strict regulations around data residency, privacy, and security, especially in markets like the EU.
- **Azure's Coverage:** With dedicated regional capabilities, including GDPR-enabled zones and the EU Data Boundary, Azure empowers customers to meet local and international compliance standards.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Building architectures with strong data residency considerations strengthens organizational reputation for security and compliance.

## Cost Optimization and Sustainability

- **Cost Savings:** Certain Azure regions (e.g., Central US) offer lower total cost of ownership. Choosing newer, less congested regions can lead to noticeable savings on compute, storage, and services.
- **Sustainability:** Azure regions like Central US and Sweden Central benefit from Microsoft's sustainability investments, offering options for carbon-neutral operations, helping organizations align with environmental commitments.

## Performance, Resiliency, and AI Enablement

- **Enhanced Performance:** Deploying workloads closer to end-users reduces latency and improves customer experiences.
- **Geographic Resiliency:** Distributing solutions across regions helps organizations withstand local incidents, enhancing operational uptime.
- **AI and Data Initiatives:** Multi-region strategies facilitate scalable data processing and machine learning. Data and AI teams can centralize processing, perform federated learning, and leverage Azure's robust network for model inference and compliance.

## Recommended Regions and Practical Guidance

### For US-based Financial Institutions

- **Central US** is highlighted for:
    - Low latency and broad North American reach
    - Capacity and availability zones for mission-critical workloads
    - Cost efficiencies and discounts
    - Regulatory certifications (PCI, SOC, ISO)
    - Scaling advantage versus more saturated regions

### For EU-based Organizations

- **Regional Selection:** Policy updates (e.g., in West Europe, Netherlands) require proactive Azure region selection aligned with regulatory changes.
- **Consultation Advised:** Engage Microsoft Account Teams for bespoke guidance.

## Incentives and Support

Microsoft supports multi-region adopters with guidance, resources, and capacity planning assistance. Contacting an Azure Sales Specialist can unlock further support opportunities.

## Conclusion

Expanding to multiple Azure regions is a strategic move—one that strengthens resiliency, compliance, and cost-effectiveness, and positions financial services organizations for sustainable, innovation-driven growth.
