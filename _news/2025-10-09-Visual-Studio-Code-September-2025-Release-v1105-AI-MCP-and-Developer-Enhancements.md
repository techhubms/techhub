## Major Highlights

### AI and Chat Improvements

- **AI-Powered Merge Conflict Resolution**: Use chat agents to resolve git merge conflicts directly in the editor with guidance and automation.
- **Enhanced Chat Sessions**: Improvements to managing multiple chat sessions with both local and remote coding agents, including session history, UI streamlining, and more robust OS notifications for responses and task completions.
- **Chat Mode Customization:** Support for nested `AGENTS.md` files for customized chat agent behavior in different workspace folders.
- **Chain-of-Thought Debugging:** Experimental feature shows reasoning tokens for AI chat responses, aiding transparency and debugging.
- **Improved Edit Tools for Custom Models:** Greater support for BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) OpenAI-compatible models and tailored tool sets in chat.

### GitHub Copilot & Agent Tools

- **GitHub Copilot Enhancements:** Expanded capabilities for Copilot Chat, custom model configuration (`github.copilot.chat.customOAIModels`), and support for Apple account sign-in.
- **Disallow Whitespace-only Edit Suggestions:** Avoid trivial next edit suggestions in Copilot (

`github.copilot.nextEditSuggestions.allowWhitespaceOnlyChanges`).

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Marketplace

- **MCP Marketplace (Preview):** New built-in marketplace lets developers browse and install MCP servers from the Extensions view, powered by the GitHub MCP registry.
- **Autostart and Improved MCP server handling:** Automatic server startup and new capabilities for icons and tool/resource representations via MCP specification updates.

### DevOps and Source Control

- **Source Control Integration:** Improved file context for chat, better PR and issue support with the GitHub Pull Requests extension, and AI-powered merge resolution.
- **Terminal Improvements:** Enhanced terminal profile configuration, agent-specific shells, and auto-reply capabilities to speed up automated flows.
- **Task and Notification Upgrades:** OS notifications for long-running task completion, improved terminal title persistence, and easier navigation with shortcuts.

### Testing & Language Support

- **Run Tests with Code Coverage:** Chat agents can now access code coverage data via the `runTests` tool, allowing for comprehensive testing and validation.
- **Python-Test Enhancements:** New UI for copying test IDs, improving Python workflow within the editor.

### Security and Authentication

- **macOS Native Broker for Microsoft Authentication:** Modernizes sign-in experience for ARM-based Macs and Intune-enrolled devices, with fallback options and extended MSAL support.
- **GitHub PKCE Support:** Secure authentication flow for GitHub sign-in.
- **MFA Enforcement API:** Support for WWW-Authenticate claims challenges for extensions interacting with Azure resources.

### Accessibility, Customization, and Extensions

- **Screen Reader Support:** Better accessibility with improved announcements and view persistence; shell integration enhancements for `pwsh` under screen readers.
- **Quick Input Shortcut Customization:** Reassign keybindings for Quick Pick and Input Box controls.
- **Secret Storage API Enhancements:** Extensions can now list and manage secret storage keys programmatically.

## Detailed Changes

### AI-Powered Productivity

- Merge conflict resolution, task completion, and code reviews are now more efficient with automated AI and agent capabilities.
- Copilot Chat continues to expand with more customization, agentic flows, and direct support for multiple language models (

GPT-5-Codex, Claude Sonnet 4.5).

- Chain-of-thought reasoning and session-based chat history simplify code understanding and debugging.

### DevOps and Automation

- Better CI/CD integration with improved task completion feedback, agent loops, and code/action automations.
- Terminal settings now allow for separation of agent shells and user environments.
- Source control graph and testing interfaces are enhanced for rapid feedback and traceability.

### MCP and Extension Ecosystem

- Extension developers gain new APIs for secret storage, MFA claims challenges, chat prompt/instructions contributions, and better test/telemetry integration.
- MCP servers can now expose custom icons, provide default values for elicitation, and be more seamlessly deployed across teams through the new marketplace preview.

### Contributor Acknowledgments

- The team recognizes dozens of external contributors for pull requests across VS Code and its critical extensions, reflecting a vibrant, collaborative open-source community.
