# Democratizing AI in Africa: Fastagger and Microsoft Enable On-Device AI for SMBs

Africa’s economic growth hinges on closing the digital divide and providing broad access to digital economies. A significant barrier is the lack of widespread, reliable infrastructure—many regions in Africa still contend with expensive data and outdated 2G/3G devices. Traditional AI and cloud solutions, often demanding stable connections and high-performance hardware, do not suit these contexts.

## Fastagger’s On-Device AI Solution

Deep tech startup Fastagger has responded by building AI models optimized to run directly on low-power, affordable smartphones. Their infrastructure operates at the edge without constant internet or cloud reliance, making advanced software available to rural, peri-urban, and bandwidth-constrained environments.

### Real-World Impact

- **Healthcare:** Rural clinics use offline diagnostics and monitoring tools.
- **Education:** Teachers and students access AI-powered learning resources, even in low-resource schools.
- **Agriculture/Energy:** Workers use predictive maintenance and smart agriculture tools without connectivity.

## Empowering Small Businesses

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) anchor Africa’s economy. Many depend on mobile money—over half the global market is African. However, most SMBs juggle manual, inefficient customer management. Fastagger’s mobile-based AI SaaS business assistant automates customer intelligence, engagement, and business coaching, at a price point SMBs can afford.

- **Key Features:**
  - Simplified customer reward and retention workflows
  - AI-driven analytics for promotions and loyalty programs
  - Dashboards for transactions and credit-based loyalty
- **Economic Upside:** Just a 5% increase in customer retention boosts profitability 25-95%.

## Microsoft’s Role: Enabling AI at Scale

Microsoft, through the Africa Transformation Office, offered Fastagger comprehensive support—technical mentorship and access to Azure AI, IoT, and GitHub. This enables rapid development from concept to deployment. Fastagger also benefited from partnerships with NVIDIA GenAI and Cloudmania for enterprise scaling.

### Case Study: The AUNI System

The AUNI system, Fastagger’s AI tool for SMBs, is integrated into Safaricom’s M-PESA Business App and serves thousands of micro and small enterprises across entry-level Android devices. With Microsoft support and NVIDIA’s accelerator, Fastagger gives any Azure enterprise access to edge AI infrastructure, turning the startup into a global player.

> “Using the AUNI system has allowed us to effectively manage and track customer interactions, streamline marketing, and gain better data organisation—including visual analytics and data-driven decision-making.” – Sharon Njoroge, Mandevu

## Conclusion

By powering local solutions with on-device AI, Fastagger—with Microsoft’s backing—is bringing transformative digital services to millions in Africa. The partnership demonstrates how appropriately designed technology and mentorship can democratize economic opportunity, even where infrastructure is limited.
