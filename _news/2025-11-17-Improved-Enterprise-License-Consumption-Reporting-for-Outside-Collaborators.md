# Improved Enterprise License Consumption Reporting for Outside Collaborators

GitHub has enhanced its enterprise licensing CSV export functionality to assist enterprises in monitoring license usage by outside collaborators. This update is especially valuable for enterprise owners and billing managers tasked with managing budgets and compliance across multiple organizations.

## What's New?

- **Explicit Organization Association:** Outside collaborators are now explicitly associated with the organization(s) they contribute to in the license report export.
- **Detailed Member Roles Column:** The `member roles` column of the CSV export will now display outside collaborator entries in the format `[org]/[repo]`, making it clear which organization and repository the collaborator is linked with.

## Why the Change?

This improvement simplifies the process of identifying which outside collaborators are consuming enterprise licenses. It's particularly beneficial as enterprises scale and need to manage license consumption transparently across a network of organizations and teams.

- [GitHub Community Announcement](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements)

## Impact

- Improved budget tracking for enterprise owners
- More efficient and accurate license auditing
- Easier identification of resource allocation to outside collaborators

For enterprise administrators, these enhancements reduce the guesswork in billing and license assignment, helping ensure that outside collaborator activity is accounted for during compliance reviews and financial planning.
