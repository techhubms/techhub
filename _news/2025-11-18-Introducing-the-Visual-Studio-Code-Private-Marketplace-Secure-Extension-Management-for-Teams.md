# Introducing the Visual Studio Code Private Marketplace: Secure Extension Management for Teams

*Author: Sean Iyer*

Version 1.106 of VS Code introduces the Private Marketplace functionality—a solution for organizations seeking central, secure, and compliant management of extensions for Visual Studio Code.

## Key Features

- **Curated Extension Catalogs**: Administrators can select which internal and public extensions are available to their developers, ensuring only vetted and trusted plugins are accessible.
- **Internal Extension Hosting**: Safeguard proprietary IP by privately hosting company-developed extensions, eliminating exposure outside the organizational firewall.
- **Centralized Deployment**: Roll out extensions and updates across teams so everyone has consistent access from day one, reducing setup and maintenance overhead.
- **Secure Public Extension Rehosting**: Organizations can rehost public extensions after their own compliance checks, supporting use in secure or air-gapped settings.
- **Integrated Experience**: Extension management remains natively within VS Code, so developers encounter familiar workflows without ticket-based installs or manual processes.

## Access Requirements

- Available to GitHub Enterprise customers.
- VS Code users need to authenticate with GitHub Enterprise or Copilot Business/Enterprise accounts to access Private Marketplace features.

## Getting Started

Begin by following the [deployment and feature guide](https://aka.ms/private-marketplace/readme), which includes instructions, scripts, and environment setup tips for teams and IT administrators.
