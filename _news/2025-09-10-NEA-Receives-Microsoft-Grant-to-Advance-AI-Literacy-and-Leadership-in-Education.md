# NEA Receives Microsoft Grant to Advance AI Literacy and Leadership in Education

**WASHINGTON — Sept. 10, 2025**

The National Education Association (NEA), the largest provider of education micro-credentials in the United States, has secured an initial $325,000 grant from Microsoft Elevate. This funding will help NEA expand efforts to support educators as they navigate both the opportunities and challenges that artificial intelligence (AI) brings to education. Crucially, the partnership will also enable educators to contribute feedback on the development of Microsoft’s AI tools.

> _“Our students and educators cannot be passive users; they must have agency with this technology and an appreciation for the uniquely human assets we bring to learning.”_ — Becky Pringle, NEA President

Brad Smith, Microsoft’s Vice Chair and President, highlighted that investing in AI literacy and leadership ensures educators and students remain central to the use of AI in classrooms.

**Key Initiatives from the Grant:**

- Engage 10,000 additional NEA members with new content and micro-credentials on AI
- Focus on AI policy and leadership development for NEA’s state affiliates
- Foster educator input into Microsoft’s AI tool design

Last year, NEA and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) ran an AI learning series reaching thousands of members. This new grant will build upon that success by further strengthening AI knowledge and fluency among educators and leaders.

The NEA’s recent policy statement emphasizes the importance of the educator-student relationship in the AI era, advocating for teacher and student agency in every education decision.
