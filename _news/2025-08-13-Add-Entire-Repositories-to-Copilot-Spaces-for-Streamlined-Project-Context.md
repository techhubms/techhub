# Add Entire Repositories to Copilot Spaces for Streamlined Project Context

GitHub Copilot Spaces now supports adding entire repositories, enabling developers to onboard quickly when working with unfamiliar codebases or when a project spans multiple files and directories.

## What’s New

- **Add Whole Repositories**: Quickly bring in all files from a repository to your Copilot Space, ensuring comprehensive context for AI-powered assistance.
- **Faster Onboarding**: Ideal for exploring codebases efficiently, especially when you aren’t sure which specific files to include.
- **Improved Feature Coverage**: Handles work that crosses file and directory boundaries, giving Copilot the full context it needs.
- **One-Click Setup**: Skip manual file selection by adding everything at once.

## How to Use

1. Open your Copilot Space and click **Add Sources**.
2. Choose **Add files and repositories**.
3. Select the repository you wish to incorporate.
4. On the file selection screen, click **Add repository**.

> **Pro Tip:** Copilot will index the entire repository for context. However, for most accurate results, it is still recommended to add specific files that are particularly important for your workflow. This helps Copilot surface the most relevant content during your sessions.

## Additional Improvements

- **Faster Navigation**: Jump into your spaces more quickly with new streamlined links from github.com/copilot.
- **Enhanced List Views**: Spaces are now easier to browse, with upgrades like search capabilities to help you find your workspaces faster.
- **Editable Details**: Titles and descriptions can now be changed directly from your space.
- **Unified Resources and Conversations**: All resources and discussions are housed in the same interface with simple tab navigation.
- **Updated Icons**: Improved visual cues for better usability and clarity.
