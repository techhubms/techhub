## What’s New in Azure AI Foundry — July 2025

**Author:** Nick Brady

Azure AI Foundry's July 2025 release introduces a range of significant improvements for AI developers on Microsoft Azure. This roundup outlines new AI agent capabilities, developer tools, SDK enhancements, platform features, and updated security measures.

---

### TL;DR

- **Deep Research Agent (Public Preview):** Automate complex, multi-step web research using OpenAI’s o3-deep-research model, now available through Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.
- **GPT-image-1 Model:** Adds `input_fidelity` parameter for controlling style preservation during image edits and partial image streaming for real-time visual previews.
- **AgentOps, Red Teaming, Tracing:** Improved agent monitoring, evaluation, and compliance tools help ensure reliability and security in production.
- **Platform & Security:** New pay-as-you-go compute, Prompt Shields (GA), Entra Agent ID, and Purview integration deliver secure, scalable AI deployments.
- **SDK & Documentation:** Major updates for Python, .NET, Java, and JavaScript SDKs; new guides for Deep Research and agent development.

## Models

### GPT-image-1 Model Enhancements (Preview)

- **Input Fidelity Parameter:** The new `input_fidelity` in the image edits API controls how much the original style and features are preserved during edits. This benefits photo editing (e.g., altering facial features, preserving avatars), brand identity, and product imagery.
- **Partial Image Streaming:** Users now receive progressive visual feedback as images are generated or edited, improving the editing workflow experience.
