## Azure Developer CLI (azd): June 2025 Release Summary

**Author:** Kristen Womack

### Overview

This post provides a comprehensive rundown of the June 2025 updates for the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), covering releases 1.16.0, 1.16.1, and 1.17.0. The updates focus on new alpha and beta features, extension capabilities, improvements in CI/CD integration, enhanced AI support, new and updated documents, and fresh templates to boost productivity for Azure developers.

### Community Engagement & Feedback

Readers are encouraged to participate in the [June release discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/discussions/5269) and provide input via a [Terraform and azd survey](https://forms.office.com/r/bg6XPYLEaS), reflecting growing community interest in enhancing Terraform support within `azd`.

## What's New

### Main Menu Reorganization

- Updated `azd` menu offers improved feature organization.
- New sections for beta and alpha commands are introduced to facilitate early experimentation.

### Extensions (Alpha Feature)

- New extension system available as an alpha feature, unlockable with `azd config set alpha.extensions on`.
- Build and integrate custom extensions tailored to specific developer workflows.
- Initial documentation:
  - [Overview of extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/extensions/overview)
  - [Quickstart for creating extensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/extensions/quickstart-ai-extension)

### Compose Feature Enhancements (Beta)

- The `azd add` and composability features are promoted to beta for new projects.
- Deprecated the `alpha.compose` feature.
- The new `azd infra generate` (alias: `azd infra gen`) command replaces `azd infra synth` for infrastructure code generation, now in beta.
- Users are encouraged to adopt new command patterns as older aliases will be phased out.

### Other Notable Features

- Support for Azure App Service in resource display commands.
- Azure AI Foundry hub now utilizes identity-based storage access for increased security.
- Enhanced pipeline config features:
  - Auto-detection of necessary variables and secrets from infrastructure parameters.
  - Interactive control for GitHub Actions variables/secrets during pipeline setup.
- Support for extension namespaces (hierarchical structuring).
- Aspire project single-service deployment via vs-server integrated.
- AI Foundry 1RP setup simplifies model management under AI Services.
- Homebrew formulas updated for Linux availability.
- Autoprompt/login guard middleware enhances CLI usability.
- CI/CD configuration improvements with Managed Identities.
- Bicep parameter prompting supports default selection with `--no-prompt`.

### Breaking Changes

- When initializing from app code/minimal projects, infra folders aren't generated by defaultâ€”`azd` manages infra in-memory unless code is explicitly generated.
- Environment initialization deferred to provision-time unless otherwise specified.
- Updates to AI Services models in `azd add` require a newer Azure AI Foundry SDK client library configuration for API/project endpoint usage.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevents duplicate resource entries with `azd add`.
- UX enhancements in resource previews and error messaging.
- Improvements in Bicep generation, Aspire project handling, container registry logins, and more.
- Vulnerability mitigation in Bicep CLI dependencies.

### Additional Improvements

- Enhanced `azd help` text organization.
- Refined environment name prompt messaging.
- Template initialization and project detection messaging is clarified.
- Internal registry extension deprecated in favor of developer extension.
- Dependency updates for CVE mitigation and overall code health.
