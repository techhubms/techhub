## New Features

### Enhanced Project Validation

- Improved project name validation prevents packaging failures caused by invalid characters, reducing deployment errors for developers. ([PR #5380](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5380))

### Generic OIDC Authentication Support

- Expanded authentication to include generic OIDC with any CI provider, enabling broader integration with various pipelines beyond default providers. ([PR #5397](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5397))

### Improved User Experience

- New confirmation prompt before setting a new environment as default avoids accidental environment switches. ([PR #4832](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/4832))

### Enhanced Metadata Support

- Boolean and integer default values now supported in azd metadata fields, increasing configuration flexibility. ([PR #5384](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5384))

### Metadata Field Regression Fix

- Fixed an issue where prompting for boolean or integer fields without defaults was not handled correctly. ([PR #5386](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5386))

### Deployment Packaging Improvements

- Support for `.webappignore` and `.funcignore` files allows selective exclusion of files from deployment packages, optimizing deployment performance. ([PR #5383](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5383))

### Interactive Hooks Enhancement

- `azd hooks run` now always runs in interactive mode with improved schema validation for easier debugging and development. ([PR #5430](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5430))

### Enhanced Environment Management

- `azd env set` accepts multiple key-value pairs for more efficient environment variable configuration. ([PR #4942](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/4942))
