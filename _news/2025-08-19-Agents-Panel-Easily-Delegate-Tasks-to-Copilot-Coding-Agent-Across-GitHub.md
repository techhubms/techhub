# Agents Panel: Easily Delegate Tasks to Copilot Coding Agent Across GitHub

GitHub has launched the Copilot coding agent, an autonomous developer agent that enables users to delegate coding tasks and let Copilot handle them in the background. This agent creates draft pull requests for review, integrating seamlessly into everyday development workflows.

## Key Features

- **Agents Panel**: Accessible from any page on GitHub.com via the Agents button in the header, next to the Copilot button. This panel allows for quick task delegation and progress monitoring.
- **Task Management**: See all delegated tasks with clear statuses and easily navigate to their respective pull requests.
- **Natural Language Input**: Describe desired tasks in plain English, select repository and base branch, and let Copilot draft solutions.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Monitor and manage Copilot-driven automation without interrupting coding flow.
