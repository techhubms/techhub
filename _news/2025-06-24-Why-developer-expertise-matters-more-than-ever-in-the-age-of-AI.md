In this article, Laura Lindeman explores how AI tools can accelerate coding but stresses that a developer’s true value lies in understanding why code works. <!--excerpt_end--> The article underscores that while AI greatly aids productivity by generating code snippets and automating routine tasks, developers must still comprehend core concepts and maintain strong analytical skills. Sharpening human-in-the-loop skills—such as debugging, reasoning about architecture, and verifying AI-generated suggestions—is essential for producing robust, maintainable software. Ultimately, blending AI efficiency with deep expertise leads to better software and more capable developers.
