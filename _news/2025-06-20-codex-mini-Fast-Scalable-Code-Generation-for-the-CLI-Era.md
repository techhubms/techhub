# codex-mini: Fast, Scalable Code Generation for the CLI Era

*Authors: Ananya Bishnoi, Anthony Mocny, Govind Kamtamneni*

Microsoft has announced the general availability of Azure OpenAI's codex-mini in Azure AI Foundry Models—a specialized, fine-tuned version of the o4-mini model designed for developer productivity in command-line interface (CLI) workflows.

## Overview of codex-mini

codex-mini is engineered to bring rapid, instruction-following performance to CLI environments. It enables developers to automate shell commands, edit scripts, refactor repositories, and streamline terminal workflows. Key features of codex-mini include:

- **Optimized for Speed**: Offers fast question-answering and code-editing with minimal overhead, ensuring efficient CLI automation.
- **Instruction-Following**: Builds on Codex-1's strengths in understanding natural language prompts, providing accurate, relevant shell commands and code snippets.
- **CLI-Native**: Directly interprets natural language inputs and returns results as shell commands or code.
- **Long Context Support**: Able to handle up to 200k-token input windows, making it suitable for ingesting and refactoring entire repositories.
- **Lightweight and Scalable**: Designed for cost-effective deployment, with a small capacity footprint to suit scalable applications.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Approximately 25% more cost-effective than GPT-4.1 for comparable input/output token workloads.
- **Codex CLI Compatibility**: Integrates seamlessly with the codex-cli tool, enhancing existing developer workflows.

*Pricing details for codex-mini and all Azure OpenAI models can be found on the [Azure OpenAI pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/).*

## Key Capabilities

codex-mini provides a set of developer-focused capabilities:

- **Streaming Outputs**: Real-time code generation as you type
- **Function Calling**: Automate and extend CLI behaviors
- **Structured Outputs**: Generate and consume code and results in organized formats
- **Image Input**: Supports multimodal workflows requiring code and image data

These features enable a wide range of scalable code generation tasks in command-line or terminal environments.

---

## Summary

Developers can now leverage codex-mini for fast, reliable, and cost-effective code generation directly within their terminal. With support for large contexts, instruction following, broad compatibility with existing tools, and cost efficiency, codex-mini represents a significant advancement in AI-supported CLI development on Microsoft’s Azure platform.
