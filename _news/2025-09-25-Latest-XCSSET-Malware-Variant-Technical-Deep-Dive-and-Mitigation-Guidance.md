# Latest XCSSET Malware Variant: Technical Deep Dive and Mitigation Guidance

**Author: Microsoft Threat Intelligence**

Microsoft Threat Intelligence has identified a new XCSSET malware variant that targets Xcode projects, thereby impacting developers working on Apple/macOS applications. This technical analysis outlines the new modules, updated infection mechanisms, and recommends practical mitigation strategies for defenders.

## Overview

- **Threat**: Evolving variant of XCSSET malware
- **Target**: Xcode project files (macOS dev environments)
- **Key Updates**: Enhanced browser targeting, persistent mechanisms, encryption/obfuscation, and clipboard/data theft

## Infection Chain

- **Four Main Stages**:
  1. Initial access via infected Xcode projects
  2. Multi-phase execution to deploy malware components
  3. Downloader and loader logic
  4. Expanded functionality in the fourth-stage `boot()` script for module execution

Detailed screenshots and code fragments for each phase highlight technical changes versus previous versions.

## Technical Analysis

### Major Module Changes

**1. Browser and Clipboard Targeting:**

- Detects and exfiltrates Firefox data (incl. passwords and cookies), with new checks in `boot()`
- Clipboard monitoring for digital wallet addresses, auto-replacing content when specific regex patterns are detected

**2. Data Exfiltration and Persistence:**

- Adds run-only compiled AppleScript payloads for stealth
- Uses AES encryption and Base64 encoding for C2 communication
- Sets up *LaunchDaemon* entries for persistence, disables certain Apple software update features
- Deploys fake applications to masquerade its activities
- Git-based persistence logic now encapsulated in shell functions for obfuscation

**3. Info-Stealer Enhancements:**

- Downloads a Mach-O binary (modified HackBrowserData project) to target Firefox profile data
- Uploads ZIP archives with stolen data
- Expanded target lists and regex patterns for various wallet types

### Indicators of Compromise

- Domain IOCs (e.g. `cdntor[.]ru`, `checkcdn[.]ru`)
- SHA-256 hashes for key payloads
- Audit `/tmp` directory and *LaunchDaemon* files for suspicious entries

## Mitigation and Protection Guidance

- Update operating systems and apply security patches promptly
- **Inspect Xcode projects**â€”only use trusted sources and verify files before building
- Cautiously handle clipboard data, especially wallet addresses and sensitive information
- Use browsers with [Microsoft Defender SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-smartscreen) for enhanced phishing/malware protection
- Deploy [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on Mac](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint-mac) for AV and behavioral detection
- Enable cloud-delivered protection, sample submission, PUA protection, and network protection features in Microsoft Defender

## Detection and Hunting

- **Microsoft Defender XDR detections** for various observed malicious behaviors (Trojan, suspicious scripts, LaunchDaemon changes, etc.)
- Included Kusto Query Language (KQL) hunting queries to:
  - Detect suspicious shell commands and persistence actions
  - Identify malicious app creation in temp locations
  - Catch exfiltration logic and domain IOC communication
- Microsoft Sentinel users can map detected domains and indicators using TI analytics, with sample ASIM queries provided
