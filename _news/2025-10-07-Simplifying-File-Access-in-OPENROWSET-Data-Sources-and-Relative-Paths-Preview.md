# Simplifying File Access in OPENROWSET: Data Sources and Relative Paths (Preview)

**Author: Microsoft Fabric Blog**

The latest improvements to the `OPENROWSET` function allow users to utilize external data sources and relative paths, dramatically improving the workflow for querying files within Lakehouse workspaces and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS).

## Accessing Lakehouse Files with Relative Paths

With `OPENROWSET`, instead of using complex absolute (GUID-based) file paths, you can now specify file paths relative to the Lakehouseâ€™s root folder. This makes queries cleaner and more maintainable. For example, in a T-SQL notebook, you can query the *sales.csv* file from a nested folder using:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'data/2025/09/sales.csv',
  FORMAT = 'CSV')
```

This approach avoids hardcoding lengthy paths and reduces errors.

## Making Cross-Lakehouse Access Easier

When accessing files across Lakehouses in OneLake, you previously had to use GUID-based URIs referencing both workspace and Lakehouse IDs in every query. Now, by defining an external data source with a root URI for your Lakehouse, you can reference it by name. Example setup:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE MyLakehouse
WITH (
  LOCATION = 'https://onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/{wsid}/{lhid}'
);
```

Replace `{wsid}` and `{lhid}` with your specific workspace and Lakehouse identifiers. Once set up, you can write queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK 'data/2025/09/sales.csv',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'MyLakehouse',
  FORMAT = 'CSV')
```

## Referencing ADLS Locations

Define external data sources for remote ADLS accounts to further simplify file access:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE MyAdls
WITH (
  LOCATION = 'abfss://{mycontainer}@{mystorage}.dfs.core.windows.net'
);
```

Now you can reference ADLS files with relative paths in your queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
  BULK '/Files/data/2025/09/sales.csv',
  DATA_SOURCE = 'MyAdls',
  FORMAT = 'CSV')
```

## Benefits

- Cleaner, more maintainable SQL code
- Simplified cross-Lakehouse and multi-source data integration
- Eliminates repeated use of absolute URIs
- Streamlines data engineering and analytics workflows
