- Action buttons are closer together for improved usability.

- The panel can be expanded to full height, making it easier to manage pending comments.

## üîó Submodule Support

- When a submodule reference is updated in a pull request, the changes in the submodule can now be individually reviewed directly from the Files Changed page.

## üîß Fixes
