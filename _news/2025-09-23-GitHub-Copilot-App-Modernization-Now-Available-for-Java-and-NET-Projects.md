# GitHub Copilot App Modernization Now Available for Java and .NET Projects

GitHub Copilot's app modernization solution is now generally available for both Java and .NET projects. This capability is designed to accelerate legacy app upgrades and streamline modernization workflows for development teams.

## Key Features

- **Application Assessment Reports**: Analyze existing application codebases to identify modernization opportunities and required changes.
- **Automated Code Transformations**: Apply upgrades (for example, Java version migrations) and refactoring automatically.
- **Build Patching & Dependency Updates**: Keep projects up to date with the latest build tools and dependencies.
- **Containerization for Cloud Deployment**: Easily package applications for deployment in cloud environments using container technologies.

These features help reduce the time required for major upgrades and enable faster migrations from legacy systems to modern architectures.

## Example Workflow

- Assess a Java or .NET application codebase with Copilot, receiving a detailed report.
- Apply automated code changes and dependency updates suggested by Copilot.
- Patch builds and prepare the app for cloud deployment.
- Use Copilot to containerize the service, simplifying deployment to cloud platforms.
