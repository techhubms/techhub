# Meet the GitHub MCP Registry: The Fastest Way to Discover MCP Servers

The new GitHub MCP Registry is designed as a central hub to help developers and AI agents discover and integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers efficiently. Developers faced challenges tracking down MCP servers spread across disparate sources, which led to inefficiencies and security risks. The MCP Registry solves this by offering:

- **A curated directory**: Featuring MCP servers from leading partners and open source contributors, all backed by their respective GitHub repositories.
- **Enhanced discoverability**: Easily browse, search, and install MCP servers directly within tools like VS Code, with servers ranked by GitHub activity.
- **Seamless integrations**: Compatible with GitHub Copilot and any agent or tool that implements the MCP standard, enabling streamlined agentic workflows for coding, automation, and more.

## Key Features

- **Central location for MCP servers**: Unifies previously fragmented MCP discovery across multiple platforms.
- **One-click installation**: Offers direct integration within developer environments.
- **Community-driven quality**: Contributions and curation from launch partners like Figma, Postman, HashiCorp, and Dynatrace ensure trusted, production-ready solutions.
- **Open ecosystem**: Links to broader community initiatives, including a pathway for developers to self-publish to the OSS MCP Community Registry.

## Partner and Community Impact

Quotes from partners highlight new workflows:

- **Figma**: Developers can pull Figma context into Copilot using Dev Mode MCP servers for smoother design-to-code transitions.
- **Postman**: MCP elevates the AI agents stack, deepening API integration and developer productivity.
- **HashiCorp Terraform**: Official servers are now easily discovered and integrated.
- **Dynatrace**: Delivers AI-powered observability and security insights within the IDE.

## Looking Forward

- **Open standards**: Joint work with the open source community, Anthropic, and the MCP Steering Committee aims for a robust, open MCP ecosystem.
- **Unified discovery**: Publication to the OSS MCP Community Registry ensures new servers appear in GitHub's registry, reducing duplication and scaling community contributions.

Developers can now explore, install, and contribute to MCP servers more efficiently, fueling innovation and forming the foundation of future agentic AI toolchains.
