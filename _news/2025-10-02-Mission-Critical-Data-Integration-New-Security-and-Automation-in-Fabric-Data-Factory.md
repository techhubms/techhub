# Mission-Critical Data Integration: Whatâ€™s New in Fabric Data Factory

## Why Mission-Critical Features Matter

Organizations operating at enterprise scale require a data integration platform that is resilient, secure, and designed for high-demand workloads. Fabric Data Factory addresses these requirements by enabling unified data orchestration, stringent protection, and seamless hybrid and cloud integration.

## Key Security, Isolation, and Compliance Enhancements

### Workspace Identity Authentication for Connectors (Generally Available)

- Allows secure and seamless data access using managed service principals assigned to each Fabric workspace (excluding My Workspace).
- Enhances credential management and reduces administrative overhead.
- [More info](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-support-for-workspace-identity-authentication-in-new-fabric-connectors-and-for-dataflow-gen2/)

### Workspace Private Link Support (Preview)

- Enables secure, isolated dataflows, pipelines, and copy jobs via Private Link.
- Supports compliance mandates and network isolation via VNet data gateways.

### Azure Key Vault Integration (Generally Available)

- Centralizes secret and credential management for data source connections.
- Minimizes risk of credential sprawl and supports on-premises gateway connections, with VNet gateway support planned.

### VNet Gateway Support for Pipelines and Copy Jobs

- Ensures all data movements use secure, isolated network routes, rather than exposing data to public networks.
- Strengthens compliance and data boundary management.

### VNet Gateway Lifecycle Controls

- Enables administrators to manage gateway uptime by starting, stopping, and restarting as required.
- Assists with optimizing resource use and supporting maintenance operations.

### PowerShell Automation for Gateway Management (Preview)

- Provides automation for deployment and ownership transfers using PowerShell modules, improving disaster recovery and scaling operations.
- [PowerShell details](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/datagateway/?view=datagateway-ps)

### Upcoming Features

- **Snowflake Key-Pair Authentication**: Enables secure, key-based authentication (coming soon).
- **Outbound Access Protection for Data Factory**: Allows organizations to control and monitor outbound data flows, supporting further compliance and network security (coming soon).

## Impact for Enterprises

These enhancements mean Fabric Data Factory is well-suited for organizations in highly regulated fields, such as finance, government, and healthcare, looking to meet strict security and compliance standards in their data operations.
