# Azure SDK Release Highlights â€“ March 2025

*Author: Hector Norzagaray*

Thank you for your interest in the new Azure SDKs! Each month, Azure releases new features, improvements, and bug fixes across its SDK offerings for developers.

All package links, code, and documentation are available on the [Azure SDK Releases page](https://aka.ms/azsdk/releases).

## Feedback Invitation

If youâ€™re actively using the Azure SDK, the team encourages feedback via their [Developer Survey](https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog-survey).

## Release Highlights

### ðŸš€ Beta Launch: Azure SDK for Rust

- **First official beta releases**: Azure now offers SDKs for the Rust programming language.
- **Supported libraries** (in beta):
  - [Identity](https://crates.io/crates/azure_identity)
  - [Key Vault Secrets](https://crates.io/crates/azure_security_keyvault_secrets)
  - [Key Vault Keys](https://crates.io/crates/azure_security_keyvault_keys)
  - [Event Hubs](https://crates.io/crates/azure_messaging_eventhubs)
  - [Cosmos DB](https://crates.io/crates/azure_data_cosmos)
- **Purpose & Goals**:
  - Provide a seamless, idiomatic Rust experience for Azure service integration.
  - Leverage Rustâ€™s performance and safety features for robust, system-level applications.
  - Expand and refine Azure SDK support for Rust as developer needs evolve.
- **Get Involved**: Feedback, issues, and contributions are welcomed via the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-rust/issues).

### Node.js 18 End of Life

- **Timeline**: Node.js 18 reaches official end of life on April 30, 2025.
