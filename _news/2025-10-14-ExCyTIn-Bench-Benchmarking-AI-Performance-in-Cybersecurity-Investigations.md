# ExCyTIn-Bench: Benchmarking AI for Real-World Cybersecurity Investigations

**Author:** Anand Mudgerikar

ExCyTIn-Bench is Microsoft’s recently released open-source toolkit to evaluate the performance of AI systems in realistic cybersecurity investigations. Unlike previous benchmarks that rely on static quizzes and trivia, ExCyTIn-Bench simulates actual attacks, demanding the kind of complex, multistage analysis you would find in a real Security Operations Center (SOC). Built around Microsoft Sentinel data and designed to operate directly within Azure, it brings industry-level rigor to AI security evaluation.

## Key Features of ExCyTIn-Bench

- **Holistic Scenario Simulation:** Leverages 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel plus related services to create realistic, noisy, and complex cyber incident scenarios.
- **Designed for Real Workflows:** Evaluates not just answers, but the reasoning process, as AI models interact with live data sources and plan investigations step-by-step — reflecting actual SOC analyst workflows in Azure.
- **Grounded in Incident Graphs:** Human analysts use incident graphs (alerts, entities, and relationships) as 'ground truth' for constructing explainable Q&A pairs, allowing for transparent and objective scoring.
- **Transparent, Actionable Metrics:** Provides detailed reward signals for every investigative step, enabling organizations to understand not just 'if' but 'how' a model solves a problem.
- **Open-Source and Collaborative:** Available via [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/SecRL), the framework invites researchers and security vendors to contribute, benchmark, and improve new AI models.

## Integrations and Impact

ExCyTIn-Bench isn’t just an external tool — it is used internally by Microsoft to improve its own AI-driven security products. Models are tested in-depth to identify weaknesses in detection, reasoning, and tool usage. The framework is tightly integrated with Microsoft Security Copilot, Microsoft Sentinel, and Defender, offering a unified way to monitor the cost and performance impact of different language models used in defense workflows.

## Insights from Latest Evaluations

- **Advanced Reasoning is Key:** The latest models (e.g., GPT-5 with high reasoning settings) significantly outperform others, confirming the importance of step-by-step reasoning for sophisticated cyber investigations.
- **Smaller Models Can Compete:** Efficient smaller models with robust chain-of-thought techniques nearly match larger models, providing more accessible options for automation.
- **Open-Source Models Improving:** Open solutions are closing the gap with proprietary systems, making quality AI security tools more obtainable.
- **Metrics Show What Matters:** Fine-grained metrics highlight the value of explicit reasoning over just final answers, guiding security teams to make better choices.

## Get Involved and Next Steps

- ExCyTIn-Bench is free and open for anyone to use, contribute, and share results.
- Personalized tenant-specific benchmarks are in development, promising even more relevant evaluations.
