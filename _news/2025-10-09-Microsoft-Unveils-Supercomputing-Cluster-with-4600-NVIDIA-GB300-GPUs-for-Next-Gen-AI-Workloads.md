# Microsoft Unveils Supercomputing Cluster with 4600+ NVIDIA GB300 GPUs for Next-Gen AI Workloads

**Author:** Satya Nadella (Chairman and CEO at Microsoft)

Microsoft has achieved a significant new milestone in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company unveiled its first supercomputing cluster built around more than 4600 NVIDIA GB300 GPUs, connected via next-generation InfiniBand networking. This marks the start of Microsoft's efforts to scale up to hundreds of thousands of GB300 GPUs across its datacenters, supporting the exponential growth in AI workloads.

Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft, announced:

> "Another first for our AI fleet ... a supercomputing cluster of NVIDIA GB300s with 4600+ GPUs and featuring next gen InfiniBand. First of many as we scale to hundreds of thousands of GB300s across our DCs, and rethink every layer of the stack across silicon, systems, and software to support next gen AI workloads."

This initiative signals Microsoft's commitment to rethinking every layer of the compute stack—including silicon design, systems architecture, and software optimization—to enable next-generation AI services at unprecedented scale and efficiency.
