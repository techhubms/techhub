In this article, Allison discusses the latest development regarding Copilot Chat features on GitHub. <!--excerpt_end--> The announcement reveals that all features of Copilot Chat, previously available only in public preview, are now generally available to every user on github.com. Among the improvements are instant previews, which let developers quickly see the results of suggested code changes; flexible editing options for modifying suggestions; and streamlined management of issues directly from the chat interface.

Enhanced attachment handling now allows for improved collaboration on GitHub, while the new model selection feature provides users greater control over which AI models power their chat experience. These updates aim to improve productivity and collaboration among developers by integrating Copilot's capabilities more deeply into daily workflows. Overall, this general availability milestone marks an important step in expanding the reach of AI-powered development tools to a broader base of GitHub users.
