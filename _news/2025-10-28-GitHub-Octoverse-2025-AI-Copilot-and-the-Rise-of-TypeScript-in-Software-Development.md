# GitHub Octoverse 2025: AI, Copilot, and the Rise of TypeScript in Software Development

**Author**: stclarke  
Based on a podcast summary of the latest GitHub Octoverse report, delivered through Microsoft Copilot.

## Key Takeaways

- **Massive Growth in Developer Community**: Over the past year, 36 million new developers joined GitHub, bringing the total to more than 180 million. This means, on average, a new developer joins GitHub every second.
- **AI Tools Become Mainstream**: The Octoverse report emphasizes how AI—especially GitHub Copilot—has become standard in the development workflow. Notably, GitHub Copilot becoming free in 2024 triggered a surge in new users. Now, 80% of new developers use AI coding tools like Copilot within their first week.
- **Programming Language Shakeups**: TypeScript has overtaken both Python and JavaScript as the most used language on GitHub. The shift toward typed languages is largely driven by their compatibility with AI-assisted development. Nearly all major frontend frameworks now default to TypeScript.
- **Development Activity Stats**:
  - Developers created more than 230 new repositories per minute.
  - Nearly 1 billion commits were made in 2025, with 100 million in August alone.
  - Over 1.1 million public repositories now utilize an LLM software development kit, a 178% year-over-year increase.
  - Pull requests climbed to 518.7 million, up 29% from the previous year.
- **Global Shifts**: India added 5 million developers, accounting for 14% of all new accounts, and is projected to represent one in every three new GitHub developers by 2030.
- **AI as Default**: With 80% of new developers leveraging AI from week one, AI assistants are now an integral part of coding, not an optional add-on.
- **GitHub Agent HQ Announcement**: Agent HQ transforms GitHub into a unified control plane, allowing multiple AI coding agents from different vendors to be used together. This is called 'wave 2' of AI-assisted development—moving beyond code completion into multimodal, AI-native experiences.
- **Language Specialization**: TypeScript dominates for general development while Python remains strong in AI/data science. The JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem remains highly active.
- **Changing Geography of Software Development**: The shift in new developer sign-ups toward India highlights a broader change in where software is being built.

## Podcast as a Learning Medium

- Microsoft Copilot's new podcasting feature was used to automatically generate a 5-minute summary of the full Octoverse report, helping developers quickly digest emerging trends.
- AI-generated podcasts are making technical learning more accessible and efficient for busy professionals.

## Community & Commentary

The post drew responses from developers and industry voices who were excited by the combination of AI, Copilot, and new learning formats like podcasts. There's strong optimism about the power of AI to condense complex information, accelerate learning, and reshape software development for a new generation of global developers.

## Conclusion

AI and developer tooling are rapidly transforming not only the way software is built, but who builds it and where. The GitHub Octoverse 2025 data and the Copilot-powered podcast demonstrate a shift to AI-native practices, with TypeScript's rise and India's growing developer population standing out as defining trends.
