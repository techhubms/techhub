## Key Highlights

### MCP and Agent Mode Enhancements

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Expanded agent mode with support for prompts, resources, and sampling. Authenticate with external MCP servers, debug in development mode, and publish servers via extension APIs.
- **Tool Sets:** Define custom tool sets for agent mode chat, making specialized automation and chat-driven workflows easier to configure and use.
- **Resource Support:** Attach, browse, and manage resources from MCP servers directly within the chat.
- **Authentication Upgrades:** MCP servers now support advanced authentication including GitHub and Entra integration with user account management and device code flow.
- **Development Mode:** Debug Node.js/Python MCP servers with restart-on-change and attachable debugging.

### AI, GitHub Copilot, and Chat Innovations

- **Chat Tooling:** Define and use tool sets; improved UX for chat context, undo, and message role distinction. Add source control history into chat, customize context more easily, and navigate new attachment features.
- **Copilot Coding Agent:** Assign and track work for the Copilot agent, view session progress, and manage PRs via VS Code.
- **Next Edit Suggestions (NES):** Now supports automatic import suggestions in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript with improved suggestion flow.
- **AI-Powered Settings Search:** Experimental semantic search for settings and search suggestions finds results by meaning, not just string matching.

### Python and Notebook Developer Experience

- **Python Chat Tools:** Integrated environment and package tool commands, environment configuration, and enhanced environment managers (pyenv, poetry) for rapid setup and scripting.
- **Notebook Agent Mode:** Agent has improved cell execution tracking, summary tools, and integration for seamless complex workflow management.
- **Project Templates:** Create Python projects with ready-to-go environments and scaffolding directly from the Python Environments extension.

### DevOps, Source Control, and Remote Development

- **Source Control Improvements:** Graph view enhancements, direct context addition from history, multi-file diff, and list/tree views.
- **Pull Requests Extension:** Copilot agent integration, notifications, direct PR/issue work, and in-app image/file viewing for private repos.
- **Remote Development:** SSH pre-connection scripting and streamlined explorer experiences for containerized/cloud development workflows.

### Accessibility and Editor Innovations

- **Sound Cues:** New audio signals for code actions and chat-required user actions.
- **Accessible Dialogs:** Richly labeled confirmation dialogs and alerts for screen reader users in agent mode.
- **Find-As-You-Type:** User-toggled setting for instant or manual search in the editor.
- **EditContext API:** Improved IME support and versatile input experiences now enabled on Stable builds.

### Platform and Extension Authoring

- **Secret Scanning:** VSCE now scans for sensitive information before extension publication, with customizable allowed secrets.
- **Web Environment Detection:** Updated extension host Node.js version with smart global navigator object migration tools for authors.
- **Extension APIs:** New MCP APIs for publishing, discovering, and authenticating MCP server collections.

### Engineering Updates

- **Electron 35 Update:** Brings the latest Chromium and Node.js upgrades for enhanced security, performance, and compatibility.
- **ESM Adoption:** Guidance and examples for adopting ECMAScript modules in extensions targeting NodeJS hosts.

### Notable Fixes & Contributor Acknowledgements

- Fixes include improvements to syntax highlighting, extension host reliability, PowerShell integration, notebook cell operations, and GitHub pull request workflows.
