# Azure DevOps MCP Server, Public Preview

*Author: Dan Hellem*

A few weeks ago at Microsoft BUILD, the upcoming Azure DevOps MCP Server was announced:

ðŸ‘‰ [Azure DevOps with GitHub Repositories â€“ Your path to Agentic AI](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-devops-with-github-repositories-your-path-to-agentic-ai/)

Today, the local Azure DevOps MCP Server is now available in **public preview**.

## What Does This Mean?

The Azure DevOps MCP Server enables GitHub Copilot (in both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code) to access and interact with your Azure DevOps environment, including:

- Work items
- Pull requests
- Test plans
- Builds
- Releases
- Wiki pages

## What is an MCP Server?

A local **MCP Server** (Model Context Provider) acts as a bridge between your AI assistant (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and your Azure DevOps organization. Its primary role is to inject rich, real-time project contextâ€”like work items, PRs, test plansâ€”into LLM prompts. This allows the AI to provide better, more targeted, and context-sensitive support tailored to your Azure DevOps project.

Unlike cloud-only solutions, the MCP Server runs within your local network or development environment. It was designed to securely access your private project data without that data leaving your control.

## Example Usage

The [how-to guide](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/blob/main/docs/HOWTO.md#%EF%B8%8F-examples) offers multiple examples and prompts. One example:

- Take a user story
- Generate detailed test cases from the work item description
- Link those test cases directly back to the original story

If you want examples for other scenarios, suggestions and requests are welcome via [the repositoryâ€™s issues page](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/issues).

## Getting Started

Initial setup is straightforward, though a few steps are required. It is advised to follow the [full setup instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/blob/main/README.md) for best results.

Quick overview:

1. Visit the [Azure DevOps MCP Server repository](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp)
2. Sign in using the Azure CLI: `az login`
3. Copy and paste the provided configuration into your local `.vscode\mcp.json` file
4. Start the MCP Server and begin integrating with your Azure DevOps tools

## Feedback

The Azure DevOps team is actively collecting feedback during this public preview stage. Any issues, ideas, or suggestions can be submitted or discussed via [Issues in the repo](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/issues).
