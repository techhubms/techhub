Allison introduces the GitHub Copilot coding agent for Linear, now in public preview, outlining how developers can automate issue resolution and code contributions using AI-powered autonomous agents.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub Copilot for Linear Available in Public Preview

GitHub has announced the public preview of the Copilot coding agent integration with Linear. This integration allows developers to assign Linear issues to the Copilot coding agent, which can autonomously analyze, implement, and review changes to your codebase.

## How It Works

- **Assign Issues:** Once you assign a Linear issue to the Copilot coding agent, the agent analyzes the issueâ€™s contents and opens a draft pull request (PR).
- **Ephemeral Development Environment:** Copilot works independently using an ephemeral environment powered by GitHub Actions, giving it the ability to:
  - Explore your codebase
  - Make code changes
  - Run automated tests and linters
- **Progress Updates:** You receive real-time progress reports streamed directly to your Linear activity timeline.
- **Pull Request Review:** After the agent completes its work, it requests a pull request review so you remain in control of all code changes.

## Key Features & Benefits

- Automate routine coding tasks, such as bug fixes, refactoring, and documentation updates.
- Minimize manual context switching between Linear and GitHub.
- Maintain your current review and approval processes for all pull requests generated by Copilot.

## Getting Started

To enable this integration:

1. Install the [GitHub Copilot coding agent for Linear app](https://github.com/apps/github-copilot-for-linear?utm_source=changelog-marketplace-cta-ccaintegration-linear&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25) from the GitHub Marketplace (requires GitHub org owner and Linear workspace admin permissions).
2. Read the official documentation for more details:
   - [Integration Guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/integrate-coding-agent-with-linear)
   - [About Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent)
