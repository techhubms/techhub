- **Environment Secret Management:** Introduced `azd env set-secret` command and support for using Azure Key Vault secrets in an `azd` environment. [Learn more](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/main/cli/azd/docs/using-environment-secrets.md).
- **Authentication Enhancements:** Displays identity info post-`azd auth login`; introduces the `azd auth login --check-status` command. Thanks to [John Aziz](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/2856).
