# GitHub Pull Request “Files Changed” Public Preview Experience – September 11 Updates

**Author:** Allison

## Overview

GitHub has released notable improvements to the pull request "Files changed" experience, now available in public preview. This release addresses major pain points for teams reviewing large pull requests by introducing:

- **Single file view:** Automatically enabled for pull requests with a significant number of file changes, showing only one file’s diff at a time for better browser performance.
- **Navigation controls:** New toolbar buttons allow reviewers to easily move to the next or previous file without overloading the browser.
- **Raised file limits:** The maximum number of files supported has increased from 300 to 1,000, making it much easier to review even the largest code changesets.

## Key Features & Benefits

- **Performance Improvements:** By only rendering diffs for a single file at a time, browser responsiveness and review speed are greatly enhanced, especially on large pull requests.
- **Enhanced Navigation:** With new UI controls, jumping between files is straightforward and doesn’t require loading every file all at once.
- **Larger PR Support:** Teams can effectively work with pull requests involving hundreds or thousands of files with the expanded limit.

## How to Try

- A 'Try the new experience' link is now present at the top of the existing PR 'Files changed' page.
- Feedback, questions, and known issues are handled via the dedicated [feedback discussion board](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback).

> The update is rolling out gradually to gather feedback and make iterative improvements. The UI and features may change as feedback is received.

## Additional Notes

- These enhancements come as part of GitHub's ongoing efforts to streamline code review workflows and performance for developer teams.
- Public preview features are subject to change prior to general availability.
