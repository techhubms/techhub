Ashley Wolf demonstrates how maintainers can use GitHub Models and AI-powered workflows to automate essential but repetitive open source project tasks, streamlining project management and contributor interactions.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Automating Open Source Maintenance with GitHub Models and AI Workflows

Maintaining open source projects requires balancing passion for building with the reality of persistent project management tasks. As projects grow, maintainers spend much of their time on issue triage, duplicate detection, spam filtering, and onboarding new contributors—often at the expense of strategic development.

This guide by Ashley Wolf walks through how **GitHub Models** and **GitHub Actions** can transform these repetitive tasks using AI-driven automation, allowing maintainers to focus on what truly matters.

## Common Pain Points for Maintainers

Surveys of over 500 maintainers highlighted:

- **60%** want help with issue triage (labeling, categorizing, managing flow)
- **30%** need duplicate detection
- **10%** are concerned about spam
- **5%** cited the need for detecting low-quality contributions

Most maintainers seek AI as a collaborative assistant—helpful but not intrusive.

## What Is Continuous AI?

*Continuous AI* is a pattern where automated AI workflows, powered by GitHub Models and GitHub Actions, continuously support project maintenance, similar to how CI/CD transformed testing and deployment. These workflows can run without additional setup if GitHub Models is enabled for your repository.

## Practical Automation Examples

Below are practical, ready-to-use YAML workflow examples for immediate integration into your projects. Enable GitHub Models in your repository, then copy these workflows into your `.github/workflows` directory.

### 1. Automatic Issue Deduplication

Detect and link possible duplicate issues automatically when new ones are opened:

```yaml
name: Detect duplicate issues
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]
permissions:
  models: read
  issues: write
jobs:
  continuous-triage-dedup:
    if: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.user.type != 'Bot' }}{% endraw %}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: pelikhan/action-genai-issue-dedup@v0
        with:
          github_token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
      # Optional tuning: labels, count, since
```

Customize `labels`, `count`, and `since` to focus comparisons as needed.

### 2. Issue Completeness Checks

Automate identification of incomplete issues and request missing information:

```yaml
name: Issue Completeness Check
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  issues: write
  models: read
jobs:
  check-completeness:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check issue completeness
        uses: actions/ai-inference@v1
        id: ai
        with:
          prompt: |
            Analyze this GitHub issue for completeness. If missing reproduction steps, version, or expected/actual behavior, respond with a friendly request. If complete, say so.
            Title: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.title }}{% endraw %}
            Body: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.body }}{% endraw %}
            system-prompt: You are a helpful assistant that helps analyze GitHub issues for completeness.
            model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
            temperature: 0.2
      - name: Comment on issue
        if: steps.ai.outputs.response != ''
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              issue_number: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.number }}{% endraw %},
              body: `{% raw %}${{ steps.ai.outputs.response }}{% endraw %}`
            })
```

### 3. Spam and “Slop” Detection

Detect spam, AI-generated or low-quality issues/pull requests using AI:

```yaml
name: Contribution Quality Check
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
  models: read
jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Detect spam or low-quality content
        uses: actions/ai-inference@v1
        id: ai
        with:
          prompt: |
            Is this GitHub {% raw %}${{ github.event_name == 'issues' && 'issue' || 'pull request' }}{% endraw %} spam, AI-generated slop, or low quality?
            Title: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.title || github.event.pull_request.title }}{% endraw %}
            Body: {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.body || github.event.pull_request.body }}{% endraw %}
            Respond: spam, ai-generated, needs-review, or ok
            system-prompt: You detect spam and low-quality contributions. Be conservative.
            model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
            temperature: 0.1
      - name: Apply label if needed
        if: steps.ai.outputs.response != 'ok'
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const label = `{% raw %}${{ steps.ai.outputs.response }}{% endraw %}`;
            const number = {% raw %}${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number }}{% endraw %};
            if (label && label !== 'ok') {
              await github.rest.issues.addLabels({ owner: context.repo.owner, repo: context.repo.repo, issue_number: number, labels: [label] });
            }
```

### 4. Continuous Resolver

On a schedule, close or comment on outdated or resolved issues and pull requests:

```yaml
name: Continuous AI Resolver
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'
  workflow_dispatch:
permissions:
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
jobs:
  resolver:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run resolver
        uses: ashleywolf/continuous-ai-resolver@main
        with:
          github_token: {% raw %}${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}{% endraw %}
```

### 5. New Contributor Onboarding

Automatically send a welcome message to first-time contributors:

```yaml
name: Welcome New Contributors
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  models: read
jobs:
  welcome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.pull_request.author_association == 'FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR'
    steps:
      - name: Generate welcome message
        uses: actions/ai-inference@v1
        id: ai
        with:
          prompt: |
            Write a friendly welcome for a first-time contributor:
            1. Thank for their first PR
            2. Mention checking CONTRIBUTING.md
            3. Offer to help
            model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
            temperature: 0.7
      - name: Post welcome comment
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const message = `{% raw %}${{ steps.ai.outputs.response }}{% endraw %}`;
            await github.rest.issues.createComment({ owner: context.repo.owner, repo: context.repo.repo, issue_number: {% raw %}${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}{% endraw %}, body: message });
```

## Best Practices

- Start small: implement one workflow and expand as you go
- Keep maintainers in control until you trust the automation
- Tailor AI prompts to fit your project's tone
- Continuously monitor and improve the automation
- Avoid generic, unreviewed, or spammy actions

## Getting Started

1. Enable GitHub Models in your repository settings
2. Use the AI playground to prototype prompts
3. Save working prompts as `.prompt.yml` files
4. Integrate example workflows above
5. Share your approaches with the broader maintainer community
