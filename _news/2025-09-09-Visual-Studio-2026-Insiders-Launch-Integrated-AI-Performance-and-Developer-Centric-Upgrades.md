Mads Kristensen introduces Visual Studio 2026 Insiders, highlighting major advances in AI-powered development, improved performance, and a reimagined user experience for professional developers.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Visual Studio 2026 Insiders is here!

Visual Studio 2026 Insiders marks a bold new chapter in Microsoft's leading IDE, focusing on deeper integration of AI, enhanced performance, and a refreshed look that prioritizes developer productivity.

## Key Highlights

### AI Integrated Development

- **AI woven into daily workflow:** The new AI features are not standalone add-onsâ€”they are deeply embedded, providing contextual help as you explore new codebases, suggest common tests, and ensure that documentation and comments keep pace with your code.
- **Assisted code review:** The IDE brings actionable insights on correctness, performance, and security before you open a pull request, helping you refine code with greater confidence.
- **Autonomous adaptation:** Tasks like paste-and-fix are streamlined as the editor adapts snippets to your repository's conventions.
- **Copilot Free integration:** Visual Studio 2026 now offers GitHub Copilot Free, making AI-powered code suggestions available within the IDE for everyone.

### Performance Improvements

- **Enterprise-scale speed:** Opening solutions, navigating code, building, and launching (F5) are significantly faster, even on large projects and both x64 and Arm64 architectures.
- **Profiler Agent:** The built-in Profiler Agent helps identify and fix performance issues efficiently, enabling smoother workflows and improved application performance.

### Modern Look and Feel

- **Redesigned UI:** The new version features Fluent UI, crisper iconography, refined spacing, and 11 new color themes for improved clarity and focus.
- **Personalization:** Enhanced options and more accessible visual elements make it easier to customize the IDE for any workflow or preference.

### The Insiders Channel

- The Insiders Channel replaces the previous Preview Channel, letting developers get first access to new features and monthly updates.
- Visual Studio 2026 Insiders installs alongside previous versions and supports easy settings import for rapid onboarding.
