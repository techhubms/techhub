- **Security**: Built-in security features and compliance help protect sensitive organizational data.
- **AI-Ready Foundation**: Modern infrastructure supports integration with Azure AI services and future-proofs data architecture.
- **Hybrid and Multicloud Support**: Integrates with existing on-premises infrastructure and supports hybrid scenarios.

## Real-World Examples
