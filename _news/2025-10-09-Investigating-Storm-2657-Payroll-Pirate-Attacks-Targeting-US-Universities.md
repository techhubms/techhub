# Investigating Storm-2657 'Payroll Pirate' Attacks Targeting US Universities

Microsoft Threat Intelligence has tracked a financially motivated threat actor known as Storm-2657, responsible for compromising employee accounts across US universities to redirect salary payments to attacker-controlled accounts—a scheme dubbed “payroll pirate.”

## Attack Summary

- **Targets**: Higher education sector, specifically employees using HR SaaS platforms such as Workday.
- **Techniques**: Social engineering and advanced phishing emails (including adversary-in-the-middle links) to bypass MFA and hijack employee profiles.
- **Access Flow**:
    - Phishing emails crafted to steal credentials and MFA codes, including those leveraging Google Docs for evasion.
    - Compromised accounts used to spread further attacks within and across academic organizations.
    - Attackers modify Workday profiles, update payroll/bank account info, and create Exchange Online inbox rules to hide notification emails.
    - Persistence achieved by enrolling attacker-controlled MFA devices.

## Observed Campaign Tactics

- University employees received realistic phishing emails with urgent themes:
    - Illness exposure notifications (COVID-like case, communicable illness)
    - Faculty misconduct and compliance notices
    - HR compensation and benefits updates, often impersonating official entities
- Attackers exploited both lack of MFA and weak MFA implementations.
- Inbox rules with generic or obfuscated names used to hide critical Workday notification emails.

## Technical Detection and Mitigation

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps & Exchange Online**: Correlate signals between Workday and Exchange to detect:
    - New inbox rules linked to payroll modification
    - Email deletion events (SoftDelete, HardDelete, MoveToDeletedItems)
    - Workday logs: “Change My Account”, “Manage Payment Elections”
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Use Workday connector and TI Mapping analytics to match indicators and track inbox rule manipulation and risky sign-ins involving new or unknown MFA devices.
- **Microsoft Defender XDR**: Integrated defense and hunting queries for:
    - Compromised user accounts
    - Inbox rule creation/removal
    - Payroll changes
    - Device additions (Add iOS/Android Device)
    - Bulk phishing attempts from .edu domains

### Example KQL Queries

```kql
CloudAppEvents | where Timestamp >= ago(1d) | where Application == "Microsoft Exchange Online" and ActionType in ("New-InboxRule", "Set-InboxRule") | where Parameters has "From" and Parameters has "@myworkday.com" | where Parameters has "DeleteMessage" or Parameters has ("MoveToFolder")
```

```kql
CloudAppEvents | where Timestamp >= ago(1d) | where Application == "Workday" | where ActionType == "Change My Account" or ActionType == "Manage Payment Elections"
```

## Mitigation Guidance

1. **Enforce phishing-resistant MFA** for privileged and sensitive roles using options like FIDO2 keys, Windows Hello for Business, and Microsoft Authenticator passkeys.
2. **Reset credentials** and revoke compromise tokens immediately upon detection.
3. **Review and remove unauthorized MFA device registrations and inbox rules.**
4. **Revert changes to payroll/bank info** and notify affected teams.
5. **Monitor for suspicious activity** with Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, and Security Copilot.
