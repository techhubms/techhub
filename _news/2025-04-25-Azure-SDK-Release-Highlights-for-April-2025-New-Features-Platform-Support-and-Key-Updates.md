# Azure SDK Release (April 2025)

**Author:** Hector Norzagaray

## Release Highlights

### Node.js 18 End of Life

According to the official [Node.js release timeline](https://nodejs.org/about/previous-releases), Node.js 18 is scheduled to reach its end-of-life on **April 30, 2025**. After this date, it will no longer receive security updates and critical bug fixes.

**Recommendations:**

- Upgrade to a supported Node.js version to continue receiving support and updates.
- The Azure SDK libraries are not guaranteed to function on platforms or with dependencies that have reached end-of-life. Dropping support for deprecated dependencies may occur without increasing the Azure SDK's major version.
- Migrate to supported platforms and dependencies for ongoing technical support.

For extended guidance, read the [Azure SDK Blog post on Node.js 18 end of support](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/announcing-the-end-of-support-for-node-js-18-x-in-the-azure-sdk-for-javascript/).
