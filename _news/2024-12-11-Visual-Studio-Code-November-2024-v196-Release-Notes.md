# Visual Studio Code November 2024 (v1.96) Release Highlights

The November 2024 update to Visual Studio Code brings a broad set of enhancements to improve the developer experience, especially for those using AI-assisted tooling with GitHub Copilot. Below you'll find an overview of key features, Copilot updates, and development productivity highlights from this release.

## GitHub Copilot and AI Features

### GitHub Copilot Free Plan

- A new free tier is available for GitHub Copilot, allowing users with a GitHub account to leverage code completions and chat monthly quotas.
- Sign-up is accessible directly from within VS Code, streamlining onboarding for developers.
- Read more: [Copilot Free plan details](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot).

### Copilot Edits Improvements

- Rapidly edit multiple files at once with natural language commands using Copilot Edits (preview feature).
- Enhanced progress visibility, streamlined change review controls, and the ability to move chat sessions into Copilot Edits for batch suggestions.
- Improved file suggestions and working set management, including context addition from explorer and search views.
- Session restore support: edit sessions are now maintained after VS Code restarts.

### Copilot Debugging Support

- The `copilot-debug` terminal command enables Copilot-assisted debugging for any project or language. Example usage: `copilot-debug python foo.py`.
- After execution, easily save or regenerate launch configurations and rerun sessions.
- Includes dynamic pre-launch task generation for compiled languages (Rust, C++, etc.).

### Copilot Chat and Context Features

- Symbols and folders can now be added as chat or edit context with simple drag-and-drop from across the editor.
- Global symbol picker and improved context management for larger projects.

### Copilot Usage Metrics

- New graph in Runtime Status view shows Copilot extension chat usage over time, aiding in extension insight and troubleshooting.

### Custom Instructions for Commit Messages

- Specify format or content guidelines for Copilot-generated commit messages using workspace or user settings.

### Inline and Terminal Chat Enhancements

- Improved hinting, accessibility, and UI in inline chatâ€”including pseudo-code recognition and context suggestions.
- Terminal inline chat now matches the editor chat appearance and usability.

## Editor and Coding Productivity

- New overtype mode in the editor (toggle with Insert key): easier editing of markdown tables and fixed-width content.
- JavaScript/TypeScript "Paste with Imports": automatically adds missing imports when pasting code.
- Persisted editor find history across sessions and workspaces for better search continuity.

## DevOps, Testing, and Extension Authoring

- Attributable test coverage: filter code coverage by individual test, with extension API support.
- Source Control improvements, including experimental Git blame decorations and updated push/pull workflow.
- Configurable extension allow-list for enterprises and support for VS Code installations with preselected extensions.

## Language Support and Tooling

### TypeScript 5.7

- Updated built-in support brings new language features, expanded hover info, and bug fixes.

### Python Updates

- Python Environments extension (preview): graphical UI for managing Python environments and packages.
- Testing rewrite and REPL improvements; dynamic pytest rootdir settings and better test debug session handling.
- Pylance "full" IntelliSense mode for more complete code analysis (with associated performance tradeoffs).

## Remote Development and Accessibility

- Improved experience for remote containers, SSH, and WSL.
- More robust accessibility signals for code actions and REPL execution focus controls.

## Additional Improvements

- Enhanced extension disk usage information, direct download support in the marketplace.
- Terminal ligature support, new link formats, and keyboard shortcuts for notebook editing.
- Start of GPU acceleration groundwork in the VS Code editor, aiming at lower latency and improved performance.
- Deprecation notice for macOS Catalina support alongside the upcoming Electron 33 update.

## Community Contributions

The VS Code team recognizes extensive community contributions to this release, in areas including extension development, bug fixes, Python/Jupyter enhancements, and developer ergonomics.
