# AI Genius Challenge: Flex Your AI Skills and Beat the Clock

*By Priyanka Vergadia*

If you’ve been following along with the AI Genius Series, you already know we’ve been on a journey filled with learning, experimentation, and discovery. We've explored the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), delved into Copilot deployment, and uncovered the potential within Azure’s AI ecosystem. Now, it's time to take that knowledge into action.

## What is the AI Genius Challenge?

The AI Genius Challenge is a fast-paced, hands-on virtual hackathon designed to test your skills, stretch your thinking, and ignite your creativity using concepts from the series. In this event, you'll be placed in a dramatic scenario: a global zero-day cyberattack has compromised critical infrastructure, and you're tasked with restoring order—as quickly as possible.

Participants will:

- Build real-world solutions using Azure tools such as AI Studio, Kubernetes, and Databases.
- Deploy a public RAG endpoint that is monitored and scored in real-time by AI agents.
- Complete the challenge against the clock, with only two hours to deliver a solution.

This isn’t just another test; it's a practical proving ground for your newly acquired AI and Azure skills.

## Why Join?

Developers learn best by building, breaking, and solving problems that matter. The AI Genius Challenge provides:

- **A gamified lab environment**: Apply your knowledge in a real-world scenario.
- **Skill testing and competition**: Go head-to-head with peers across Asia during a live, timed challenge. Receive AI-powered feedback and live scoring.
- **Idea expansion**: Build validated, working tools and refine your approach with real-time performance insights.
- **Recognition**: Earn a LinkedIn AI Genius Challenger badge to showcase your accomplishment and skills.

*Note: If you missed previous live sessions, all material is available on-demand via the [AI Genius Series YouTube Playlist](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fplaylist%3Flist%3DPLmsFUfdnGr3ya5T6JBAilVXd3Jg7rZa6w).

## How It Works

- **Date:** June 17
- **Materials:** Access to interactive workbooks that guide your challenge experience
- **Evaluation:** Judged on accuracy, efficiency, and execution. Your endpoint will be tested every 20 seconds against a secret source-of-truth.
- **Registration:** Sign up via the [Microsoft AI Genius Challenge event page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/25268/); credentials will be provided by the partner platform.
- **Duration:** The core challenge lasts 90 minutes with a 30-minute grace period. A leaderboard fosters friendly competition among participants.

## What’s Next?

The challenge supports Microsoft’s broader commitment to hands-on AI skilling opportunities. While this event is the culmination of the AI Genius Series, it launches an ongoing community for Azure AI builders and innovators.
