# Foundry Local Meets More Silicon: Expanded AI Runtime and NPU Support

Foundry Local is a high-performance AI runtime stack from Azure AI Foundry that enables developers to build and run cross-platform AI applications efficiently on client devices. This update introduces new capabilities for Foundry Local, reinforcing Microsoft's commitment to democratizing AI at the edge.

## The Evolution of AI Acceleration

- Early on-device AI workloads relied on CPUs, but often suffered from real-time inference limitations due to performance and power constraints.
- The advent of GPUs brought parallelism and improved inference speeds, marking the first leap forward for edge AI.
- NPUs (Neural Processing Units) are now the latest breakthrough, purpose-built for neural network workloads. They deliver higher efficiency and throughput, making advanced AI models feasible on both desktop and mobile hardware.
- This hardware evolution allows AI solutions to be faster, more energy-efficient, and privacy-preserving—often working independently of the cloud.

## What’s New in Foundry Local v0.7

- **Expanded NPU Support**: Now includes Intel and AMD NPUs on Windows 11, joining existing NVIDIA and Qualcomm silicon support.
- **Improved Hardware Detection**: Foundry Local leverages Windows ML to automatically detect available hardware (NPU, GPU, CPU) and retrieve the correct execution providers, streamlining setup.
- **No Bundled Providers Needed**: The stack now automatically acquires execution providers, reducing package size and easing installation.
- **Cross-Platform Availability**: Optimized experiences are available for both Windows and MacOS users.
