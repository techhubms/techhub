# National 4-H Council and Microsoft Extend $10M Partnership to Expand AI Education for Rural Youth and Educators

For eight years, the National 4-H Council and Microsoft have collaborated to help bridge the digital divide in rural communities. Their joint initiatives, such as the 4-H Tech Changemakers program, have delivered digital skills training, reaching 1.4 million youth through the AI Foundations curriculum offered in Minecraft Education in 2024. This renewed investment builds on ‘Beyond Ready’, 4-H’s goal to reach 10 million youth by 2030, further integrating AI learning into rural education.

## Key Research Insights

- Research by 4-H and Microsoft found widespread interest in AI among youth (ages 9–17), with 66% aware of generative AI fundamentals, but only 28% of rural youth feeling well-informed compared to their urban and suburban peers.
- 72% of surveyed youth expressed the need for guided adult support for responsible use of AI.
- 64% believe AI will aid future career development.

## Major Initiatives in 2025–2026

- **Training Teachers**: Educators will receive training on AI basics, ethics, responsibility, and practical applications, especially via land grant universities.
- **Train-the-Trainer Modules**: Local 4-H programs will leverage new modules to integrate AI teaching within their communities.
- **Hands-on Challenges**: AI-focused events, like the 4-H AI Challenge and AI in Ag Challenge, enable youth to apply AI solutions to local agricultural and community problems.
- **National Collaboration**: The partnership encourages youth participation in broader efforts such as the Presidential AI Challenge, building connections and mentorship networks.

## Impact Example: AI in Agriculture

Henry Zou, a member of Iowa State University's 4-H Extension, developed DeGLS (Detection of Gray Leaf Spot), a deep learning-based system that assists farmers by identifying and measuring the severity of Gray Leaf Spot in corn, an agricultural disease. This AI-driven project exemplifies the potential benefits of integrating technology and agriculture for real-world community impact.

## About the Partners

- **4-H**: The largest US youth development organization, 4-H supports over six million young people annually with programs in critical life skills, STEM, and leadership, aiming to grow to ten million by 2030.
- **Microsoft**: A leading provider of AI-powered platforms and tools, Microsoft’s mission is to responsibly empower people and organizations—including through educational partnerships like this—to succeed in an AI-driven future.
