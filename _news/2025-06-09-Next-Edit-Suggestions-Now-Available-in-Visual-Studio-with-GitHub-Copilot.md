# Next Edit Suggestions Now Available in Visual Studio with GitHub Copilot

*By Simona Liao*

GitHub Copilot is well-known for its code completions (those familiar 'gray text' suggestions) that help autocomplete unfinished code and offer helpful templates. However, code writing is only part of development—editing and refactoring are equally crucial. What if Copilot could support these activities too?

We are excited to announce **Next Edit Suggestions (NES)**, now available in **Visual Studio 2022 17.14**. NES leverages your previous code edits to predict your next likely changes—be those insertions, deletions, or a mix. Unlike traditional Copilot completions, which are limited to your caret position, NES proactively surfaces suggestions anywhere in your file, pointing you to the most probable next edit.

## Example Usage Scenarios

Next Edit Suggestions are helpful in several scenarios. They go beyond repetitive tasks such as renaming by making logical code changes—like updating when you add new variables or alter a method’s purpose. Here are some examples:

### 1. Refactoring a 2D Point Class to 3D Point

- NES recognizes a pattern and suggests changes across the class as you refactor from 2D to 3D.

### 2. Updating Code Syntax to Modern C++ (Using STL)

- NES can update not just `printf()` to `std::cout` but also handles other syntax, such as refactoring `fgets()`.

### 3. Making Logical Changes After Adding New Variables

- NES quickly adapts when a new variable is added, updating logic consistently throughout the code.

## Getting Started with Next Edit Suggestions

To enable NES:

1. Go to **Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Completions > Enable Next Edit Suggestions** in Visual Studio 2022 17.14.
2. Once enabled, NES works as you code. When a suggestion is ready, it appears in a diff view:
    - **Red** highlights original code.
    - **Green** shows Copilot’s suggested changes.

If NES finds an edit on a different line, a navigation hint appears:

- The hint bar indicates you should press **Tab** to jump to the line containing the suggestion.
- An arrow in the gutter shows edit location.
- After landing on the edit line, **Tab** accepts the suggestion.

Once on the intended line:

- The gutter arrow changes color.
- The hint bar recommends **Tab to Accept**.

## Mouse Interaction

- An arrow in the gutter signals edit suggestions.
- Clicking it brings up a menu: **Navigate to**, **Accept**, or **Dismiss** the suggestion.
