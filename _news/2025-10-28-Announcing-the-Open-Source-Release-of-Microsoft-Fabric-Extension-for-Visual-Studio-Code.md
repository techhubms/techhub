# Announcing the Open-Source Release of Microsoft Fabric Extension for Visual Studio Code

The Microsoft Fabric Core extension for Visual Studio Code is now officially [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-fabric). This development demonstrates Microsoft’s commitment to transparency, community involvement, and building robust tools for innovators using Microsoft Fabric.

## Overview of the Fabric Core Extension

The [Microsoft Fabric extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fabric.vscode-fabric) is a foundational component for developers who work with Microsoft Fabric. It centralizes common operations needed across all Fabric workloads and is built with extensibility and automation in mind.

### Key Features Include

- **Authentication & Tenant Management:** Seamlessly sign in/out and switch tenants within Fabric environments.
- **Workspace Management:** Open, create, and navigate between Fabric workspaces directly from VS Code.
- **Item Operations:** Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for working with Fabric items.
- **Git Integration:** Clone Git-enabled workspaces and manage version control tasks within your Fabric projects.
- **Extension API:** Developers can build satellite extensions on top of the core using exposed APIs and services.

## Satellite Extensions for Specialized Workloads

Satellite extensions are add-ins that expand the core capabilities of the Fabric extension for specific scenarios. For example:

- **User Data Functions Extension:** Provides tools for authoring, debugging, and deploying user-defined functions in Fabric. [Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/create-user-data-functions-vs-code)

This architecture allows developers and teams to solve specialized problems while leveraging the foundation provided by the core extension.
