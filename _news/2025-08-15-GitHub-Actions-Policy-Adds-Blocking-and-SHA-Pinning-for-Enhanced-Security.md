Allison outlines recent improvements to GitHub Actions policies, focusing on blocking vulnerable actions and enforcing SHA pinning to enhance repository and workflow security.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub Actions Policy Adds Blocking and SHA Pinning for Enhanced Security

*Author: Allison*

## Overview

GitHub Actions now offers administrators and developers improved control over workflows through new policy features: the ability to **explicitly block actions or versions**, and to **enforce dependency pinning via commit SHA**. These tools address potential vulnerabilities and supply chain risks inherent in using third-party and community-contributed actions.

## Key Features

### 1. Explicit Blocking of Actions or Versions

- **New Policy Support**: Administrators can now block specific actions or particular versions by prefixing them with `!` in the allowed actions list.
- **Blocklist Precedence**: Blocklist rules take precedence, overriding other policy configurations.
- **Use Case**: Protect repositories from actions discovered to be malicious, even if previously allowed by other policies.

### 2. Mandatory SHA Pinning

- **What is SHA Pinning?**: Workflow dependencies can be restricted to exact commit SHAs, preventing the automatic use of new or potentially malicious updates to tags or branches.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Administrators have the option to require SHA pinning, visible as a new checkbox in the GitHub Actions settings (unless all actions are disabled at the repo/org/enterprise level).
- **Compliance**: Any workflow not following SHA pinning will fail to run if this enforcement is enabled.

## Documentation and Best Practices

- Updated GitHub documentation covers [allowed actions policies](https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#managing-github-actions-permissions-for-your-repository) and [SHA pinning enforcement](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/security/secure-use#using-third-party-actions).
- The [GitHub Well-Architected Framework](https://wellarchitected.github.com/library/application-security/recommendations/actions-security) is updated to recommend blocking and SHA pinning for robust supply chain security.

## Roadmap and Ecosystem Hardening

- New **Immutable Releases** are being introduced. Once a release is marked immutable, it and its associated assets/tags cannot be altered or deleted.
- Release attestation supports artifact integrity and integrates with protection rulesets via both UI and API.
- Benefits to the GitHub Actions ecosystem include:
  - Reliable pinning of dependencies to immutable references
  - Trusted verifiable workflow assets
  - Greater pipeline stability and reproducibility
- Dependabot continues to play a role in identifying and upgrading actions with known vulnerabilities.

## Actionable Takeaways

- Review and update your organization/repository allowed actions and reusable workflows policies.
- Enable and enforce SHA pinning for third-party actions to reduce the risk of supply chain compromise.
- Reference updated documentation as policies evolve and leverage immutable releases for stronger artifact security.
