# Managing GitHub Copilot Business Licenses with Enterprise Teams (Public Preview)

GitHub Enterprise Cloud has introduced **Enterprise Teams** in public preview, enhancing the way enterprises manage users and Copilot Business licenses. This update is especially relevant for organizations with large numbers of users and complex access requirements.

## Key Features

- **Direct User Addition**: Enterprise owners can add users to the enterprise without requiring them to first join an organization. These "unaffiliated" users do not consume a license by default, which streamlines onboarding and offboarding.

- **Enterprise Teams & Groups**: Admins can create and manage enterprise-level teams or groups, improving the organization of users within the enterprise account.

- **SCIM Synchronization**: Enterprises with Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) can sync user groups from their identity provider directly to GitHub Enterprise Teams via the SCIM protocol.

- **Flexible Copilot Business License Management**: Licenses for Copilot Business can now be managed and assigned at the enterprise team or individual user level using a dedicated Copilot licensing page. Assignment no longer requires the user to have a GitHub Enterprise Cloud license, allowing broader distribution of Copilot Business.

## Upcoming Enhancements

Future updates will allow:

- Assignment of enterprise roles to teams
- Assigning teams to multiple organizations within an enterprise to grant access automatically
- Delegation capabilities for organization and repository owners to adjust team roles

## User Offboarding Considerations

- Users removed from all organizations will remain as unaffiliated users unless explicitly removed from the enterprise.
- Enterprises should update their offboarding processes to account for these new flows and ensure compliance.
