Join our [weekly office hours](http://aka.ms/aipython/oh) on Foundry Discord:\n\n- **Tuesdays @ 11AM PT**  → Python + AI\n- **Thursdays @ 8:30 AM** **PT** → All things MCP\n\n### Building MCP servers with FastMCP\n\n[!\\[YouTube video\\](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_mUuhOwv9PY/hqdefault.jpg) 📺 Watch YouTube recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mUuhOwv9PY)\n\nIn the intro session of our Python + MCP series, we dive into the hottest technology of 2025: MCP (Model Context Protocol). This open protocol makes it easy to extend AI agents and chatbots with custom functionality, making them more powerful and flexible. We demonstrate how to use the Python FastMCP SDK to build an MCP server running locally. Then we consume that server from chatbots like GitHub Copilot in VS Code, using it's tools, resources, and prompts. Finally, we discover how easy it is to connect AI agent frameworks like Langchain and Microsoft agent-framework to the MCP server.\n\n- [Slides for this session](https://aka.ms/pythonmcp/slides/servers)\n- [Code repository with examples: python-mcp-demos](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-openai-demos)\n\n### Deploying MCP servers to the cloud\n\n[!\\[YouTube video\\](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gL3WYfXAiWI/hqdefault.jpg) 📺 Watch YouTube recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL3WYfXAiWI)\n\nIn our second session of the Python + MCP series, we deploy MCP servers to the cloud! We walk through the process of containerizing a FastMCP server with Docker and deploying to Azure Container Apps. Then we instrument the MCP server with OpenTelemetry and observe the tool calls using Azure Application Insights and Logfire. Finally, we explore private networking options for MCP servers, using virtual networks that restrict external access to internal MCP tools and agents.\n\n- [Slides for this session](https://aka.ms/pythonmcp/slides/deploying)\n- [Code repository with examples: python-mcp-demos](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-openai-demos)\n\n### Authentication for MCP servers\n\n[!\\[YouTube video\\](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_Redi3ChzFA/hqdefault.jpg) 📺 Watch YouTube recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Redi3ChzFA)\n\nIn our third session of the Python + MCP series, we explore the best ways to build authentication layers on top of your MCP servers. We start off simple, with an API key to gate access, and demonstrate a key-restricted FastMCP server deployed to Azure Functions. Then we move on to OAuth-based authentication for MCP servers that provide user-specific data. We dive deep into MCP authentication, which is built on top of OAuth2 but with additional requirements like PRM and DCR/CIMD, which can make it difficult to implement fully. We demonstrate the full MCP auth flow in the open-souce identity provider KeyCloak, and show how to use an OAuth proxy pattern to implement MCP auth on top of Microsoft Entra.\n\n- [Slides for this session](https://aka.ms/pythonai/slides/auth)\n- [Code repository with Container Apps examples: python-mcp-demos](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-openai-demos)\n- [Code repository with Functions examples: python-mcp-demos](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-sdk-functions-hosting-python)\n\nPublished Dec 19, 2025\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n[azure](/tag/azure?nodeId=board%3AAzureDevCommunityBlog)\n\n[mcp](/tag/mcp?nodeId=board%3AAzureDevCommunityBlog)\n\n[pamela fox](/tag/pamela%20fox?nodeId=board%3AAzureDevCommunityBlog)\n\n[python](/tag/python?nodeId=board%3AAzureDevCommunityBlog)\n\n[!\\[Pamela_Fox&#x27;s avatar\\](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/dS0xNjA0MDc4LTQxODI4MWk5MjkyQjFBMEVGOUE5NkM5?image-dimensions=50x50)](/users/pamela_fox/1604078) [Pamela_Fox](/users/pamela_fox/1604078) ![Icon for Microsoft rank](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/s/gxcuf89792/images/cmstNC05WEo0blc?image-dimensions=100x16&amp;constrain-image=true)Microsoft\n\nJoined November 08, 2022\n\n[View Profile](/users/pamela_fox/1604078)\n\n/category/azure/blog/azuredevcommunityblog [Microsoft Developer Community Blog](/category/azure/blog/azuredevcommunityblog) Follow this blog board to get notified when there's new activity",
