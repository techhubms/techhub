  "EnhancedContent": "You can now create **Agent Skills** to teach Copilot how to perform specialized tasks in a specific, repeatable way.\n\nAgent Skills are folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Copilot automatically loads when relevant to your prompt.\n\nThey work across Copilot coding agent, Copilot CLI, and agent mode in [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). Skills support is coming to the stable version of VS Code in early January.\n\nWhen Copilot determines a skill is relevant to your task, it loads the instructions and follows them—including any resources you’ve included in the skill directory.\n\nYou can write your own skills, or use skills shared by others, such as those in the [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repository or GitHub’s community created [`github/awesome-copilot`](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) collection.\n\nIf you’ve already set up skills for Claude Code in the `.claude/skills` directory in your repository, Copilot will pick them up automatically.\n\n📚 [Learn more about Agent Skills](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-agent-skills)\n\nJoin the discussion within [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).",
