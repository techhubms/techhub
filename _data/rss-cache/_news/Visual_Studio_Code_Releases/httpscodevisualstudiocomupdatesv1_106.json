Read about the new features and fixes from September.\n\nDismiss this update\n\n[Edit](https://vscode.dev/github/microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/main/release-notes/v1_106.md)\n\n# October 2025 (version 1.106)\n\n*Release date: November 12, 2025*\n\nDownloads: Windows: [x64](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/win32-x64-user/stable) [Arm64](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/win32-arm64-user/stable) | Mac: [Universal](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/darwin-universal/stable) [Intel](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/darwin/stable) [silicon](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/darwin-arm64/stable) | Linux: [deb](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/linux-deb-x64/stable) [rpm](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/linux-rpm-x64/stable) [tarball](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/linux-x64/stable) [Arm](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_previous-release-versions) [snap](https://update.code.visualstudio.com/1.106.0/linux-snap-x64/stable)\n\nWelcome to the October 2025 release of Visual Studio Code.\n\n![Graphic showing the key highlights of the October 2025 release: Agent HQ, Security and trust, and great editor experience.](/assets/updates/1_106/release-highlights.png)\n\nThis releases brings significant updates across three key areas:\n\n- **Agent HQ** is your single view to kick off, monitor, and review agent sessions, whether they're local or remote, from Copilot or OpenAI Codex\n- **Security and trust** help you stay in control and confidently delegate more tasks to AI\n- **A great editor experience** to make your day-to-day coding smoother and more enjoyable\n\nHappy Coding!\n\n>\n> If you'd like to read these release notes online, go to [Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) on [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com).\n> >\n\n>\n> **Insiders: Want to try new features as soon as possible?**\n>\n> You can download the nightly Insiders build and try the latest updates as soon as they are available.\n>\n> [Download Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)\n> >\n\n## Agents\n\n### Agent Sessions view\n\n**Setting**: [chat.agentSessionsViewLocation](vscode://settings/chat.agentSessionsViewLocation)\n\nAs you hand off tasks to various coding agents, it's important to have a clear overview of all your active sessions. The Agent Sessions view provides a centralized location for managing your active chat sessions. This includes both local sessions in VS Code and sessions created by background agents in other environments, such as [Copilot coding agent](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/), or [OpenAI's Codex](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OpenAI.chatgpt). The Agent Sessions view is now enabled by default, and can be managed via the [chat.agentSessionsViewLocation](vscode://settings/chat.agentSessionsViewLocation) setting.\n\nBy default, the Agent Sessions view lists all your active chat sessions organized by their source. The view is divided into sections for local chat sessions in VS Code and for background agent sessions:\n\n![Screenshot of the Agent Sessions view in the Primary Side Bar, showing a view for local chat sessions, and coding agents like Copilot coding agent, Copilot CLI and Codex.](/assets/updates/1_106/agent-sessions-view.png)\n\nIf you prefer to have one consolidated view of your sessions across all providers, you can enable the `single-view` option for the [chat.agentSessionsViewLocation](vscode://settings/chat.agentSessionsViewLocation) setting. This option also moves the Agent Sessions view next to the Chat view in the Secondary Side Bar, making it easier to switch between chat and managing your sessions.\n\nNote that not all functionality is available in the consolidated view yet. We are actively working on making this view the default in the near future.\n\nThe Agent Sessions view now also supports search (⌥⌘F (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+F)) to help you easily find your sessions in the list.\n\nLearn more about the [Agent Sessions view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-sessions/#_agent-sessions-view) in the VS Code documentation.\n\n### Plan agent\n\nA new plan agent helps developers break down complex tasks step-by-step before any code is written. Select **Plan** from the agents dropdown in the Chat view to get started. When tackling a multi-step implementation, VS Code prompts you with clarifying questions and generates a detailed implementation plan that you approve first, ensuring all requirements and context are captured upfront.\n\nWe recommend spending time iterating on the plan before implementation. You can refine requirements, adjust scope, and address open questions multiple times to build a solid foundation. Once you approve the plan, Copilot implements it either locally in VS Code or via [cloud agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-coding-agent), giving you greater control and visibility into the development process. This helps you catch gaps or missing decisions early, reducing rework and improving code quality.\n\nYou can also create your own custom plan agent tailored to your team's specific workflow and tools. Use the **Configure Custom Agent** menu to copy the built-in plan agent as a starting point, then customize the planning style, tools, and prompts to match your development process. Learn more about [planning in VS Code chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-planning) and [creating custom agents](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents).\n\n### Cloud agents\n\nIn this release, we have made quite a few updates to cloud agent sessions in the editor.\n\nWe migrated the Copilot coding agent integration from the GitHub Pull Request extension into the Copilot Chat extension to provide a more native cloud agent experience in VS Code. This integration paves the way for smoother transitions and interactions between VS Code and [GitHub Mission Control](https://github.com/copilot/agents), such as opening a cloud agent session directly from the Agent Sessions view in the browser and vice versa.\n\n### CLI agents\n\nIn this release, we have also shipped an initial integration with the [Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli/). You can create new and resume existing CLI agent sessions in a chat editor or an integrated terminal.\n\n![Screenshot of the CLI dropdown menu showing options to create a new CLI agent session or resume an existing one.](/assets/updates/1_106/cli-dropdown.png)\n\nIn a CLI agent editor, you can send messages to the Copilot CLI just as you would in a terminal, switch models, and attach context.\n\n![Screenshot showing a CLI agent editor and an integrated terminal with Copilot CLI sessions.](/assets/updates/1_106/cli-editor-and-terminal.png)\n\n### Agent delegation\n\nWe continue to improve the experience for delegating to cloud agents.\n\nWhen you use the cloud button to delegate to an agent from the chat panel, you'll be provided a set of available agents to which you can delegate. You can also delegate to the Copilot coding agent from the CLI, via the `/delegate` command in a CLI editor or terminal instance.\n\n![Screenshot showing delegating from a CLI agent editor.](/assets/updates/1_106/cli-delegate-editor.png)\n\n### CLI agent edit tracking\n\nChat edit sessions now track edits made by background agents, such as the Copilot CLI. When you create sessions from the Agent Sessions view, you can see edits tracked through both inline edit pills and the working set view, making it easier to understand what changes agents are making to your workspace.\n\n### Chat modes renamed to custom agents\n\nChat modes have been renamed to custom agents throughout VS Code to better align with terminology used in other environments.\n\n![Screenshot of the agent picker control.](/assets/updates/1_106/agent-picker.png)\n\nWhen you create custom agents, the definition files are now located in `.github/agents` in your workspace. These files can use the `.agents.md` suffix and can also be used as Github Copilot Cloud Agents and CLI Agent.\n\nUse **Chat: New Custom Agent...** to create a new agent and **Chat: Configure Custom Agents...** to manage them.\n\nIf you have existing custom chat modes (`.chatmode.md` files in `.github/chatmodes` ), they continue to work and are automatically treated as custom agents. When you open a chat agent file in the editor, a info marker appears on the first line with a quick fix to migrate it to a custom agent file.\n\n### Custom agent metadata\n\nCustom agent `.agent.md` files now accept an additional `target` frontmatter property to describe how an agent should run across environments:\n\n- `target: vscode`\n: optimizes the agent for local chat and unlocks `name` , `description` , `argument-hint` , `model` , `tools` , and `handoffs` properties. Any tool installed in VS Code can be used.\n- `target: github-copilot`\n: prepares the agent for Copilot cloud agents or the GitHub CLI with support for `name` , `description` , `tools` , `mcp-servers` , and `target` . Tools can be `edit` , `search` , `shell` , `custom-agent` , and tools from MCP servers\n\nAll agents can be run in all environments. Each environment ignores unknown attributes and tools.\n\n- `name`\n: lets you override the agent label without renaming the file.\n- `argument-hint`\n: surfaces guidance in the chat input so teammates know how to prompt the agent.\n- `handoffs`\n: wires guided transitions to other agents, letting you chain multi-step workflows.\n\nThe agent file editor provides validation, code completions, hovers and code actions.\n\n![GIF of validation while editing custom agent files.](/assets/updates/1_106/agent-file-editing.gif)\n\nLearn more about [custom agents and agent handoffs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents) in our documentation.\n\n## Code Editing\n\n### Deleted code in diff editor is now selectable\n\nPreviously, when you deleted code and viewed the changes in the diff editor, you couldn't copy those deleted lines. In this release, you can now select and copy text from deleted lines in the diff editor when using the inline diff view.\n\n### Inline suggestions are open source\n\nThis release continues our journey to make VS Code an open source AI editor. Following our first milestone of open sourcing GitHub Copilot Chat, we've now open sourced inline suggestions by merging them into the vscode-copilot-chat repository.\n\nAs part of this milestone, we're consolidating the GitHub Copilot extension and GitHub Copilot Chat extension into a single extension experience. The Chat extension now serves all inline suggestions, providing the same intelligent code suggestions you're used to while maintaining all chat and agent functionality. The change should be transparent, you'll continue getting the same code suggestions as you type. If you encounter any issues, you can temporarily revert using the [chat.extensionUnification.enabled](vscode://settings/chat.extensionUnification.enabled) setting.\n\nThe GitHub Copilot extension will be deprecated by early 2026. Learn more about this milestone and explore the open source code in our [blog post](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/11/04/openSourceAIEditorSecondMilestone).\n\n### Snooze inline suggestions from gutter\n\nYou can now snooze inline suggestions directly from the gutter icon. When you hover over the gutter icon, a control appears with a **Snooze** option. Select it and choose a duration to pause suggestions.\n\n![Screenshot showing the Snooze button in the gutter context menu for inline suggestions.](/assets/updates/1_106/nes-snooze.png)\n\n### Go to line improvements\n\nThis iteration, we've made several enhancements to the **Go to Line** command (⌃G (Windows, Linux Ctrl+G)), improving navigation within files.\n\nThe **Go to Line** command now supports navigating to a specific character position in a file by using the `::` syntax. This is useful when tools report errors at specific character offsets, such as \"error at position 599\".\n\nTo navigate to a character offset, type `::` followed by the character number in the **Go to Line** input box. For example:\n\n- `::599`\n- Navigate to character 599 in the file\n- `::-100`\n- Navigate 100 characters from the end of the file\n\nUse the toggle in the input box to switch between 1-based (default) and 0-based offset calculations.\n\nIn addition, the **Go to Line** command also handles out-of-range values more gracefully and makes it easier to navigate to the start or end of files and lines:\n\n- **Line numbers**: Typing a line number larger than the file's line count navigates to the last line.\n- **Column numbers**: Using negative column numbers navigates from the end of a line. For example, `:12:-1`\ntakes you to the last character on line 12. Typing a column number larger than the length of the line takes you to the end of the line.\n\n## Editor Experience\n\n### Refreshed iconography\n\nIn this release, the codicon icon set has had a facelift. The new icons have been refined with curves, new modifier designs, and more accurate metaphors to make them feel modern, friendly and more legible.\n\n![Screenshot of updated product icons showing a more modern appearance and increased legibility.](/assets/updates/1_106/refreshed-iconography.png)\n\n### Linux policy support\n\nWe've introduced support for managing VS Code policies on Linux systems using JSON files. This allows administrators to enforce specific settings and configurations across all users on a Linux machine.\n\nFor more details, see [JSON Policies on Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/enterprise#_json-policies-on-linux).\n\n### Navigate changes in multi file diff editor\n\nJust like you can navigate to next or previous changes in a diff editor for a single file, you can now do so across files in the multi-file diff editor. Use keybindings or the navigation up and down arrow keys to review your changes across files.\n\n### Copy diagnostic hover text\n\nA copy button now appears in diagnostic hovers (errors, warnings, info, and hints) to make copying error messages easier. When you hover over a diagnostic marker, move your mouse over the hover message to reveal a copy button in the top-right corner.\n\n![Screenshot of hovering over a diagnostic hover revealing a copy button in the top-right corner.](/assets/updates/1_106/hover-copy-button.png)\n\n### Accent-insensitive command filtering\n\nThe Command Palette now ignores character accents when searching for commands, making it easier to find what you need regardless of your keyboard layout or language preferences. For example, when searching for a command containing the word `Générer` (French for `Generate` ), type `generer` without accents and matching commands appear in the results.\n\nThis is helpful when using different keyboard layouts or when mistyping while looking for a command. The filtering is based on [Unicode Normalization Form D](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Norm_Forms) and supports all Unicode languages.\n\n### Advanced VS Code settings\n\nVS Code now supports the concept of advanced settings. These settings are meant for configuring specialized scenarios and are intended for advanced users who need fine-grained control over their environment. By default, advanced settings are hidden in the Settings editor, keeping the interface streamlined while making these powerful options available when needed.\n\nTo view and configure advanced settings, select **Advanced** from the filter dropdown menu in the Settings editor, or type `@tag:advanced` in the search box:\n\n![Screenshot showing the Settings editor with the Advanced filter applied, displaying advanced settings with the Advanced tag badge](/assets/updates/1_106/advanced-settings.png)\n\nWhen you search for a specific setting by its exact name or use the `@id:` filter, advanced settings appear in the results without having to apply the **Advanced** filter. This ensures you can always find the settings you're looking for.\n\nAdvanced settings can be combined with other filters such as `@modified` or `@feature:` to help you find exactly what you need. For example, `@tag:advanced @feature:terminal` shows only advanced settings related to the terminal.\n\n>\n> **Note:** Extension authors can mark their settings as advanced by adding the `advanced`\n> tag to the setting configuration.\n> >\n\n## Chat\n\n### Embeddings-based tool selection\n\nIn this release we've significantly improved how we filter and group tools for users that have many (over 100) tools enabled in chat. You should see the \"Optimizing tool selection...\" loading state less often and for a shorter period of time. We also improved tool selection with a lower probability of agent confusion to make sure the right tools are chosen.\n\n### Tool approvals and trust\n\n#### Post-approval for external data\n\nAgent tools that pull in external data now support post-approval. This helps protect against potential prompt injection attacks by letting you review the data before it's used in your chat session.\n\nPost-approval is enabled for the `#fetch` tool and for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that declare `openWorldHint` .\n\n#### Trust all tools for a server or extension\n\nYou can now trust MCP servers and extension tools at the source level through the **Allow** button dropdown. This means that you can approve all tools from a specific MCP server or extension at once, rather than having to approve each tool individually.\n\nWe have also updated the **Chat: Manage Tool Approval** command experience to let you manage both pre- and post-approval of tools.\n\n![Screenshot of the Manage Tool Approval command experience, enabling tools to skip approval and skipping content review.](/assets/updates/1_106/manage-tool-approvals.png)\n\n#### Tool auto approval status moved\n\nAuto approval status has moved from being inline inside the chat view to the tool call status/tick icon:\n\n![Screenshot of hovering a tool's tick icon will reveal why it was auto approved](/assets/updates/1_106/tool-auto-approve-hover.png)\n\n### Terminal tool\n\n#### Auto approve parser improvements\n\nPreviously, subcommand detection in the terminal tool used the naive approach of just splitting on certain strings such as `|` or `&&` . This failed in several ways but the bigger ones were when pipe was used inside strings like `echo \"a|b|c\"` , which would detect the subcommands `echo` , `b` and `c\"` . Another important one is that since we couldn't reliably pull subcommands, we outright banned paranthesis pairs, curly brace pairs, and backticks to be more on the safe side and prevent accidental execution.\n\nThis release, we integrated a [parser](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) into the feature and use a [PowerShell grammar](https://github.com/airbus-cert/tree-sitter-powershell) or a [bash grammar](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-bash) for everything else\\*. So, even really complex cases should be correctly extracted:\n\n![Screenshot of detecting &quot;$()&quot; inside echo calls.](/assets/updates/1_106/tool-terminal-parser.png)\n\n\\* *Note that this means it can fail to catch subcommands when the shell syntax differs from bash, such as `;` in zsh*\n\n#### File write/redirection detection (Experimental)\n\nThanks to the new parser, we're able to fairly reliably extract files being written to via redirection. There's the new experimental setting [chat.tools.terminal.blockDetectedFileWrites](vscode://settings/chat.tools.terminal.blockDetectedFileWrites) that will prevent auto approval conditionally.\n\n![Screenshot showing that writing outside the workspace by default will block auto approval.](/assets/updates/1_106/tool-terminal-redirection.png)\n\n#### Disable default auto approve rules (Experimental)\n\nThe new experimental setting [chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules](vscode://settings/chat.tools.terminal.ignoreDefaultAutoApproveRules) allows disabling the default rules (both allow and deny rules). This is useful if you want more control without needing to look up the defaults.\n\n#### Shell specific prompts and command rewriting\n\nThe terminal tool now has shell-specific descriptions for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish. This should make commands suggested by the agent more reliable and less likely to fail, especially for PowerShell.\n\nIn addition to this, for PowerShell we also re-write `&&` to `;` since the `&&` chain operator is not supported in Windows PowerShell (v5). Note that this is temporarily also happening for PowerShell 7 until [vscode#274548](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/274548) is actioned.\n\n#### Attach terminal commands to chat\n\nYou can now attach a terminal command to chat as context from the command decoration's context menu. The attachment shares the command line, captured output, and exit code so the agent understands precisely what happened. This applies to any command tracked by shell integration, making it easy to escalate troubleshooting without copying and pasting text.\n\n#### View terminal output inside chat (Experimental)\n\nThe new [chat.tools.terminal.outputLocation](vscode://settings/chat.tools.terminal.outputLocation) setting controls where the output is displayed. The default `none` value prevents the terminals from cluttering the panel.\n\nEvery chat terminal invocation now surfaces two actions on the progress element:\n\n- **Show Terminal** reveals and focuses hidden sessions, and with rich shell integration, scrolls directly to the relevant command. With basic or no shell integration, the action still focuses the correct terminal tab.\n- **Show Output** opens the terminal's final output inline within the chat view. The output view expands automatically when a command exits with a non-zero code.\n\nWhen `npm i` fails, the output is automatically expanded. The terminal is revealed with the **Show Terminal** inline action.\n\n#### Discover hidden chat terminals (Experimental)\n\nWhen `setting(chat.tools.terminal.outputLocation):none` , a new **X hidden terminal(s)** button appears in the terminal tabs view when there is at least one hidden chat terminal. It opens a quick pick that lists each chat terminal alongside its chat session so you can immediately focus the right process. The same picker is available from the terminal overflow menu under **View Hidden Chat Terminals**, and it disappears once all chat terminals are visible again.\n\nThe agent runs `ls -la` , which succeeds, so the output is collapsed. The **hidden terminal** action is taken from the tabs view and the terminal is selected, revealed, and scrolled to highlight the command.\n\n### Save conversation as prompt\n\nYou can now save your chat conversations as reusable prompts with the `/savePrompt` command. When you invoke `/savePrompt` in an active chat session, VS Code generates a prompt file containing a generalized prompt based on your conversation. The editor displays a blue button that lets you save this prompt to a valid location, either at the user or workspace level.\n\n![Screenshot of the Save prompt button in the editor.](/assets/updates/1_106/save-prompt-prompt.png)\n\nThis feature replaces the previous `/save` command and provides a more streamlined workflow for capturing and sharing useful conversation patterns. The generated prompts can be easily reused in future chat sessions or shared with your team. Learn more about [custom prompt files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files).\n\n### Edit welcome prompts\n\nYou can now right-click on suggested prompts in the Chat welcome view to access additional actions. When you right-click a prompt (or press Shift+F10), a context menu appears with an **Edit Prompt File** option to open the corresponding prompt file directly in the editor.\n\nEditing a prompt file works for prompts that have an associated file, including user-defined prompts and project-specific prompts configured through the [chat.promptFilesRecommendations](vscode://settings/chat.promptFilesRecommendations) setting.\n\n![Screenshot of a context menu for a suggested prompt.](/assets/updates/1_106/welcome-prompt-context.png)\n\nLearn more about [custom prompt files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files).\n\n### Automatically open edited files\n\n**Setting**: [chat.openEditedFilesAutomatically](vscode://settings/chat.openEditedFilesAutomatically)\n\nWe changed the default behavior of the agent to no longer automatically open edited files in an editor. If you prefer the previous behavior, you can enable the setting [accessibility.openChatEditedFiles](vscode://settings/accessibility.openChatEditedFiles).\n\n### Reasoning (Experimental)\n\n**Setting**: [chat.agent.thinkingStyle](vscode://settings/chat.agent.thinkingStyle), [chat.agent.thinking.collapsedTools](vscode://settings/chat.agent.thinking.collapsedTools)\n\nLast iteration, we added the [chat.agent.thinkingStyle](vscode://settings/chat.agent.thinkingStyle) setting which enabled displaying thinking tokens in chat. This is now available in more models! As of this release, GPT-5-Codex, GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, and Gemini 2.5 Pro support this.\n\nThe [chat.agent.thinkingStyle](vscode://settings/chat.agent.thinkingStyle) was adjusted to three more common styles, with `fixedScrolling` as the default to show the most recent chain of thoughts.\n\nAn additional setting, [chat.agent.thinking.collapsedTools](vscode://settings/chat.agent.thinking.collapsedTools), adds tool calls into the collapsible thinking UI.\n\n![Screenshot showing reasoning tokens displayed in chat with interweaved tool cals and reasoning output. This is the UI with and for the respective thinking settings.](/assets/updates/1_106/reasoning.png)\n\n### Inline chat v2 (Preview)\n\n**Setting**: [inlineChat.enableV2](vscode://settings/inlineChat.enableV2)\n\nWe have ramped up our efforts to modernize inline chat. It's built to be\n\n- single prompt,\n- single file,\n- and for code changes only\n\nThis makes the overall experience much lighter and allows for a simplified UI. For tasks it cannot handle, you'll be automatically upgraded to the Chat view.\n\n### Chat view UX improvements\n\nWe tweaked some parts of the Chat view to make it feel more pleasant to use:\n\n- The action to create a new Chat is now a dropdown with options to create a chat session in the editor or in a new window\n- The tools and MCP server actions moved right next to the model picker\n- The configuration dropdown is cleaned up\n\n![Screenshot of the action to create a new chat dropdown menu.](/assets/updates/1_106/chat-view.png)\n\nIt is now also possible to copy math source by right-clicking math expressions in the chat view.\n\n## MCP\n\n### MCP server access for your organization\n\n**Settings**: [chat.mcp.gallery.serviceUrl](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.gallery.serviceUrl), [chat.mcp.access](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.access)\n\nVS Code now supports MCP registry configured through GitHub organization policies. This enables organizations to set up a custom MCP registry and control which MCP servers can be installed and started.\n\nWhen an MCP registry endpoint is configured in your organization's policies, VS Code will:\n\n- Provide browsing and installing of MCP servers from the configured registry\n- Restrict starting MCP servers to only those available in the registry when access restriction is enabled\n\nWhen your organization has configured these policies, the [chat.mcp.gallery.serviceUrl](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.gallery.serviceUrl) setting specifies the MCP registry endpoint URL, and the [chat.mcp.access](vscode://settings/chat.mcp.access) setting controls whether access is restricted to only the servers in that registry. These settings will be marked as \"(Managed by organization)\" in the Settings editor:\n\n![Screenshot showing MCP settings managed by organization policy, including the Gallery Service URL and Access control settings](/assets/updates/1_106/mcp-registry-policies.png)\n\nTo learn more about configuring MCP server access for your organization or enterprise, see [Configure MCP server access](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/configure-mcp-server-access).\n\n### Install MCP servers to workspace configuration\n\nWhen installing an MCP server, you can now choose whether to install it globally or to the workspace configuration. Right-click on an MCP server in the extensions view and select **Install (Workspace)** from the context menu, or use the **Install (Workspace)** action directly in the MCP server editor. This adds the MCP server to the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your current workspace, making it easier to share MCP servers with your team.\n\n![Screenshot showing the context menu for an MCP server with the Install (Workspace) option highlighted](/assets/updates/1_106/mcp-install-workspace.png)\n\n### Authentication: Client ID Metadata Document authentication flow\n\nAuthentication support for remote MCPs now supports the [Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD)](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-parecki-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00.html) authentication flow, which is the future standard for OAuth in MCP. This flow enables a more secure and scaleable solution to authentication over [Dynamic Client Registiration (DCR)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) because now authorization servers do not have to worry about issuing client IDs per-client.\n\nWhen connecting to an MCP server that uses an authorization server that supports CIMD, VS Code will automatically use that flow over DCR.\n\n*For more information about CIMD, take a look at [the resources on oauth.net](https://oauth.net/2/client-id-metadata-document/).*\n\n### Authentication: `WWW-Authenticate`\nscope step up\n\nAuthentication support for remote MCPs now supports dynamic scope escalation through the `WWW-Authenticate` header for remote MCP servers. This is called out in [the OAuth 2.0 specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750#section-3). This allows MCP servers to request additional permissions when needed, rather than requiring all scopes upfront. For example, connecting to a server might require a minimal set of scopes, but specific tool calls can request broader permissions only when necessary. This provides better security by following the principle of least privilege.\n\n*This is currently called out in the [latest draft of the MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization#scope-selection-strategy) which is expected to be finalized soon.*\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Speech timeout is disabled by default\n\nThe configuration [accessibility.voice.speechTimeout](vscode://settings/accessibility.voice.speechTimeout) has changed to be `0` by default. This means, a voice session no longer ends automatically after a certain delay (e.g. a Chat request would not be triggered automatically if you pause). We feel this is a better default experience, but you can always change back to the previous default (`2500` ).\n\n### Chat input improvements\n\nThe chat input now announces the active agent and model in a clearer order so screen reader users hear the most relevant context first. The chat accessibility help also calls out that you can press **Delete** to remove attached context items, making attachment management fully keyboard-accessible.\n\n## Notebooks\n\n### Notebook search\n\nNotebooks now supports searching across cells. Use key bindings (⌘G (Windows, Linux F3) and ⇧⌘G (Windows, Linux Shift+F3)) to navigate to the next and previous match, just like you would in the editor.\n\n## Source Control\n\n### Folding support in git commit messages\n\n**Settings**: [git.verboseCommit](vscode://settings/git.verboseCommit), [git.useEditorAsCommitInput](vscode://settings/git.useEditorAsCommitInput)\n\nWhen writing git commit messages in the editor, you can now fold sections of the commit message to keep things organized. To use this feature, enable the [git.verboseCommit](vscode://settings/git.verboseCommit) and [git.useEditorAsCommitInput](vscode://settings/git.useEditorAsCommitInput) settings.\n\n![Screenshot showing folding nodes in the gutter and a partially collapsed commit message in the editor.](/assets/updates/1_106/commit-folding.png)\n\n### Graph incoming/outgoing changes\n\n**Settings**: [scm.graph.showIncomingChanges](vscode://settings/scm.graph.showIncomingChanges), [scm.graph.showOutgoingChanges](vscode://settings/scm.graph.showOutgoingChanges)\n\nThis milestone, we are adding the capability to easily view incoming and outgoing changes in the Source Control Graph view. For active branches that have incoming or outgoing changes, the graph displays an \"Incoming Changes\" and \"Outgoing Changes\" node. Selecting each node displays the list of incoming or outgoing files.\n\n![Screenshot showing incoming and outgoing changes nodes in the Source Control Graph view.](/assets/updates/1_106/graph-incoming-outgoing.png)\n\nYou can hide this information from the Graph view by using the [scm.graph.showIncomingChanges](vscode://settings/scm.graph.showIncomingChanges) and [scm.graph.showOutgoingChanges](vscode://settings/scm.graph.showOutgoingChanges) settings.\n\n### Graph compare references\n\nWe have added a new command to the Source Control Graph context menu, **Compare with...**, that enables you to compare a history item in the graph with an arbitrary branch or tag. This feature lets you view changes that are in the history item but not in the branch or tag.\n\nIn the context menu, there are shortcuts commands, **Compare with Remote** and **Compare with Merge Base** for comparing a history item with the remote branch and merge base respectively.\n\n### Repositories selection mode\n\n**Setting**: [scm.repositories.selectionMode](vscode://settings/scm.repositories.selectionMode)\n\nThe Source Control Repositories view shows the list of opened repositories in the workspace and is used to control the repositories shown in the Source Control Changes view.\n\nWe are looking to expand the functionality of the Repositories view and in preparation for that, we are introducing a setting, [scm.repositories.selectionMode](vscode://settings/scm.repositories.selectionMode), to control the selection mode in the Repositories view to either a single repository or multiple repositories.\n\nApart from the new functionality in the Repositories view, this also allows us to remove the repository picker in the Graph view's title and have a global repository picker across all source control views. You can toggle the selection mode using the setting, or from the \"...\" menu of the Repositories view.\n\n![Screenshot showing the Repositories view with single selection mode enabled and the context menu to toggle selection mode.](/assets/updates/1_106/repositories-selection-mode.png)\n\n### Repositories explorer (experimental)\n\n**Settings**: [scm.repositories.explorer](vscode://settings/scm.repositories.explorer), [scm.repositories.selectionMode](vscode://settings/scm.repositories.selectionMode)\n\nWe are looking at enhancing the Repositories view and showing additional information for each repository. To try out this experimental feature, set [scm.repositories.selectionMode](vscode://settings/scm.repositories.selectionMode) and [scm.repositories.explorer](vscode://settings/scm.repositories.explorer).\n\nIn this first iteration, we have focused on branches and tags. You can create new branches, tags, view the list of branches and tags, and take various actions of each branch/tag (ex: checkout, etc.). In the upcoming milestone, we will add more information (ex: stashes, remotes, etc). Give this experimental feature a try and let us know what you think.\n\n![Screenshot showing the Repositories explorer with branches and tags for a single selected repository.](/assets/updates/1_106/repositories-explorer.png)\n\n## Testing\n\n### Navigate uncovered lines in test coverage\n\nWhen reviewing test coverage, you can now easily navigate between uncovered lines using new navigation commands. Two commands are available in the editor toolbar when viewing coverage information:\n\n- **Go to Next Uncovered Line** - Jumps to the next line that is not covered by tests\n- **Go to Previous Uncovered Line** - Jumps to the previous line that is not covered by tests\n\nThese commands help you quickly identify coverage gaps and focus on areas that need additional test coverage, making it easier to improve the overall test quality of your codebase.\n\n## Terminal\n\n### Terminal IntelliSense\n\nTerminal IntelliSense has been in the product as an experimental/preview feature [for around 1.5 years](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_89#_vs-codenative-intellisense-for-powershell)! This release we're removing the preview tag and will be doing a staged roll out as the default to all users on stable.\n\nWhen enabled, typing in the terminal will bring up IntelliSense similar to the editor for PowerShell, bash, zsh and fish:\n\n![Screenshot of typing &quot;write&quot; in PowerShell will bring up completions starting with the word write.](/assets/updates/1_106/terminal-suggest-write.png)\n\nThe completions have various sources, paths for example are all handled by core:\n\nSome commands feature advanced specifications, like git which has the ability to pull in branch names:\n\nIf we learned anything when building this feature it's that no one size fits all, so there are many options to tweak the behavior to get what you're after:\n\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions) - Show automatically depending on the content of the command line, as opposed to manually via Ctrl+Space.\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.suggestOnTriggerCharacters](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.suggestOnTriggerCharacters) - Show automatically after a \"trigger character\" such as `-`\nor `/` .\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.runOnEnter) - Optionally run the command when Enter is used (not Tab).\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.windowsExecutableExtensions](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.windowsExecutableExtensions) - The list of extensions that are treated as executables on Windows.\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.providers](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.providers) - Provides the ability to disable specific providers, for example extensions may contribute completions you don't want.\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.showStatusBar](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.showStatusBar) - Whether to show the status bar at the bottom of the IntelliSense popup.\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.cdPath](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.cdPath) - Whether to enable `$CDPATH`\nintegration.\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.inlineSuggestion) - Whether to integrate with shell \"ghost text\" and how to present it.\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.upArrowNavigatesHistory](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.upArrowNavigatesHistory) - Whether up arrow is sent to the shell instead of browsing completions, this is particularly useful on zsh where you can filter and then press up to do a history search with that prefix.\n- [terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.selectionMode) - How the Intellisense popup is focused which determines what Enter and Tab do.\n- (New!) [terminal.integrated.suggest.insertTrailingSpace](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.insertTrailingSpace) - Insert a trailing space and re-trigger completions after accepting.\n\nIf you are don't see the feature yet, make sure you have [shell integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration) enabled and enable IntelliSense explicitly in settings via [terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled).\n\nApart from overall polish, this is what is coming to the feature this release:\n\n- `copilot`\nand `azd` CLIs now have completions\n- The extension API is close to finalization\n- Git commit completions show the commit message\n\n![Screenshot of git commit completions showing branch names and their associated commit messages in the terminal suggest details view.](/assets/updates/1_106/terminal-suggest-commit.png)\n\n### Consolidated shell integration timeout setting\n\nWe now have one unified configurable setting, [terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.timeout](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.timeout), that controls how long VS Code waits for shell integration to become ready before executing commands in the terminal, including those triggered through the executeCommand API and by Copilot terminal tool.\n\n[chat.tools.terminal.shellIntegrationTimeout](vscode://settings/chat.tools.terminal.shellIntegrationTimeout) has been deprecated in favor of this consolidation.\n\n## Authentication\n\n### Manage extension account preferences discoverability\n\nThe **Manage Extension Account Preferences** command is now more discoverable. In addition to being available in the Command Palette and extension context menus, it now appears in the Account Menu alongside **Manage Language Model Access**. This makes it easier to find and configure which accounts extensions can access.\n\n![Screenshot of Manage Extension Account Preferences in the Account menu.](/assets/updates/1_106/manageExtensionAccountPref.png)\n\n### Last version of `classic`\nMicrosoft authentication - use `msal-no-broker` if you experience issues\n\nWe will be removing the `classic` option for [microsoft-authentication.implementation](vscode://settings/microsoft-authentication.implementation). This means that VS Code release 1.106 is the final version that has the `classic` option.\n\nThe [microsoft-authentication.implementation](vscode://settings/microsoft-authentication.implementation) setting has been around to let users opt-out of native brokered authentication for Microsoft accounts if they experienced issues. The values for this setting are:\n\n- `msal`\n- Use MSAL with brokered authentication when available (default)\n- `msal-no-broker`\n- Use MSAL without brokered authentication (introduced recently)\n- `classic`\n- Use the classic Microsoft authentication flow without MSAL\n\nWe will remove the `classic` option since it's usage is very low and most issues with the `msal` option are due to the brokering, which is remedied with `msal-no-broker` .\n\n### Device code flow for Microsoft authentication\n\nMicrosoft authentication now supports the device code flow in non-brokered scenarios, particularly useful for remote development environments. When other authentication methods fail, VS Code automatically falls back to device code flow, which displays a code that you can enter on another device to complete authentication.\n\n### Manage accounts command\n\nManage your authentication accounts directly from the Command Palette using the **Accounts: Manage Accounts** command. This command provides access to account management features when the Account menu is hidden or not easily accessible.\n\n![Screenshot of the Manage Accounts menu.](/assets/updates/1_106/manage-accounts-menu.png)\n\nWhen you run the **Manage Accounts** command, you'll see a quick pick menu listing all your active accounts. You can select an account to view available actions, including:\n\n- **Manage Trusted Extensions** - Control which extensions can access the selected account\n- **Manage Trusted MCP Servers** - Manage MCP server access permissions for accounts that support this capability\n- **Sign Out** - Sign out of the account\n\n## Languages\n\n### Python\n\n#### Python Environments Extension: Support for python.poetryPath setting\n\nThe Python Environments Extension now respects the existing `python.poetryPath` user setting. This allows you to specify which Poetry executable to use. The provided path will be searched for and selected when managing Poetry environments.\n\n#### Python Environments Extension: Improved venv creation: dev-requirements.txt detection\n\nWhen creating a new virtual environment, the extension now detects both requirements.txt and dev-requirements.txt files and installs dependencies automatically.\n\n#### Add Copilot Hover Summaries as docstring\n\nYou can now add your AI-generated documentation directly into your code as a docstring using the new **Add as docstring** command in Copilot Hover Summaries. When you generate a summary for a function or class, navigate to the symbol definition and hover over it to access the **Add as docstring** command, which inserts the summary below your cursor formatted as a proper docstring.\n\nThis streamlines the process of documenting your code, allowing you to quickly enhance readability and maintainability without retyping.\n\n#### Localized Copilot Hover Summaries\n\nGitHub Copilot Hover Summaries inside Pylance now respect your display language within VS Code. When you invoke an AI-generated summary, you'll get strings in the language you've set for your editor, making it easier to understand the generated documentation.\n\n![Screenshot of a Copilot Hover Summary generated in Portuguese.](/assets/updates/1_106/hover-summaries-in-portuguese.png)\n\n#### Convert wildcard imports Code Action\n\nWildcard imports (from module import \\*) are often discouraged in Python because they can clutter your namespace and make it unclear where names come from, reducing code clarity and maintainability. Pylance now helps you clean up modules that still rely on `from module import *` via a new Code Action. It replaces the wildcard with the explicit symbols, preserving aliases and keeping the import to a single statement. To try it out, you can click on the line with the wildcard import and press Ctrl+. (or Cmd+. on macOS) to select the **Convert to explicit imports** Code Action.\n\n![Screenshot of the Convert wildcard imports Code Action.](/assets/updates/1_106/wildcard-import.png)\n\n### dotenv\n\nThere is built in basic support for dotenv files (`.env` ), which are commonly used to define environment variables for applications.\n\n## Contributions to extensions\n\n### GitHub Pull Requests\n\nThere has been more progress on the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension, which enables you to work on, create, and manage pull requests and issues. New features include:\n\n- AI-generated PR descriptions (via [githubPullRequests.pullRequestDescription](vscode://settings/githubPullRequests.pullRequestDescription)) will respect the repository PR template if there is one.\n- Drafts in the Pull Requests view now render in italics instead of having a `[DRAFT]`\nprefix.\n- Pull requests can be opened from from a url, for example: `vscode-insiders://github.vscode-pull-request-github/checkout-pull-request?uri=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/pull/460`\n\nReview the [changelog for the 0.122.0](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#01220) release of the extension to learn about everything in the release.\n\n## Preview Features\n\n### Language Models editor\n\nA new **Language Models** editor provides a centralized place to view and manage all available language models for GitHub Copilot Chat. You can open it from the chat model picker or via the command **Chat: Manage Language Models**.\n\n>\n> **Note:** This feature is only available in [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).\n> >\n\n![Screenshot showing the Language Models editor with a list of models organized by provider.](/assets/updates/1_106/language-models-editor.png)\n\nThe editor displays:\n\n- All available models organized by provider\n- Model capabilities (tools, vision, agent)\n- Context size and multiplier information\n- Model visibility status\n\nYou can search and filter models using:\n\n- Text search with highlighting\n- Provider filter: `@provider:\"OpenAI\"`\n- Capability filters: `@capability:tools`\n, `@capability:vision` , `@capability:agent`\n- Visibility filter: `@visible:true/false`\n\nHover over model names or context sizes to see detailed information including model ID, version, status, and token breakdown.\n\n#### Manage model visibility\n\nControl which models appear in the chat model picker by toggling their visibility with the eye icon next to each model. When a model is visible, it appears in the model picker dropdown when you're using GitHub Copilot Chat, making it available for selection. Hidden models remain in the Language Models editor but won't appear in the model picker, helping you keep your model selection focused on the ones you use most frequently.\n\n![Screenshot showing the eye icon to toggle model visibility with a tooltip displaying &quot;Show in the chat model picker&quot;](/assets/updates/1_106/toggle-language-model-visibility.png)\n\nThis is particularly useful when you have access to many models and want to streamline your workflow by showing only your preferred models in the picker.\n\n#### Add models from installed providers\n\nUse the **Add Models...** button to configure and add models from language model providers you've already installed. When you select this button, you'll see a dropdown list of all installed model providers, such as Copilot, Anthropic, Azure, Google, Groq, Ollama, OpenAI, and others. Select a provider from the list to configure it and start using its models in GitHub Copilot Chat.\n\n![Screenshot showing the Add Models dropdown with a list of installed language model providers including Copilot, Anthropic, Azure, Google, and more](/assets/updates/1_106/add-language-models-dropdown.png)\n\nThis makes it easy to activate additional model providers you've installed without needing to navigate away from the Language Models editor. Access provider management by selecting the gear icon on provider rows.\n\n## Extension Authoring\n\n### ID token in authentication sessions\n\nThe `AuthenticationSession` interface now includes an optional `idToken` property. This allows authentication providers to return ID tokens in addition to access tokens, which is particularly useful for scenarios that require user identity information. The Microsoft authentication provider returns this field, while other providers like GitHub may not.\n\nID tokens contain claims about the authenticated user and are signed by the identity provider, making them useful for verifying user identity. For more information about the difference between ID tokens and access tokens, see [https://oauth.net/id-tokens-vs-access-tokens/](https://oauth.net/id-tokens-vs-access-tokens/).\n\n``` export interface AuthenticationSession { /**\n* The ID token.\n*/ readonly idToken?: string; }\n\n```\n\n### Git extension `getRepositoryWorkspace`\nAPI\n\nThe build in Git extension offers new API for getting a folder that's known to be associated with a git repository remote. This works by caching a repository-remote to folder mapping when the user opens a folder with a git remote.\n\n### View containers in Secondary Side Bar\n\nExtension authors can now register view containers in the Secondary Side Bar by using the new `secondarySidebar` contribution point. This lets extensions place their custom views alongside built-in views like Chat in the Secondary Side Bar and provide a better integration with VS Code's dual side bar layout.\n\n``` { \"contributes\": { \"viewsContainers\": { \"secondarySidebar\": [ { \"id\": \"myExtensionViews\", \"title\": \"My Extension\", \"icon\": \"$(extensions)\" } ] }, \"views\": { \"myExtensionViews\": [ { \"id\": \"myCustomView\", \"name\": \"Custom View\", \"when\": \"true\" } ] } } }\n\n```\n\n## Proposed APIs\n\n### Quick Pick and Quick Input improvements\n\nThe Quick Pick and Quick Input APIs include several new capabilities that give extension developers more flexibility in creating interactive user interfaces.\n\n#### Proposed API: Toggle button support\n\nExtensions can add toggle buttons to Quick Pick and Quick Input interfaces through the `toggles` property on `QuickInput` . This enables scenarios like a password visibility toggle in the input box area, allowing users to interact with controls without leaving the quick pick interface.\n\nYour comments and feedback on this API proposal are appreciated (please refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/144956)).\n\n``` export enum QuickInputButtonLocation { ...\n\n/**\n* The button is rendered at the far end inside the input box.\n*/ Input = 3 }\n\nexport interface QuickInputButton { ...\n\n/**\n* When present, indicates that the button is a toggle button that can be checked or unchecked.\n*\n* **Note:** This property is currently only applicable to buttons with {@link QuickInputButtonLocation.Input} location.\n* It must be set for such buttons, and the state will be updated when the button is toggled.\n* It cannot be set for buttons with other location values.\n*/ readonly toggle?: { checked: boolean }; }\n\n```\n\n#### Proposed API: Prompt support for Quick Pick\n\nQuick Pick supports a `prompt` property, similar to the one available in Input Box. The prompt displays persistent text beneath the input box that remains visible while users type, providing helpful guidance or instructions that doesn't disappear when the user starts entering text.\n\nYour comments and feedback on this API proposal are appreciated (please refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/78335)).\n\n``` export interface QuickPick<T extends QuickPickItem> extends QuickInput { /**\n* Optional text that provides instructions or context to the user.\n*\n* The prompt is displayed below the input box and above the list of items.\n*/ prompt: string | undefined; }\n\nexport interface QuickPickOptions { /**\n* Optional text that provides instructions or context to the user.\n*\n* The prompt is displayed below the input box and above the list of items.\n*/ prompt?: string; }\n\n```\n\n#### Proposed API: File icons for Quick Pick items\n\nQuick Pick items can display file-type-specific icons through the `resourceUri` property on `QuickPickItem` . When you provide a resource URI, VS Code automatically derives the appropriate label, description, and icon based on the resource type, matching your current theme's file icon set. This is particularly useful when building file or folder selection interfaces, as users can quickly identify items by their familiar file type icons.\n\nYour comments and feedback on this API proposal are appreciated (please refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/59826)).\n\n``` export interface QuickPickItem { /**\n* A {@link Uri} representing the resource associated with this item.\n*\n* When set, this property is used to automatically derive several item properties if they are not explicitly provided:\n* - **Label**: Derived from the resource's file name when {@link QuickPickItem.label label} is not provided or is empty.\n* - **Description**: Derived from the resource's path when {@link QuickPickItem.description description} is not provided or is empty.\n* - **Icon**: Derived from the current file icon theme when {@link QuickPickItem.iconPath iconPath} is set to\n* {@link ThemeIcon.File} or {@link ThemeIcon.Folder}.\n*/ resourceUri?: Uri; }\n\n```\n\n### GitHub-style alerts in MarkdownStrings ([#209652](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/209652))\n\nWe have added support for rendering [GitHub-style alert syntax](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925) in `MarkdownString` by setting a new property `supportAlertSyntax` .\n\n``` const markdown = new vscode.MarkdownString(); markdown.supportAlertSyntax = true; markdown.value = `\n> [!NOTE]\n> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.\n`;\n\n```\n\nThis enables extensions to render alerts in various places in the UI, such as comments:\n\n![Screenshot showing GitHub-style alerts displayed in a comment thread showing each alert type with their respective icons and styling.](/assets/updates/1_106/markdown-alerts.png)\n\n### MarkdownString support in TreeItem labels ([#115365](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/115365))\n\nExtension authors can now use `MarkdownString` in tree view item labels, enabling a subset of Markdown syntax including codicons and text formatting. This allows extensions to create more visually rich tree views.\n\n``` // Codicons const itemWithIcon = new vscode.TreeItem({ label: new vscode.MarkdownString('$(star) Starred item', true) });\n\n// Text formatting (must surround the entire string) const italicItem = new vscode.TreeItem({ label: new vscode.MarkdownString('_Italic item_') });\n\n// Formatting and codicons can be combined const combined = new vscode.TreeItem({ label: new vscode.MarkdownString('_~~**$(check) Done $(star)**~~_', true) });\n\n```\n\nThe above items render as: ![Screenshot of a tree view showing three items: a starred item with an icon, an italic item, and a combined item with check and star icons plus bold, italic, and strikethrough formatting.](/assets/updates/1_106/markdown-labels.png)\n\n## Engineering\n\n### Exploration of automated UX PR testing\n\nWe've introduced a new automation workflow that helps reviewers understand UI changes in pull requests without manually checking out and running the code. By adding the `~copilot-video-please` label to a pull request with UI changes, an automated process kicks off that:\n\n- Builds VS Code from the PR branch\n- Uses GitHub Copilot CLI to interact with the changes and record a video along the way - leveraging [playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)\n- Generates a Playwright trace for detailed inspection\n- Posts the results as a comment on the PR\n\nWhile it's still early, this workflow can reduce the manual effort required for code review, especially for small UI changes. The videos and traces help reviewers quickly verify that changes work as expected.
