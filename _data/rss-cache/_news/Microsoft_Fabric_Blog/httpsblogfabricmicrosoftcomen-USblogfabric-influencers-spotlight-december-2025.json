  "EnhancedContent": "Welcome to the December 2025 edition of the Fabric Influencers Spotlight, a recurring monthly post here to shine a bright light on the places on the internet where Microsoft MVPs & Fabric Super Users are doing some amazing work on all aspects of Microsoft Fabric.\n\nThe Microsoft Fabric Community team has created the Fabric Influencers Spotlight to highlight and amplify blog posts, videos, presentations, and other content related to Microsoft Fabric. We’ve cultivated submissions from members of Microsoft MVPs & Fabric Super Users from the Fabric community that cover the Fabric Platform, Data Engineering & Data Science in Fabric, Data Warehousing, Power BI, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Integration, Fabric Administration & Governance and Databases.\n\nMicrosoft Most Valuable Professionals, or MVPs, are technology experts who utilize their deep knowledge of Microsoft products and services to bring together diverse platforms, products, and solutions, to solve real world problems, and to bring “leading edge” content to the data community. To learn about the Microsoft MVP Award and to find MVPs, visit the [official website](https://mvp.microsoft.com/).\n\nFabric Super Users are the heroes of the Fabric Community. They contribute helpful answers, write informative blog posts, post data stories and are key contributors to the Fabric product via engagement with the product group. To learn more about the Super User program, visit the [official website](https://aka.ms/SuperUsers).\n\n## Data Warehouse\n\n### Aleksi Partanen, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksi-partanen/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Understanding Microsoft Fabric Warehouse](https://youtu.be/DKRfvGz0v54)\n\nThis video introduces Microsoft Fabric Warehouse with clear explanations and hands on demos, showing how it combines a familiar relational SQL experience with Delta tables in OneLake. It explains what makes Fabric Warehouse unique, including ingestion options, cross database queries, time travel, and zero copy cloning. The episode also walks through core SQL objects, querying tools, and the visual query editor, followed by practical demonstrations of the main features.\n\n### Kevin Chant, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-chant/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [The F-Files Podcast – Episode 001 Past Perfect: The Art of Historical Data Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6tA5nyU4FU)\n\nIn this episode of the F-Files, we dive deep into the timeless value of historical data tracking in the world of modern analytics. Microsoft Fabric offers powerful tools to not only capture current data but also preserve its past—perfectly. Based on one of the practice questions for the DP-700 exam.\n\n## Power BI\n\n### Rishi Sapra, [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rsaprano)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [Power BI MCP Server: How Context Engineering Changes Everything](https://msfabrictraining.com/power-bi-mcp-server-how-context-engineering-changes-everything/)\n\nThe Power BI MCP server (the “hands”) can be combined with a foundation LLM (“the Brain”) in agent mode to completely transform the way we work with Power BI and Fabric. In this blog post, Rishi shows snippets from the demo at Fabcon highlighting how providing the right level of context to instructions/prompts yields incredibly powerful results.\n\n### Parul Sagar, [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/parul-rani-sagar)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog: [When Semi-Additive Metrics Fall Short: Why You Need Sequence Logic for Continuous-Day Engagement](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Power-BI-Community-Blog/When-Semi-Additive-Metrics-Fall-Short-Why-You-Need-Sequence/ba-p/4894989)\n\nUnderstanding user behavior in learning systems, SaaS platforms, or product telemetry often starts with semi-additive calculations. But semi-additive metrics only tell what happened at a point in time. They do not reveal behavioral continuity. To address this, a solution requires sequence analysis, specifically using run-length encoding through DAX or SQL window functions.\n\n## Data Engineering\n\n### Jake Duddy, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakeduddy/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [Fabric Graphs](https://evaluationcontext.github.io/posts/FabricGraph/)\n\nGraph databases allow us to model data in a way that allows us to answer questions that are hard and expensive when compared to traditional tabular databases. Fabric Graph provides an easy way to build graphs on top of one-lake. This blog looks at how to model a Fabric tenant to ask questions like: What permissions does someone have on different items? What reports can we recommend to people? If a job fails or we want to delete an item, what downstream artifacts and users are affected?\n\n### Matthias Falland, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-falland)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Fabric IQ – Introduction, Architecture & Full Hands-On Workshop](https://youtu.be/VgJvDastcb0)\n\nThis Fabric Friday episode introduces Fabric IQ as a new ontology-based semantic foundation in Microsoft Fabric that goes beyond traditional semantic models. By defining entities, properties, and verb-based relationships, it creates an enterprise-wide vocabulary that enables deeper LLM understanding and cross-domain reasoning. The session walks through use cases, an end-to-end workflow, and a hands-on demo with Lakehouse and Eventhouse. Key takeaway: ontologies and semantic models are complementary, especially for complex and real-time scenarios.\n\n## Data Science\n\n### Gaston Cruz, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gastoncruz)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Microsoft Fabric Data Agents Just Leveled Up — New Creator Features Explained](https://youtu.be/asAG2u1xh3A)\n\nMicrosoft Fabric just delivered major upgrades for creators working with Data Agents — and they’re a game changer! In this video, we break down the latest Creator Improvements in Microsoft Fabric Data Agents, including smarter agent design, easier data orchestration, improved UI, and new capabilities that make building intelligent data experiences faster and more powerful than ever.\n\n### Sahir Maharaj, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahir-maharaj/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nBlog: [Autoencoder Dimensionality Reduction for Data Science in Microsoft Fabric](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Science-Community-Blog/Autoencoder-Dimensionality-Reduction-for-Data-Science-in/ba-p/4899083)\n\nIn this edition, we’re exploring autoencoders and why they’re such a powerful way to reduce dimensionality when your data starts getting a little too wide. By the time you’re through it, you’ll understand how autoencoders stack up against traditional techniques and why they often capture the deeper patterns those older methods miss.\n\n## Fabric Platform, Administrative & Governance\n\n### Ricardo Rincón, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nexus150/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Fabric Data Days: Todo sobre los costos de Fabric ( y más de Fabric )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQy8Isl7JuM)\n\nThree-hour (Almost) video (record from live stream with Q&A from the audience) in Spanish that explains in detail the Fabric CUs (and disk) consumption model and the Capacity Metrics app in its entirety.\n\n### Srisakthi Kannan, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakthee/)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog: [Lakehouse and Warehouse deployment using Azure Devops](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Fabric-platform-Community-Blog/Lakehouse-and-Warehouse-Deployment-with-Azure-DevOps-A-Practical/ba-p/4876100)\n\nLearn how to automate deployment of Lakehouse and Warehouse objects and schema using Azure Devops Pipeline.\n\n## Real-Time Intelligence\n\n### Inturi Suparna Babu, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inturi-suparna-babu-312b59270/)\n\nAffiliation: Super User\n\nBlog: [Building a Real-Time Weather Dashboard in Microsoft Fabric: Step-by-Step Guide](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Real-Time-Intelligence-Community/Building-a-Real-Time-Weather-Dashboard-in-Microsoft-Fabric-Step/ba-p/4897230)\n\nIn this blog, I’ll walk you through how to build a Real-Time Weather Analytics Dashboard in Microsoft Fabric by streaming public weather feeds into Eventstream, storing them in Eventhouse, and finally visualizing them in a Real-Time Dashboard.\n\n## Databases\n\n### Kevin Chant, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-chant/)\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Two ways to perform CI/CD for SQL database in Fabric using Azure DevOps I Data Exposed: MVP Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJzNNR8nFlI)\n\n## Learning & Certification\n\n### Gaston Cruz and Alex Rostan\n\nAffiliation: MVP\n\nYouTube: [Updates from Microsoft Ignite 2025](https://youtu.be/vERYvSJeIVs?si=ykKdzX7V5MKd1u1J)\n\nGet ready for the biggest announcements from Microsoft Ignite 2025 in San Francisco! In this video, I break down everything you need to know about the latest updates across Power Platform, Copilot Studio, Fabric, Azure, and the next wave of AI innovation shaping the future of business applications.\n\n## Thank you for a great year!
