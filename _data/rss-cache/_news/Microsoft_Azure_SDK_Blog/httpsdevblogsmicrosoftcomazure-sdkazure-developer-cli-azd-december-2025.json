  "Description": "This post announces the December release of the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`).\n\nThe post [Azure Developer CLI (azd) Dec 2025 – Extensions Enhancements, Foundry Rebranding, and Azure Pipelines Improvements](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azure-developer-cli-azd-december-2025/) appeared first on [Azure SDK Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk).",
  "EnhancedContent": "Welcome to the December 2025 edition of the Azure Developer CLI (`azd` ) release blog—our final release of the year! This post covers releases 1.22.0 through 1.22.5, wrapping up 2025. To share your feedback and questions, join the [December release discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/discussions/).\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n- Enhanced extension capabilities with custom configuration and interactive mode support\n- Improved provisioning progress display and error handling\n- Multiple bug fixes for Container Apps, Azure Pipelines, and deployment workflows\n- Better support for Terraform and Static Web Apps\n\n## New features\n\n### 🔌 Extension Framework Enhancements\n\nIf you’re new to azd extensions, they’re modular additions that extend azd functionality beyond built-in commands. Extensions are plugins that introduce new CLI commands, allowing you to tailor `azd` to specific needs and scenarios. With extensions, you can add new capabilities, automate repetitive tasks, and integrate Azure services or third-party tools directly from the CLI. For more details, check out our [introduction to the azd extension framework](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azd-extension-framework/).\n\n- **Custom configuration properties**: Extensions can now define custom configuration properties at both project and service levels, enabling more flexible and powerful extension behaviors. This change allows extension authors to add specialized configurations without modifying core `azd`\nschemas. [\\[#6196\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6196)\n- **Interactive mode support**: Extensions now support interactive mode, enabling TUI (Text User Interface) applications to provide richer user experiences. This change allows extensions to prompt users for input and display interactive interfaces when needed. [\\[#6367\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6367)\n- **Distributed tracing and structured error handling**: Extensions benefit from improved observability with distributed tracing support and structured error handling, making it easier to diagnose issues and track execution flows. [\\[#6321\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6321)\n\n### ✨ User Experience Improvements\n\n- **Interactive environment selector**: The `azd env select`\ncommand now provides an interactive selector when no environment is specified, making it easier to switch between environments without remembering exact names. [\\[#6347\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6347)\n- **Improved provisioning progress display**: Provisioning progress polling interval reduced from 10 seconds to 3 seconds, providing more responsive status updates during infrastructure deployment. [\\[#6256\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6256)\n- **Enhanced error handling**: Better error messages are now displayed when loading invalid `azure.yaml`\nfiles, replacing panics with clear, actionable error descriptions. [\\[#6373\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6373)\n- **Improved error handling flow**: Three-solution prompt added with upgraded langchain dependency for better error resolution guidance. [\\[#6313\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6313)\n\n### ⚙️ Azure Configuration\n\n- **azure.yml file support**: `azd`\nnow supports `azure.yml` as an alternative to `azure.yaml` for project configuration files, providing more flexibility in naming conventions. [\\[#6285\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6285)\n- **Template gallery integration**: Template gallery links are now integrated into `azd init`\nand `azd template list` commands, making it easier to discover and start from templates. [\\[#6300\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6300)\n- **Directory creation prompt**: Using `-C`\n/`--cwd` with a nonexistent path, `azd` now prompts to create the directory automatically. [\\[#6266\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6266)\n\n### 🎁 Other Enhancements\n\n- **Language-specific .gitignore templates**: Extension scaffolding with `azd x init`\nnow includes language-specific `.gitignore` templates for cleaner repositories. [\\[#6232\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6232)\n- **Microsoft Foundry name**: Updated naming from Azure AI Foundry to Microsoft Foundry throughout the codebase and documentation. [\\[#6270\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6270)\n\n## 🪲 Bugs fixed\n\n### Extension and Deployment Fixes\n\n- **Extension installation fix**: Fixed panic during provisioning caused by custom configuration properties feature introduced in v1.22.4, is temporarily reverted. [\\[#6408\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6408)\n- **Extension installation prompts**: Fixed `azd provision --preview`\nincorrectly prompting to install extensions for custom service targets when the extension is already installed. [\\[#6398\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6398)\n- **Resource discovery**: Improved resource discovery logic to correctly identify resources associated with deployments during deletion operations. [\\[#6356\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6356)\n- **Display names**: Fixed display names for Foundry and Foundry project resources in output. [\\[#6385\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6385)\n\n### Container Apps Improvements\n\n- **Container App deployment**: Fixed Container App deployment to correctly resolve infrastructure path from defaults when using layered provisioning with service module settings. [\\[#6360\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6360)\n- **Container App revision deployment**: Fixed Container App revision deployment to respect service `module`\nsetting in `azure.yaml` . [\\[#6346\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6346)\n- **Revision mode error messages**: Fixed unclear error message when deploying to improperly tagged Container App in nonrevision mode. [\\[#6353\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6353)\n\n### Azure Pipelines and Deployment\n\n- **GitHub URL parsing**: Fixed GitHub URL parsing to support branch names containing slashes. [\\[#6351\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6351)\n- **Static Web App deployment**: Fixed Static Web App deployment by ensuring framework service requires restore and produces correct artifacts. [\\[#6341\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6341)\n- **azd down deletion**: Improved `azd down`\ndeletion behavior for resource-group-scoped deployments. [\\[#6345\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6345)\n- **Hooks in CI/CD**: Fixed hooks not running in CI/CD scenarios when `.azure`\ndirectory doesn’t exist. [\\[#6277\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6277)\n- **ARM nil field handling**: Fixed panic in `azd provision --preview`\nwhen ARM returns nil After field during resource deletion. [\\[#6282\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6282)\n- **Deployment skipping**: Fixed `azd provision`\nskipping deployment when resource groups were deleted outside of azd. [\\[#6281\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/6281)\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n- **JSON-escaped variables**: Fixed JSON-escaped environment variables being lost when syncing to remote CI/CD pipelines. Thanks @Menghua1 for the contribution! [\\[#5568\\]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/pull/5568)\n\n### Aspire Improvements\n\n- **Non-HTTP protocols**: Relaxed Aspire binding validation for non-HTTP protocols as simple TCP.
