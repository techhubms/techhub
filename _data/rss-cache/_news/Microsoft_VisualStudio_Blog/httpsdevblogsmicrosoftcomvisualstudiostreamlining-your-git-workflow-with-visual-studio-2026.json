  "EnhancedContent": "You’re a .NET developer with a busy morning, and an Azure DevOps ticket drops: “Login endpoint 500s under load.” You’ve got to fix it, review a teammate’s feature branch, and keep your repo clean – all before lunch. Visual Studio’s Git tools turn this everyday Git workflow of creating topic branches, stashing changes, committing, and handling PRs into a smooth, fast process.\n\nLet’s walk through your morning, showing how Visual Studio keeps Git friction out of your way.\n\n## 9:00 AM: Spin up a topic branch for your bug fix\n\nYour repo’s open in VS (View → Git Repository), and you’re on main, fresh from last night’s CI run. To keep your bug-fix isolated, you right-click main in the **Git Repository Window**, select **New Local Branch From**, and name it *fix/auth-race-1*, linking it to your DevOps ticket. You’re switched to the new branch instantly, and the 2026 Git status bar shows your branch and sync status, so you’re never lost.\n\n[![New Local Branch From](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAfMAAAF3AQMAAACL4DDGAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAALUlEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdP7ewBFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN13AAAEEKjBBAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Picture1.webp)\n\nYou update *AuthService.cs* with an async lock to fix the race condition.\n\nA Slack ping from the PM interrupts: they need you to review a feature branch for a demo. Time to pause your work without losing it.\n\n## 9:30 AM: Stash changes to juggle tasks\n\nYou’re mid-fix with unsaved changes, not ready to commit. In the **Git Changes Window** (View → Git Changes), you select your modified files, click **Stash All**, and add a note: “WIP: Auth fix before demo.” Visual Studio shelves everything, leaving your directory clean.\n\n[![Picture2 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAbUAAAHJAQMAAAA4hDUkAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAMElEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQZ/oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDXAGP4AAHH5ps/AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Picture2.webp)\n\nBranch switching in Visual Studio is a lot faster now thanks to optimized solution load and indexing. You polish the feature and push it to remote, all while your bug fix stays safely stashed.\n\nWith the feature review done, you’re ready to return to your bug fix and polish it before committing.\n\n## 10:15 AM: Pop stash and review code\n\nYou switch back to *fix/auth-race-1*, and Visual Studio’s fast branch switching keeps you moving. To restore your work, go to **Git Changes Window**, hit the **Stash** tab, right-click, and select **Pop Stash**. Your changes come back seamlessly.\n\nBefore committing, you want to catch any slip-ups. In **Git Changes Window**, click the **Copilot Code Review** button. Copilot scans your diff and leaves a few comments in the editor. You apply the suggestions with one click.\n\n[![Picture3 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABZYAAAHfAQMAAAD5uB/zAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAaklEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQZ/oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4DNQ2wABqiUXfAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Picture3.webp)\n\nFor extra confidence, open **Copilot Chat** (View → Copilot Chat), type “#changes Check security,” and get: “Add rate limiting for brute-force protection.” You tweak the code, catching more issues early, which makes your eventual PR cleaner.\n\nWith your code polished, you’re ready to commit your changes.\n\n## 10:45 AM: Time to commit\n\nYour code’s solid, so it’s time to commit. In the **Git Changes Window**, click the **Generate Commit Message** button. It’s formatted to your team’s standard (learn how to set that up in [an earlier blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/customize-your-ai-generated-git-commit-messages/)), tied to DevOps, and saves you a minute. Push your changes with a click, keeping your history clean and team friendly.\n\n[![Picture4 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAcAAAAJwAQMAAAAkySPYAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAOUlEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADPBorwAAE+8VBkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Picture4.webp)\n\nNow it’s time to share this with your team.\n\n## 11:15 AM: Create PR and review inline\n\nYour work is now ready for a review! Upon pushing, you get a banner in the Git Changes window and click the link to create a pull request. (Alternatively, you can also go to **Git Repository Window** and right-click fix/auth-race-1 → **Create Pull Request**.**)** In the PR creation UI, select your lead, Sarah, and another teammate, Mike, as reviewers by clicking the **Add Reviewers** field and choosing their names from the dropdown. Since there’s just one commit, VS automatically pulls Copilot’s commit message into the Azure DevOps PR description. You could also generate a PR description to ensure it matches your team’s standards. Click Create, and it’s up for review.\n\n[![Picture5 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABZYAAAMUAQMAAAAVCOCtAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAoElEQVR4nO3BAQ0AAADCoPdPbQ8HFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADwYqLgAB9/KGPAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Picture5.webp)\n\nSarah can easily review the PR right in Visual Studio, finding it assigned to her in the **Git Repository Window**.\n\n[![Picture6 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAfIAAAIWAQMAAACWYp2aAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAOElEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD4GhYAAAdPmceUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Picture6.webp)\n\nShe opens the PR and adds comments directly inside Visual Studio. The Markdown renders right in the diff, threaded and clear. No browser tabs needed!\n\n[![Picture7 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABZYAAAMwAQMAAACJNaeNAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAApUlEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQlPoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB4Gj3eAAE6ncaSAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Picture7.webp)\n\nYou reply inline, make updates, and push your new changes. Visual Studio syncs the diff instantly. Reviews feel less cluttered, and Sarah and Mike approve. You merge to main and delete the branch to keep the repo clean.\n\n## Wrap-up: Git that flows\n\nVisual Studio’s Git tools – fast branch switches, visual diffs, Copilot commits, AI reviews, inline comments – save you time in your daily grind. Branching, stashing, and PRs are smoother than ever before, letting you focus on code. The AI review before committing catches mistakes early, setting your PRs up for success.\n\nTry it out and let us know what other Git topics you want to know more about in the comments below.\n\nHappy coding!",
