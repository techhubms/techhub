  "EnhancedContent": "Across industries, organizations are moving from experimenting with single agents to running AI at the center of their business operations. While single agents excel at focused tasks, customers quickly discover that real enterprise work stretches across multiple steps, involves different roles, and requires strong governance. To operationalize AI in this environment, teams need a dependable way to coordinate agents, tools, and logic into complete, end-to-end processes.\n\nOver the past year, as customers deployed agents into production, the same challenges surfaced across industries:\n\n- Business processes rarely fit in a single prompt and often require multi-step coordination\n- Teams need safe, governed ways to connect multiple agents, tools, and data sources\n- Enterprises require visibility, versioning, and auditable execution\n- Developers want code-level control while business users want a visual design experience\n- Organizations need reliable, predictable outcomes with clear handoffs\n\nAt Microsoft Ignite, we are excited to announce the public preview of **multi-agent workflows in Foundry Agent Service**, a new capability built on the **[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) that brings** visual and YAML-based orchestration into the agent lifecycle. Workflows make it possible to design, automate, and monitor complex, multi-step processes with confidence and control.\n\nWorkflows are available now in both the **Foundry portal** and the **VS Code extension**. The visual designer lets teams drag, connect, and configure agents, tools, and data flows to model processes such as onboarding, financial approvals, or IT service operations. For developers who prefer code, the YAML definition provides precision, versioning, and seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines.\n\nBy combining specialized agents with a flexible orchestration layer, workflows transform multi-step operations into reliable, reusable, and secure automation patterns that scale across teams and functions. This represents the next chapter in building an agentic operating system for the enterprise.\n\n## A Complete Toolbox for Building Workflows\n\nWorkflows delivers a feature-rich toolset to design, automate, and observe multi-agent processes:\n\n1. **Visual workflow builder:** Use a drag-and-drop canvas to design multi-step flows using nodes and edges, without writing orchestration code. Create new agents directly from the canvas or reuse existing agents from your Foundry project. Perfect for business users, operations teams, analysts, and solution accelerators. [![visual workflow builder image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJfAQMAAADb2zbYAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAY0lEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAICzATHuAAGpFnKpAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/visual-workflow-builder.webp)\n2. **YAML Workflow definition:** Switch between Visual and YAML views. Any change in one view updates the other, helping business and engineering teams collaborate without context loss. [![YAML workflow definition image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAADdAQMAAAA7Ct0+AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAH0lEQVRoge3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQsvoAAAAAAAAAAAOBkhqwABJLDonwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/YAML-workflow-definition-1.webp)\n3. **Orchestration templates:** Start with patterns inspired by Microsoft Agent Framework workflows: **Sequential, Human-in-the-loop, Group chat.** Perfect for trying our workflows for the first time and accelerating a variety of use cases like approvals, case management, or multi-stage analysis.\n4. **Variables and JSON schema output:** Capture agent output as local variables, reference them in later steps, and use structured JSON schemas to enforce consistent output.\n5. **Power Fx expressions:** Use familiar, Excel-like formulas to drive conditions, transformations, or computed values inside your workflow. Learn more in this [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-power-fx).\n6. **Versioning and notes:** Every save creates an immutable version. Add notes on the canvas to explain workflow intent or design choices.\n\n[![Screenshot 2025 11 24 171028 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAACmAQMAAABa7yA8AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAHUlEQVRYhe3BgQAAAADDoPlTX+AIVQEAAAAAAPANGUoAAS1As0sAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-24-171028.webp)[![Screenshot 2025 11 24 170348 image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAAACEAQMAAAAQi4QBAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAG0lEQVRYhe3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAACPBhQcAAEWuCDGAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-24-170348.webp)\n\n##\n\n## Strengthening Workflow Reliability with End-to-End Observability\n\nAs workflows take on critical business operations, teams need clear visibility into how each step behaves. Foundry Agent Service provides a comprehensive observability stack workflow creators, operators, and reviewers that shows exactly what happened in a workflow run, how agents made decisions, and where improvements may be needed. Teams can trace every action, inspect agent outputs, follow variable updates, and validate behavior against governance requirements.\n\n- **Granular tracing:** Follow your workflow step by step, including every agent call, input, output, variable assignment, and branch path taken.\n- **Built-in evaluators:** Measure the quality, correctness, and safety of workflow execution using out-of-the-box evaluators.\n- **Custom evaluation logic:** Build custom evaluators to assess accuracy, compliance checks, domain-specific metrics, or operational behaviors unique to your organization.\n- **Automated monitoring:** Schedule evaluations or run them automatically to track workflow performance over time and ensure consistent quality.\n- **Operational insights:** Monitor key stats such as throughput, agent activity, error rates and identify the largest increases or decreases across runs.\n- **Post-deployment governance:** Detect drifts in agent behavior, quality, or safety as workloads evolve or as input data changes.\n\nWhile the first release focuses on observability for individual [Microsoft Foundry agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/migrate?view=foundry) running inside a workflow, teams can already evaluate the complete end-to-end experience by inspecting traces and metrics across every node in the flow.\n\n[![workflows conversation tracing image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAI9AQMAAACe55iJAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAXklEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4GwgzAABvmHdrAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/workflows_conversation_tracing.webp)\n\n[![worklfows agent monitor image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABZYAAAKyAQMAAAB8OhnqAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAj0lEQVR4nO3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQsvoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHgY5TcAAWQoumwAAAAASUVORK5CYII=)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/worklfows_agent_monitor.webp)\n\n## Build, Customize and Deploy Workflows Seamlessly in Visual Studio Code\n\nThe Ignite 2025 update to the **AI Toolkit extension pack for VS Code** gives developers a complete environment for building, debugging, and deploying multi-agent workflows. Teams can now work locally in VS Code, switch to the Foundry portal for visual orchestration, and deploy to Foundry with a single click.
