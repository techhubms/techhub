  "EnhancedContent": "At Microsoft Ignite this year, we’re excited to announce that Azure Content Understanding in Foundry Tools is now generally available (GA). Over the past months, we’ve seen preview usage across industries, from large consultancies to healthcare leaders, with invaluable customer feedback shaping this release.\n\nWith this GA release, we’re enabling flexibility and control with model choice, production-grade reliability, expanded region availability, and broader scenario coverage. In addition, this update brings tight integration with Microsoft Foundry Models, Foundry IQ powered by Azure AI Search, and agent ecosystems—making it easier than ever to build intelligent solutions.\n\nLet’s walk through what’s new.\n\n## Content Understanding now connects directly to Foundry Models\n\nOne of the biggest requests we heard during preview: *“Can I bring my own Gen AI model deployment?”*\n\nNow you can.\n\nYou can now connect Content Understanding to any supported **Microsoft Foundry model** deployment:\n\n- Make the quality and latency trade-offs based on the demands of your use case.\n- Save cost and consolidate usage by using **pay-as-you-go** or **Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs)** and leveraging global or data zone deployments.\n\n[![Figure 1 Content Understanding Framework image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJAAQMAAAApW4aWAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAXklEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7wYiTwAB/qbe0QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/Figure-1-Content-Understanding-Framework-2.webp)\n\nFigure 1: Content Understanding now extends to support Foundry model deployments, for enabling generative AI capabilities.\n\nContent Understanding pairs **specialized models** and **generative AI** where each excels: specialized models handle OCR, Layout, Transcription and produce confidence scores, while GenAI powers field extraction, segmentation, and figure analysis. The result is high quality output with predictable cost control and clear architecture.\n\nWe’re also expanding availability to [12 regions worldwide,](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/language-region-support) improving data residency options and lowering latency for global workloads. To learn more about supported regions, click [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/language-region-support).\n\n## Faster time-to-value with prebuilt analyzers\n\nAlongside the existing ability to create custom analyzers, we now provide a library of prebuilt analyzers optimized for top use cases like RAG ingestion, finance, procurement, and more. These capabilities have been some of the most popular in Azure Document Intelligence and we’re now extending them with foundation models in Content Understanding.\n\n## Purpose-built analyzers for RAG\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions succeed when responses are contextual, accurate, and relevant. Achieving that requires transforming unstructured content into structured knowledge. With GA, Content Understanding introduces RAG-specific analyzers designed to extract tables, paragraphs, and sections—and now, to analyze figures as well. This richer structure improves grounding, so your RAG solutions deliver answers that truly reflect the source content.\n\n### Layout-aware enrichment across documents\n\nContent Understanding now adds the ability to:\n\n- Extract **tables across pages** into a single markdown or JSON structure\n- Parse figures and converts **charts/diagrams** into structured representations (Chart.js, Mermaid.js)\n- Generate layout-aware markdown with headers, sections, and annotations represented to dramatically improve chunking and retrieval quality\n\nThis level of structural fidelity translates to context-dense chunks which results in more accurate responses.\n\n[![Figure 2 Content Understanding prebuilt analyzer ](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAAAyAQMAAACQ++z9AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAD0lEQVQokWNgGAWjYGgCAAK8AAGBAoNpAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/Figure-2-Content-Understanding-prebuilt-analyzer.svg)\n\nFigure 2: Figure analysis provides both description and structure mermaid code for diagrams providing much better grounding for downstream generations.\n\n[![Figure 2 Content Understanding prebuilt analyzer 2](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAAAyAQMAAACQ++z9AAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAD0lEQVQokWNgGAWjYGgCAAK8AAGBAoNpAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/Figure-3-Content-Understanding-prebuilt-analyzer-2.svg)\n\nFigure 3: Figure analysis provides both description and structure ChartJS or Mermaid code for diagrams providing much better grounding for downstream generations.\n\n### A full catalog of prebuilt RAG analyzers\n\nIn addition to documents, we are also making prebuilt analyzers for **video, audio and images** giving you RAG-ready outputs with no custom training.\n\nFor details on prebuilt analyzers, check out [Azure Content Understanding in Foundry Tools prebuilt analyzers – Foundry Tools | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/concepts/prebuilt-analyzers#retrieval-augmented-generation-rag-analyzers).\n\nHigh-quality extraction paired with built-in enrichment creates richer, structured representations of your content. This means downstream models don’t just see raw text. They receive contextually organized data that includes summaries, segmentation, and custom schemas.\n\n**With this foundation, models can reason more effectively, improving accuracy and relevance in tasks like question answering, summarization, and retrieval.** In short, better data representations lead to better intelligence.\n\n## Domain-specific analyzers\n\nOur new domain-specific prebuilt analyzers accelerate intelligent document processing (IDP) pipelines in **Finance** (statements, tax forms, W-2s, 1099s), **Contracts & procurement** (Contracts, Invoice, PO, etc.), **Mortgage & lending**, **Identity verification**, and more.\n\nThese analyzers provide specialized field extraction for specific document types and formats, powered by rich knowledge bases of real-world examples.\n\nFor the full list of supported analyzers and details on how to try them out see [Azure Content Understanding in Foundry Tools prebuilt analyzers – Foundry Tools | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/concepts/prebuilt-analyzers).\n\n## Now integrated into Foundry IQ and Azure AI Search\n\nThese latest capabilities like layout-aware enrichment with diagram and chart descriptions are now available across both Azure AI Search and [Foundry IQ](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-iq-unlocking-ubiquitous-knowledge-for-agents/4470812). This means that whether you’re building agentic workflows or enterprise search experiences, you can leverage Content Understanding for ingestion to deliver richer, more relevant context for every query. With seamless integration, developers no longer need to build custom pipelines or manage complex ingestion steps.\n\nThis gives search applications richer, more relevant embeddings and metadata for every file—no extra pipelines required.\n\nSee [Azure Content Understanding skill – Azure AI Search | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-content-understanding) for more details.\n\n## Agents can now use Content Understanding as a tool\n\nAgents need to understand files to act intelligently. Whether it’s a customer application, a receipt, or a contract, the details are critical. Content Understanding now provides:\n\n- A standardized representation for any supported file\n- A consistent schema across modalities\n- Prebuilt analyzers for many domain-specific file extraction tasks\n\nComing soon: a Content Understanding MCP server, enabling integration into multi-agent systems and tool ecosystems.\n\n## Upgrades for document processing\n\nIf you’ve been using Content Understanding during preview or migrating from Document Intelligence, this GA release delivers a host of updates designed to enhance usability and streamline your workflows.\n\n**Splitting and classification for complex documents**\n\nNow, complex documents can be automatically segmented into their constituent pieces. For example, separating a visa application into the application form, marriage license, and proof of residency.\n\nEach segment is then routed to a purpose-built analyzer, ensuring that every piece extracts the right structured representation for downstream systems to process. In the visa example, the marriage certificate can leverage a pre-built analyzer, while the application can route to an analyzer custom built for this application.\n\n[![Figure 4 Content Understanding document segmentation and routing image](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABAAAAAJAAQMAAAApW4aWAAAAA1BMVEXW1taWrGEgAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAXklEQVR4nO3BAQEAAACCIP+vbkhAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA7wYiTwAB/qbe0QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2025/11/Figure-4-Content-Understanding-document-segmentation-and-routing-2.webp)\n\nFigure 4: New splitting and classification capabilities enable the creation of complex workflows by breaking documents into smaller sections and analyzing each with purpose-built analyzers.\n\nThis new capability unlocks powerful scenarios in finance, government, healthcare, and beyond—where documents are rarely one-size-fits-all, and precision matters at every step.\n\n**Granular control to reduce cost and complexity**\n\nWe’ve added support for grounding and confidence scores to more scenarios, added more granular control and more complex schemas to improve flexibility and reduce cost. These updates also help lower operational costs and latency by optimizing extraction workflows and enabling faster, more efficient processing. Key enhancements include:\n\n- Confidence scores and grounding across *all* document extraction methods\n- Per-field controls for when confidence and grounding are applied\n- Automatic selection of extraction method, so customers don’t need to explicitly select between extract or generate for each field.\n- Support for complex object types within schemas\n- Additional control of content extraction method used (read or layout) and the generative AI model types, now including mini and nano models.\n\nAs a result: **lower** **cost, lower latency,** and the right structured outputs to enable straight-through-processing**.**\n\n**A clear path forward**\n\nWith GA, we now recommend **Content Understanding as the starting point** for new file-processing workloads and related agentic applications. It carries forward the power of Document Intelligence while adding field extraction powered by foundation models, multimodal capabilities, RAG optimization, and integration of analyzers within Microsoft Foundry.\n\n## Customer momentum: Leading brands deriving value with Content Understanding\n\nCustomers across industries are already building high-scale production workloads with Content Understanding.\n\n**KPMG: Bringing clarity to complex audits with Azure Content Understanding**\n\nKPMG Clara AI is redefining audit intelligence by tackling the surge of unstructured data in modern audits.
