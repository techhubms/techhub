        <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured framework that guides teams through creating high-quality software efficiently. Each phase builds upon the previous, with clear handovers ensuring smooth transitions. AI enhances every phase—from rapid prototyping to predicting system failures—transforming how every team member works, not just developers.</p>

                        <p>AI transforms ideation from a purely creative exercise into a data-informed discovery process.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For developers</strong>, AI generates functional prototypes from natural language descriptions using tools like GitHub Spark, which creates full-stack micro apps from simple prompts. AI creates UI mockups instantly, suggests feature combinations based on technical feasibility, and explores design alternatives at unprecedented speed—all without writing deployment code.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For Product Owners</strong>, AI analyzes market trends using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to surface emerging opportunities, competitive gaps, and user pain points from vast data sources. AI serves as a brainstorming partner, helping refine rough ideas into structured feature proposals with potential unique selling points.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For Scrum Masters</strong>, AI helps document ideation sessions, synthesize diverse stakeholder inputs into coherent themes, and identify dependencies or risks in proposed concepts early.</p>

                        <p>AI revolutionizes requirements gathering by transforming how teams capture, structure, and validate what they need to build.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For developers</strong>, AI analyzes requirement documents to identify ambiguities, contradictions, and missing edge cases before implementation begins. AI generates technical specifications from business requirements and suggests acceptance criteria based on similar projects.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For Product Owners</strong>, AI is a game-changer: it transforms raw stakeholder inputs—meeting notes, emails, feedback—into structured requirements documents. AI generates comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria, creates Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), and helps prioritize backlogs based on business value and dependencies. Tools like GitHub Spark enable instant creation of interactive prototypes from requirements, making stakeholder validation tangible instead of abstract.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For Scrum Masters</strong>, AI assists in breaking epics into sprint-sized user stories, estimates story points based on historical data, identifies potential blockers, and ensures requirements are clear enough for the team to estimate and commit to.</p>

                        <p>AI accelerates the translation of requirements into technical blueprints.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For developers and architects</strong>, AI generates architecture diagrams from requirements, suggests optimal design patterns based on scalability needs, creates database schemas, and produces code scaffolding from specifications. AI identifies potential security vulnerabilities and scalability concerns during design review, before any code is written. It can also generate API contracts and interface definitions. GitHub Spark can create working interactive prototypes to validate UX flows before committing to full implementation. Tools like Figma's MCP server bridge the design-to-code gap by providing AI coding assistants with direct access to design context—pattern metadata, variable definitions, screenshots, and interactivity information—enabling design-informed code generation that respects your design system.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For Product Owners</strong>, AI creates visual representations of user journeys and system flows, making technical designs accessible for review and validation against business needs.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For Scrum Masters</strong>, AI helps estimate design complexity, identifies technical debt risks in proposed architectures, and ensures design decisions are documented for team reference.</p>

                        <p><strong>For developers</strong>, AI provides real-time code suggestions and intelligent autocompletion, generates boilerplate code and repetitive patterns, assists with debugging by explaining errors and suggesting fixes, translates code between languages, and helps refactor for better performance and maintainability.

                        <p>AI dramatically expands test coverage while reducing manual effort.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>For developers and QA engineers</strong>, AI auto-generates unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end test cases directly from code and requirements. AI identifies high-risk areas that need focused testing, suggests edge cases that humans often miss, and predicts where bugs are most likely to occur based on code complexity and change frequency. AI analyzes patterns in bug reports to prevent similar issues and continuously improves test coverage recommendations. Through MCP servers like Playwright MCP, AI can directly automate browser testing—navigating pages, capturing screenshots, filling forms, and validating UI behavior—enabling AI-driven end-to-end test generation and execution.</p>

                        <p><strong>For DevOps engineers and developers</strong>, AI predicts optimal deployment timing based on historical success rates, system load, and team availability. During rollouts, AI monitors real-time health metrics and automatically detects anomalies that might indicate problems. AI suggests rollback triggers before issues escalate and can even automate rollback decisions based on predefined thresholds. Through MCP servers like Terraform MCP, AI can directly interact with Infrastructure as Code—generating, validating, and managing Terraform configurations for seamless cloud resource provisioning. AI helps ensure infrastructure changes are consistent, well-documented, and follow best practices.</p>

            <p>Define functional and technical requirements with precision and completeness. AI performs best when it understands exactly what you're trying to achieve.</p>
            <h4>What to do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Write detailed user stories with specific acceptance criteria</li>
                <li>Document constraints, edge cases, and non-functional requirements</li>

                <li>Define what success looks like before starting</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example:</h4>

            <h4>What to do:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use advanced models (GPT-4, Claude) for complex reasoning and architecture</li>
                <li>Use faster models for simple completions and refactoring</li>
                <li>Consider specialized models for specific domains (security, testing)</li>
                <li>Evaluate cost vs. quality tradeoffs for high-volume tasks</li>
                <li>Test different models and track which perform best for your use cases</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Use GPT-4 for generating complex business logic and architectural decisions, but use a faster model like GPT-3.5 for generating boilerplate code, documentation, or simple unit tests.</p>
