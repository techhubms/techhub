## ML vs AI vs GenAI

Understanding the relationship between these three concepts is essential for anyone starting their AI journey.

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a method of data analysis where computers learn to identify patterns in data without being explicitly programmed for each task. Think of it as teaching a computer to recognize cats in photos by showing it thousands of cat pictures, rather than writing specific code that says "a cat has pointed ears, whiskers, and four legs."

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a broader field that includes machine learning but also encompasses other approaches to creating intelligent systems. AI aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, planning, and understanding language.

Machine learning is one approach within the AI toolkit, but AI also includes:

- **Rule-based systems**: Follow pre-defined logical rules and conditions (like "if temperature > 80Â°F, then turn on air conditioning")
- **Expert systems**: Capture human expertise in specific domains through knowledge bases and inference engines (like medical diagnosis systems that apply doctor's knowledge)
- **Symbolic AI**: Uses symbols and logic to represent knowledge and reasoning (like early chess programs that evaluated board positions)
- **Evolutionary algorithms**: Solve problems by mimicking natural selection and evolution
- **Fuzzy logic**: Handles uncertainty and partial truths rather than strict true/false logic

These different approaches can be combined or used independently depending on the problem being solved.

**Generative AI (GenAI)** is a specific type of AI that can create new content - text, images, code, music, or other types of data. When you ask ChatGPT to write a story or use DALL-E to create an image, you're using generative AI. GenAI models learn patterns from existing content and use that knowledge to generate new, original content that follows similar patterns.

## GenAI part 1

### Introduction

Understanding Generative AI begins with **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, the foundational branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP represents a major breakthrough in human-computer interaction - instead of requiring users to learn programming languages or use specific commands, it allows people to interact with computers using natural human language, speaking or typing as they would to another person.

Within the broad field of NLP, modern AI systems primarily rely on language models - sophisticated AI systems that learn from vast amounts of text to understand and generate human-like responses. These language models come in different sizes and capabilities, each designed for specific use cases and computational requirements.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** represent the current pinnacle of NLP technology. These AI systems are trained on enormous datasets containing billions of text examples from books, articles, websites, and other written sources. Through this training, they learn intricate patterns in how humans use language and develop the ability to generate remarkably human-like text responses. Popular examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini. LLMs typically contain billions of parameters (the internal "settings" the AI adjusts during learning) and require significant computational resources to operate effectively.

**Small Language Models (SLMs)** serve the same fundamental purpose as their larger counterparts but prioritize efficiency and accessibility. These models are trained on more focused datasets and contain fewer parameters, making them suitable for running on local devices like smartphones, laptops, or edge computing environments. Examples include Microsoft's Phi models and various specialized versions optimized for specific tasks or industries.

Beyond text-focused language models, the NLP field has expanded to encompass various specialized model types that work with different forms of content:

- **Diffusion models** (such as DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney) generate images from text descriptions
- **Speech recognition models** (like Whisper) convert spoken words into written text
- **Music generation models** (such as AIVA) create original musical compositions
- **Multimodal models** (like GPT-4o) can work seamlessly with multiple types of input and output - text, images, audio, and video

This diversity of model types reflects the broader evolution of AI from simple text processing to comprehensive understanding and generation across multiple forms of human communication and creative expression.

### Vendors

AI vendors are companies that develop, train, and provide access to AI models. Each vendor brings different strengths, approaches, and business models to the market.

**Major AI vendors include:**

- **OpenAI**: Creator of the GPT series and DALL-E, known for ChatGPT and pioneering conversational AI
- **Google**: Develops Gemini models and provides AI services through Google Cloud
- **Anthropic**: Focuses on AI safety and creates the Claude family of models
- **Microsoft**: Partners with OpenAI and develops its own models while integrating AI across its product suite
- **Hugging Face**: Acts as a platform for sharing and hosting AI models, both open-source and commercial

**What vendors do:**
Vendors serve as the bridge between the complex world of AI model development and practical applications. They handle the enormous costs and technical challenges of training models, then make these models available through user-friendly interfaces and APIs. This allows developers and businesses to use sophisticated AI without needing to understand the underlying mathematics or infrastructure.

**Key differences between vendors:**

- **Research focus**: Some prioritize cutting-edge capabilities, others emphasize safety and reliability
- **Business models**: Some offer free tiers with paid upgrades, others are enterprise-focused
- **Specializations**: Different vendors excel in text, images, code, or multimodal applications
- **Accessibility**: Some focus on easy-to-use consumer interfaces, others provide developer tools and APIs
- **Data policies**: Vendors differ in how they handle user data and model training

### Models

A **model** is the actual AI system that has been trained to perform specific tasks. Think of it as a specialized brain that has learned patterns from data and can apply that knowledge to new situations.

**Key characteristics that differentiate models:**

- **Training date**: When the model was trained affects what information it knows
- **Cut-off date**: The latest date of information the model was trained on
- **Size**: Larger models generally have more capabilities but require more computational resources
- **Vendor**: Different companies create models with different strengths and focuses
- **Specialization**: Some models excel at specific tasks like coding, creative writing, or analysis

**Current popular models include:**

**Large Language Models (LLMs):**

- **GPT series** (3.5, 4, 4o): OpenAI's flagship models for text generation and reasoning
- **Claude** (Sonnet, Opus): Anthropic's models focused on helpful, harmless, and honest interactions
- **Gemini** (Flash, Pro): Google's multimodal models that can process text, images, and other data
- **Grok**: X (formerly Twitter)'s conversational AI model

**Small Language Models (SLMs):**

- **Phi**: Microsoft's efficient models designed to run on smaller devices
- **Smol**: Compact models optimized for specific tasks

**Specialized Models:**

- **DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney**: Image generation models (diffusion models)
- **Whisper**: Speech-to-text conversion model
- **AIVA**: Music composition model
- **GPT-4o/4o mini**: Multimodal models that handle text, images, audio, and video

#### Models FAQ

**What is a GPT and why are not all models GPT?**
GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer." It's a specific architecture developed by OpenAI. Not all models use this architecture - companies develop different approaches to achieve similar goals. Think of it like cars: not all cars are Toyotas, even though they all serve the same basic purpose of transportation.

**What does multimodal mean and how can I use it?**
Multimodal models can understand and generate multiple types of content - not just text, but also images, audio, and video. For example, you can upload an image to GPT-4o and ask it to describe what it sees, or ask it to create an image based on your description. This makes interactions more natural and expands what you can accomplish with AI.

**Why not train a model every month or week to keep it up-to-date?**
Training large AI models requires enormous computational resources, costs millions of dollars, and takes weeks or months to complete. The process involves analyzing billions of text examples and adjusting trillions of parameters. Additionally, frequent retraining could make models less stable and reliable. Instead, vendors typically release new versions periodically with updated knowledge and improved capabilities.

### Providers

**Providers** are services that host AI models and make them accessible to users and developers. While vendors create the models, providers handle the infrastructure needed to run them at scale and make them available through APIs, web interfaces, or applications.

**Technical components of hosted AI services include:**

- **Proxy**: Routes requests to available model instances and manages traffic
- **Load balancer**: Distributes requests across multiple servers to ensure reliable performance
- **Content filter**: Screens inputs and outputs to prevent harmful or inappropriate content
- **Rate limiting**: Controls how many requests users can make to prevent abuse
- **Authentication**: Manages user access and API keys
- **Monitoring**: Tracks usage, performance, and costs

**Major hosted providers:**

- **OpenAI**: Direct access to GPT models through their API and ChatGPT interface
- **Google Cloud**: Hosts Gemini and other Google AI models
- **Microsoft Azure**:
  - **Azure OpenAI**: Enterprise-grade access to OpenAI models with enhanced security and compliance
  - **GitHub Models**: Developer-focused platform with model catalog and development tools
- **Hugging Face**: Platform for both open-source and commercial models
- **Anthropic**: Direct access to Claude models

**Self-hosting options:**

For organizations that need complete control over their AI infrastructure, self-hosting is possible:

- **Docker containers**: Run models in containerized environments
- **Ollama**: User-friendly tool for running models locally
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Library for deploying models on your own hardware

#### Providers FAQ

**Do all hosted solutions use my data?**
Data usage policies vary significantly between providers. Some use conversation data to improve their models (with user consent), while others, particularly enterprise-focused services, commit to not using customer data for training. Always check the specific terms of service and privacy policies.

**Where is my data stored?**
Data storage locations depend on the provider and service tier. Consumer services might store data globally, while enterprise services often allow you to specify geographic regions for compliance with local regulations like GDPR.

**Can I opt-out of data collection?**
Most providers offer ways to limit data collection, though the options vary. Some allow you to delete conversation history, others provide settings to prevent data from being used for model training.

**How does Azure OpenAI differ from using OpenAI directly?**
Azure OpenAI provides the same models as OpenAI but with enterprise-grade security, compliance certifications, integration with other Azure services, and guarantees that your data won't be used to train models. It's designed for organizations with strict data governance requirements.

**How does GitHub Models relate to GitHub Copilot?**
GitHub Models is a development platform that gives developers access to various AI models for building applications, while GitHub Copilot is a specific AI coding assistant. Think of GitHub Models as a toolbox for AI development, and Copilot as one specific tool that helps with coding. [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/about-github-models) provides model catalogs, prompt management, and evaluation tools for developers.

### Prompts & messages

**Prompts** are the instructions or questions you give to an AI model, while **messages** are the individual communications in a conversation between you and the AI. Understanding how to structure these effectively is key to getting good results from AI systems.

**Types of prompts and messages:**

- **User prompt**: Your question, instruction, or request to the AI
- **System prompt**: Background instructions that set the AI's behavior, role, or constraints (often hidden from users)
- **Assistant message**: The AI's response to your prompt
  - **Suggestions**: When the AI offers multiple options or approaches
  - **Completions**: When the AI finishes or continues text you've started

**Prompt engineering** is the practice of crafting effective prompts to get better results from AI models. Different techniques work better for different types of tasks:

**Prompt techniques:**

- **Zero-shot prompts**: Ask the AI to perform a task without providing examples
  - Example: "Summarize this article in three bullet points."
  
- **Few-shot prompts**: Provide a few examples of the desired input-output pattern
  - Example: "Translate these phrases. English: Hello â Spanish: Hola. English: Thank you â Spanish: Gracias. English: Good morning â Spanish: ?"
  
- **Chain of thought prompts**: Ask the AI to show its reasoning process
  - Example: "Solve this math problem step by step, showing your work."

**Reusable prompts** are templates or standardized instructions that you can use repeatedly for similar tasks. These save time and ensure consistency. For example, you might create a standard prompt for code reviews or document summaries that includes specific criteria and formatting instructions.

### Tokens & Tokenization

**Tokens** are the basic units that AI models use to process text. Think of them as the "words" that the AI actually understands, though they don't always match human words exactly.

**How tokenization works:**
When you send text to an AI model, it first breaks your message into tokens. This process, called tokenization, splits text into manageable pieces. A token might be:

- A whole word (like "hello")
- Part of a word (like "un" and "believable" for "unbelievable")
- A punctuation mark
- A space or special character

**How many tokens are in a message?**
As a rough guide, 1 token equals about 0.75 English words. So 100 words would be approximately 133 tokens. However, this varies based on:

- Language (non-English text often uses more tokens)
- Technical terms and proper nouns
- Punctuation and formatting

**Why is this important?**
Tokens directly affect:

- **Cost**: Most AI services charge per token processed
- **Speed**: More tokens mean longer processing time
- **Limits**: Models have maximum token limits for conversations

**Token limits and what happens when you exceed them:**
Every model has a maximum context window (total tokens it can process at once). When you exceed this limit:

- The model might truncate older parts of the conversation
- You might get an error message
- The quality of responses may decrease

**What to do when hitting token limits:**

- Summarize earlier parts of long conversations
- Break complex tasks into smaller pieces
- Use more concise language in your prompts
- Start a new conversation if context becomes too long

**Switching between tokenizers:**
Different models use different tokenization methods, so you can't directly transfer token counts between models. What takes 100 tokens in one model might take 90 or 110 in another.

**Tokenization differences between content types:**

- **Text**: Broken into word parts and punctuation
- **Images**: Converted into fixed-size "image tokens" representing visual information
- **Audio**: Processed into time-based segments representing sound patterns
- **Code**: Often tokenized similar to text but may handle syntax differently

### Costs

Understanding AI costs helps you make informed decisions about which models and approaches to use for different tasks.

**Cost factors:**

**Context**: The amount of information the model needs to consider affects cost. This includes your current message plus any conversation history or background information (system prompts).

**Chat history**: Longer conversations cost more because the model processes the entire conversation context with each new message. If you have a 50-message conversation, the model reviews all previous messages to understand context when responding to message 51.

**Prompts**: More detailed and longer prompts cost more to process, but they often produce better results. Finding the right balance between prompt detail and cost is important for regular use.

**Cost optimization strategies:**

- Keep conversations focused and avoid unnecessary context
- Use smaller, more efficient models for simple tasks
- Reserve powerful (expensive) models for complex problems
- Consider using summarization to reduce context length in long conversations
- Clear conversation history when starting new topics that don't require previous context

### Problems with models

Understanding the limitations of AI models helps you use them more effectively and avoid common pitfalls.

**Hallucinations**
AI models sometimes generate information that sounds confident and plausible but is factually incorrect. This happens because models predict what text should come next based on patterns they learned, rather than accessing a database of facts. Always verify important information, especially dates, statistics, and specific claims.

**Input-poisoning**
Malicious users might try to manipulate AI responses by including hidden instructions or misleading information in their prompts. Well-designed systems include protections against this, but it's important to be aware that AI responses can be influenced by how questions are framed.

**Jailbreaking**
This refers to attempts to bypass an AI's safety guidelines or restrictions through clever prompting techniques. While providers work to prevent this, it highlights the importance of not relying solely on AI systems for content moderation or safety-critical decisions.

**Why AI struggles with calculations and counting**
Language models are designed to predict text patterns, not perform precise mathematical operations. They might correctly handle simple arithmetic they've seen many times in training data, but they're not calculators. For reliable mathematical results:

- Use dedicated calculation tools
- Ask the AI to write code that performs the calculation
- Verify mathematical results independently

When you need precise calculations or counting, consider using AI to generate code for a calculator or spreadsheet rather than asking for direct numerical results.

**Human-in-the-loop (HITL) approaches**
Given these limitations, many organizations implement Human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems where humans remain involved in AI decision-making processes. Instead of fully automated AI systems, HITL approaches include human oversight, validation, or intervention at key points. For example, an AI might flag potentially problematic content, but a human reviews and makes the final decision about whether to remove it. This approach helps mitigate risks while still benefiting from AI's efficiency and capabilities.

### Fine-tuning a model

Fine-tuning involves adjusting model behavior and output to better match your specific needs. While full model retraining requires significant resources, you can influence model behavior through several techniques:

**Grounding**
Grounding provides the AI with specific, factual information to base its responses on. Instead of relying on the model's training data, you supply current, accurate information within your prompt. For example, when asking about company policies, include the actual policy text in your prompt rather than assuming the model knows current details.

**Temperature**
Temperature controls how creative or predictable the AI's responses are:

- **Low temperature (0.0-0.3)**: More focused and consistent responses, good for factual tasks
- **Medium temperature (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and consistency, suitable for most general tasks
- **High temperature (0.8-1.0)**: More creative and varied responses, useful for brainstorming or creative writing

**Top P (nucleus sampling)**
Top P determines how many alternative words the model considers when generating each token:

- **Low Top P (0.1-0.5)**: More focused responses using only the most likely word choices
- **High Top P (0.8-1.0)**: More diverse responses considering a wider range of possible words

These settings work together - you might use low temperature and low Top P for consistent, factual responses, or high temperature and high Top P for creative brainstorming sessions.

### Advanced concepts

**What is a neural network?**
A neural network is a computing system inspired by biological brains. It consists of interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) that process information. Each connection has a weight that determines how much influence one node has on another. Neural networks learn by adjusting these weights based on training data.

**Training a model involves several key concepts:**

**Transformers**
The architecture that powers modern language models. Transformers excel at understanding context and relationships between words, even when they're far apart in a sentence. They use an "attention mechanism" to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating each part of the output.

**Training data**
The text, images, or other information used to teach the model. Quality and diversity of training data significantly impact model performance. Modern LLMs are trained on billions of web pages, books, and articles.

**Cut-off date**
The latest date of information included in training data. Models don't automatically know about events after their cut-off date, which is why they can't provide information about very recent developments.

**Weights and Parameters**
The numerical values that determine how the model processes information. Large language models have billions or trillions of parameters. During training, these values are adjusted to improve the model's predictions.

**Context**
The amount of previous information the model can consider when generating a response. Larger context windows allow models to maintain coherence over longer conversations or documents.

**Input and Output size**
Limits on how much information can be processed at once. Input size affects how much text you can include in a prompt, while output size determines the maximum length of generated responses.

**Seed**
A number used to make AI outputs reproducible. Using the same seed with identical inputs should produce the same output, which is useful for testing and debugging.

**Vocabulary**
The set of tokens the model understands. Larger vocabularies allow models to handle more languages and specialized terms but require more computational resources.

**Attention**
The mechanism that allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating each part of the output. This enables understanding of long-range dependencies and context.

**Foundational concepts:**

**Vectors**
Mathematical representations of concepts as lists of numbers. Words, images, and other data are converted into vectors that capture their meaning and relationships.

**Embeddings**
High-dimensional vector representations that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts have similar embeddings, allowing models to understand relationships between different ideas.

**Inference**
The process of using a trained model to generate predictions or responses. This is what happens when you send a prompt to an AI model and receive a response.

For a comprehensive deep dive into how these concepts work together, [Andrej Karpathy's tutorial on building ChatGPT from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) provides an excellent technical foundation.

## GenAI part 2

### Function calling

**Function calling** allows AI models to use external tools and services during their responses. Instead of only generating text, the model can call predefined functions to perform specific actions like checking the weather, calculating mathematical expressions, or retrieving current information from databases.

**How it works:**

1. You define functions with clear descriptions of what they do and what parameters they need
2. The AI model analyzes your prompt and determines if any functions would help answer your question
3. The model calls the appropriate function with the right parameters
4. The function returns results, which the model incorporates into its response

**Example function definition:**

```text
Function: get_flight_duration
Description: Calculate flight duration between two airports
Parameters:
  - departure_airport: IATA airport code (e.g., "JFK", "LAX")
  - arrival_airport: IATA airport code (e.g., "JFK", "LAX")
  - include_layovers: Boolean, whether to include connection time

Example usage:
User: "How long does it take to fly from New York to Los Angeles?"
Model: Calls get_flight_duration("JFK", "LAX", true)
Function returns: "6 hours 30 minutes including one layover"
```

**How the model matches functions to prompts:**
Models use the function descriptions and parameter details to understand when a function is relevant. They look for keywords, context clues, and the type of information being requested. The better your function descriptions, the more accurately the model will know when and how to use them.

**Benefits:**

- Access to real-time information
- Ability to perform precise calculations
- Integration with external systems and databases
- More accurate and up-to-date responses

**More information:**

- [Let's Learn Model Context Protocol with JavaScript and TypeScript]({{ "/2025-07-21-Lets-Learn-Model-Context-Protocol-with-JavaScript-and-TypeScript.html" | relative_url }})

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**What is MCP and what problem does it solve?**
Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables AI models to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Before MCP, each AI application had to build custom integrations for every service they wanted to connect to. MCP creates a standardized way for AI models to access external resources, making it easier to build AI applications that can interact with real-world systems.

**Key components:**

- **Host**: The application that contains the AI model (like your IDE, chat application, or development environment)
- **Client**: The component that communicates with MCP servers on behalf of the AI model
- **Server**: The service that provides access to external resources like databases, APIs, or file systems

**How does it relate to OpenAI function calling?**
MCP and OpenAI function calling serve similar purposes but work at different levels:

- **Function calling** is a feature within specific AI models that allows them to call predefined functions
- **MCP** is a protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect to external services, which can then expose functions to the AI

Think of function calling as the language AI models use to request external actions, while MCP is the standardized postal service that delivers those requests to the right destinations.

**Security considerations:**
Current MCP implementations have limited security features, but improvements are coming:

- **OAuth support** is in development ([draft specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization))
- **Temporary solutions** like [Auth0 & Cloudflare](https://auth0.com/blog/secure-and-deploy-remote-mcp-servers-with-auth0-and-cloudflare/) provide security for remote MCP servers
- **Server isolation** and central registries are being developed to improve security

**Risks to consider:**

- MCP servers can access external systems, so proper security and access controls are essential
- Always validate and sanitize data from external sources
- Consider the privacy implications of connecting AI models to sensitive data sources

**Learning resources:**

- [MCP course on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/learn/mcp-course/unit0/introduction) provides comprehensive training
- Microsoft is working on enhanced MCP support with better security features

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**What is RAG and why is it important?**
Retrieval Augmented Generation combines the power of AI language models with access to specific, up-to-date information from external sources. Instead of relying solely on the AI's training data (which has a cut-off date), RAG allows the model to retrieve relevant information from documents, databases, or knowledge bases in real-time and use that information to generate more accurate responses.

**How RAG works:**

1. Your question is processed to understand what information is needed
2. A search system finds relevant documents or data from your knowledge base
3. The retrieved information is combined with your original question
4. The AI model generates a response based on both your question and the retrieved information

**Why RAG is valuable:**

- Provides access to current information beyond the model's training cut-off
- Allows AI to work with your specific company data and documents
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual sources
- Enables AI to cite sources and provide verifiable information

**How does it differ from MCP and function calling?**

**RAG** is primarily about retrieving and using information from documents and knowledge bases. It's focused on finding relevant text or data to inform the AI's response.

**MCP** provides a standardized protocol for AI models to connect to various external services and tools, which could include RAG systems but also databases, APIs, and other services.

**Function calling** is the mechanism AI models use to invoke specific operations, which could include RAG searches, MCP server interactions, or direct API calls.

**When to use each approach:**

**Use RAG when:**

- You need AI to answer questions about specific documents or knowledge bases
- You want responses grounded in verifiable sources
- You're dealing with information that changes frequently
- You need to work with proprietary or domain-specific content

**Use MCP when:**

- You need standardized connections to multiple external services
- You want to build reusable integrations across different AI applications
- You need secure, protocol-based access to external resources

**Use function calling when:**

- You need the AI to perform specific actions (calculations, API calls, data operations)
- You want direct control over what external services the AI can access
- You're building custom integrations for specific use cases

### Agents & Agentic AI

**What makes something an agent?**
An AI agent is a system that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with external environments to achieve specific goals. Unlike simple AI models that respond to individual prompts, agents can:

- Plan multi-step tasks
- Use tools and external services
- Learn from feedback and adapt their approach
- Operate with some degree of independence
- Maintain context across multiple interactions

**Is there a formal definition or interface?**
While there's no single universal definition, most AI agents share common characteristics:

- **Autonomy**: Can operate without constant human intervention
- **Goal-oriented**: Work toward specific objectives
- **Environment interaction**: Can perceive and act upon their environment
- **Tool use**: Can access and utilize external resources
- **Planning**: Can break down complex tasks into manageable steps

**What's the difference compared to MCP servers?**
**MCP servers** provide specific services and tools that AI models can access through a standardized protocol. They're typically focused on particular functions (like database access or file management).
