### Overview

Erik Ejlskov Jensen hosts a session on On .NET Live, focusing on modern SQL Server development using .NET technologies. The presentation highlights how developers can leverage the capabilities of .NET, regardless of operating system, to enhance SQL development practices with various tools and approaches.

### Key Topics Discussed

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Developers can use .NET on Windows, Linux, or macOS to work on SQL Server projects seamlessly.
- **Build Validation and Static Code Analysis**: The integration of build validation and static code analysis in SQL Server projects helps ensure code quality and catch issues early in the development process.
- **.NET Build SDK and NuGet Packages**: The session introduces leveraging the .NET SDK and available NuGet packages to automate and optimize database code management.
- **.NET Global Tooling**: Demonstrates how a .NET global tool can streamline repetitive tasks and integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

### Practical Benefits

- Improved development speed and confidence through automated analysis and validation.
- Simplifies dependency management and tooling with NuGet and global tools.
- Enhances code consistency and quality in SQL Server projects.

### Who Should Watch

- .NET developers working with SQL Server
- Database professionals interested in modern DevOps workflows
- Anyone seeking to streamline SQL development with open, cross-platform tools

### Additional Resources

- Official .NET SDK documentation
- NuGet package registry for SQL development tools
- Community forums and GitHub repositories for related tooling
