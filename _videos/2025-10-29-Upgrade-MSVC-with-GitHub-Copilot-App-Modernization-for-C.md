# Upgrade MSVC with GitHub Copilot App Modernization for C++

GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is a new feature—currently available in Private Preview—that helps developers upgrade their C++ projects to the most recent Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools.

## Key Features

- **Automated Retargeting**: The tool assists with retargeting C++ projects so they leverage the latest build technologies from Microsoft.
- **Guided Code Adjustments**: Copilot analyzes your source code and project files, identifying areas where changes are needed due to deprecations or fixes in the latest MSVC version.
- **Iterative Assistance**: After retargeting, Copilot iterates with you to resolve warnings and errors, offering suggestions and code changes until the project builds cleanly.

## How It Works

1. **Sign up for Private Preview**: Developers interested in testing this feature can join via [this registration link](https://aka.ms/cpp-agents-private-preview).
2. **Project Migration**: Once enrolled, you can retarget existing C++ projects. Copilot assists by:
   - Flagging deprecated features or APIs
   - Recommending necessary source and project changes
   - Walking through build errors and offering contextual fixes
3. **Resource and Support**: Further details are available at [aka.ms/cppagents](https://aka.ms/cppagents).

## Benefits

- Keeps projects up to date with the modern C++ toolchain
- Reduces manual effort during complex migration tasks
- Integrates Copilot's AI-powered suggestions with practical developer workflows
