# On .NET Live – Source Generators in Jinget

**Featuring:** Maira Wenzel, Scott Addie, Vahid Farahmandian (@jinget)

## Overview

.NET Source Generators, a feature introduced in .NET 5, empower developers to implement compile-time code generation within their applications. This capability streamlines workflows by automating repetitive tasks, optimizing performance, and significantly reducing the boilerplate found in codebases.

The Jinget framework, highlighted in this session, utilizes Source Generators to facilitate cleaner, more efficient, and highly productive development experiences. Guest speaker Vahid Farahmandian discusses the evolution of Jinget, practical use cases, and the strategies employed to harness Source Generators for tangible benefits.
