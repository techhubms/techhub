# Enveda: Accelerating Pharmaceutical Discovery with Microsoft AI

**Presented by Microsoft Cloud | Featuring Viswa Colluru, CEO & Founder, Enveda**

In this AI Challenger video, Viswa Colluru discusses Enveda's innovative use of Microsoft AI to transform the pharmaceutical discovery process. By applying AI to chemical and biological data, Enveda is able to:

- Unlock hidden chemical codes within natural sources
- Identify and characterize novel molecules faster than traditional methods
- Enhance drug discovery pipelines with automated, data-driven insights
- Deliver clinical trial candidates four times faster and at around one-tenth the typical cost

Viswa Colluru explains how this approach is shifting the pace of pharmaceutical innovation, allowing for:

- Rapid translation of discoveries from lab to clinic
- Dramatic cost reduction in R&D efforts
- Improved ability to solve complex chemical challenges that were previously intractable
