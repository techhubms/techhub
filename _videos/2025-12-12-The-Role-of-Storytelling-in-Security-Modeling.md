# The Role of Storytelling in Security Modeling

## Introduction

Storytelling can be more impactful in security modeling than purely theoretical approaches. Michael Howard from Microsoft examines why narratives about real incidents resonate more deeply with teams than technical jargon or abstract threat trees.

## Why Storytelling Works

- **Real-World Impact**: Stories based on real incidents highlight practical consequences and encourage teams to engage with risks, not just learn theoretical concepts.
- **Improved Communication**: Crafting a narrative around security challenges helps teams internalize lessons and understand motivation behind certain policies or mitigation strategies.
- **Changing Behaviors**: A well-told story can lead to tangible changes in how teams prioritize and address security issues.

## Moving Beyond Theory

- **Threat Trees & Crypto**: While these are important, they don't always connect with every stakeholder.
- **Incident Narratives**: Describing what actually happened in a security breach—and how it was detected, managed, and remediated—gives teams actionable context.

## Takeaways

- Use storytelling alongside traditional security modeling techniques.
- Make relevant, incident-based stories part of your security reviews and training.
- Reflect on past real-world problems to inform modeling and prevention strategies.
