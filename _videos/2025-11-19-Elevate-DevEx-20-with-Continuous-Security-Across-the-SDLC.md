# Elevate DevEx 2.0 with Continuous Security Across the SDLC

## Overview

This session highlights modern advances in developer experience (DevEx 2.0), with a focus on integrating robust security guardrails into every phase of the software delivery lifecycle. The presentation is part of Microsoft Ignite 2025 and provides actionable strategies for accelerating delivery while maintaining high security standards.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Integration of Azure and GitHub Pipelines:**
  - Continuous security checks integrated directly into development workflows.
  - Use of IDE coaching to guide developers towards secure coding practices.

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
  - Security tests triggered on every commit.
  - Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code.

- **Use of Microsoft Copilot and Azure OpenAI (GPT-5):**
  - AI-powered triage helps prioritize security issues and reduce false positives.
  - Developers receive actionable fixes directly in code.
  - Machine learning models learn from project history to improve future scans.

- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Generation:**
  - Builds automatically generate SBOMs to track component provenance and risk.

- **Container Scanning and Dependency Checks:**
  - Automated checks block builds with unresolved vulnerabilities or unsafe dependencies.

- **Staging and Pre-Production Security Measures:**
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and API testing performed in staging environments.
  - Collection of evidence and risk tracking for compliance and audit purposes.

- **Unified Continuous Security Funnel via AppScan:**
  - Centralized security management and reporting across SDLC.

## Chapters Breakdown

1. **Integrating RapidFix for Innovation and Security Alignment**
2. **Addressing Vulnerabilities from Third-Party Libraries with SCA**
3. **AppScan Checks Dependencies and Blocks Vulnerable Builds**
4. **Introducing AppScan’s Unified Continuous Security Funnel**
5. **Importance of Test Evidence and Risk Tracking**
6. **AI-Driven Triage and Prioritization of Security Issues**
7. **AI-driven Learning from App History to Improve Future Scans**

## Notable Insights from Colin Bell’s Session

- Actionable security advice delivered at the developer's fingertips.
- Reduction in delivery friction using AI for smarter security triage.
- Alignment of innovation and governance for rapid, secure releases.
