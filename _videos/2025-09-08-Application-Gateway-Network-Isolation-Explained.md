# Application Gateway Network Isolation Explained

Azure has introduced a new Network Isolation capability for Application Gateway, which enables users to restrict and control network traffic more effectively within their cloud architectures. This video covers the following key topics:

- **Overview of Application Gateway**: Understanding its role as an Azure load balancer and application delivery controller for web applications.
- **Network Isolation Explained**: How network isolation works with Application Gateway, including separation of resources, restricted subnet access, and traffic segmentation for enhanced security.
- **Implementation Basics**: Steps to enable and configure network isolation on Application Gateway, requirements regarding Virtual Networks (VNets), and integration with other Azure security features.
- **Security Benefits**: The impact of network isolation on reducing attack surfaces, improving compliance, and supporting multi-tenant application scenarios.
- **Use Cases**: Scenarios where network isolation is particularly valuable, such as hosting applications for different business units or customers with strict security requirements.

## Best Practices

- Deploy Application Gateway into dedicated subnets for maximum isolation.
- Integrate with Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) for granular access control.
- Monitor traffic patterns and apply further segmentation as needed.

By leveraging network isolation with Application Gateway, organizations can better safeguard their cloud-hosted applications and meet stringent security requirements.
