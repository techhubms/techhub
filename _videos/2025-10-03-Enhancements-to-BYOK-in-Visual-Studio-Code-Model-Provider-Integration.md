# Bring Your Own Key Enhancements in Visual Studio Code

In this Visual Studio Code livestream, Pierce Boggan presents updates to the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) experience. The highlight is the introduction of the Language Model Chat Provider API, allowing model providers to contribute language models through VS Code extensions.

## What's New?

- **Model Provider Extensions:** Easily install extensions that add support for additional language models, making your model selection broader without complex setup.
- **Language Model Chat Provider API:** A new API that enables extension authors to integrate and manage language models within VS Code, offering a seamless experience for both extension developers and users.

## Developer Benefits

- Expand the AI integration possibilities in your development workflow by leveraging third-party or custom language models.
- Simplifies the extension process for new model supportâ€”just install an extension to access more LLMs.
- Gives teams the flexibility to use organization-specific or preferred models securely.
