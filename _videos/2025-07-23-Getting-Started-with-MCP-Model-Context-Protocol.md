description: "This introductory video by Dan Clarke, hosted on Nick Chapsas' channel, explains the new Model Context Protocol (MCP) concept. With the rapid growth of AI and large language models (LLMs), MCP provides a unified approach for interfacing with data across different LLMs. The session covers what MCPs are, why they matter, and how developers might use them, especially in Microsoft technology stacks like C# and .NET."

# Getting Started with MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Presented by Dan Clarke on Nick Chapsas' channel**

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new concept aimed at providing developers with a standardized and consistent way to interact with data across different large language models (LLMs). As AI and LLM adoption surges, MCPs are designed to simplify and streamline these integrations.

## What You'll Learn

- What the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is
- The significance of MCP in the context of AI and LLMs
- How MCP could unify how developers access and transfer data among various LLMs
- Relevance to Microsoft developers, especially those working with C# and .NET
