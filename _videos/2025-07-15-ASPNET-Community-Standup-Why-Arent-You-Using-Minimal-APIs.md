### ASP.NET Community Standup - Why Aren't You Using Minimal APIs?

**Featured Speakers:** Daniel Roth, Mike Kistler, Safia Abdalla

In this ASP.NET Community Standup episode, the panel discusses the case for using Minimal APIs in new API projects. Key topics include:

#### Strengths of Minimal APIs

- **Simplicity:** Minimal APIs allow for quick, concise, and straightforward definition of endpoints, ideal for smaller web APIs and microservices.
- **Performance:** By trimming away MVC conventions and infrastructure, Minimal APIs can offer faster request processing.
- **Lower Overhead:** Less boilerplate code means easier maintenance and a smaller memory footprint.

#### Controller-Based vs. Minimal APIs

- The panel shares perspectives on why teams may still opt for the controller-based approach, highlighting factors like:
  - Familiarity with traditional ASP.NET MVC patterns
  - Existing project requirements or legacy systems
  - Desire for advanced features like filters and model binding

#### Community Engagement

- The hosts invite input from viewers, welcoming feedback and experiences with either architecture.
- A curated list of helpful community resources is shared ([see link](https://www.theurlist.com/aspnet-standup-20250715)).

#### Conclusion

This session aims to provide developers with the insights needed to make informed architectural decisions for their future .NET API projects, balancing the innovation Minimal APIs bring with the maturity and familiarity of controller-based designs.
