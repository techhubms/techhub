# Future-Proofing Academic Research: Secure AI Computing Workflows with Terawe ManageX on Azure

## Webinar Overview

In this session, Microsoft Cloud and Terawe Corporation introduce how universities can deploy Terawe ManageX on Azure to deliver on-demand, self-provisioned research workspaces. These environments are designed for:

- **Compute-intensive, data-driven, and AI-enabled projects**
- **Customizable compute environments** supporting a range of research workloads
- **Automated data pipelines** for streamlined data management
- **High-performance computing (HPC)**, with the flexibility to scale resources as needed
- **Integrated access to advanced AI models and services**
- **Secure enclaves** and compliance for sensitive research data
- **Researcher autonomy** through self-service provisioningâ€”without direct infrastructure management

## Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Research:** Reduce project timelines with self-service, ready-to-use environments
- **Reduced IT Overhead:** Institutional IT can enable secure, compliant research computing without manual provisioning
- **Policy Compliance:** Tools and workflow patterns to ensure alignment with institutional security and budget policies

## Live Demo Highlights

- **Walkthrough of ManageX workspace creation**
- **Example of an automated data pipeline for research workflows**
- **Integration with cutting-edge AI models on Azure**

## Real-World Case Studies

- How universities leveraged ManageX to scale complex, multi-disciplinary research initiatives
- Examples of supporting data governance, reproducibility, and researcher autonomy
