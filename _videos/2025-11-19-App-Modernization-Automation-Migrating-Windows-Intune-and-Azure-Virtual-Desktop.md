## Overview

Modernizing applications can be stressful for IT teams facing Windows 11 upgrades, SCCM-to-Intune migrations, and the shift to Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) or Windows 365. Common challenges include manual testing, app conflicts, and the risk of downtime.

Rimo3 automation streamlines the process by validating application readiness, automating tests, and ensuring environment stability.

## Key Topics

- **Rimo3 Platform Introduction**: Automates app validation and testing for migration projects.
- **Onboarding Pipeline Stages**:
  - Pipeline overview and automated discovery/baseline testing.
- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Dashboard shows migration status and readiness.
- **Windows Readiness Dashboard**:
  - Specialized tools for OS upgrade testing.
- **Azure Virtual Desktop Testing**:
  - Automated approach for AVD migrations.
- **Failure Analysis**:
  - Integrated tools analyze failed app tests, including video/screenshot review and console output.
- **Package Importing**:
  - Manual or SCCM-based package onboarding.
- **Application Recovery**:
  - Extend menu for remediation/recovery during migration.
- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Keep IT environments evergreen and future-ready.
