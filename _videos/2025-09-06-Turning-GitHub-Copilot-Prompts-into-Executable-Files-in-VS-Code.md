# Turning GitHub Copilot Prompts into Executable Files in VS Code

Did you know you can convert your most complex GitHub Copilot prompts into executable files directly within Visual Studio Code? This feature allows you to save, share, and execute detailed instructions efficiently, making AI-assisted development even more streamlined.

## What Are Prompt Files?

Prompt files let you encapsulate complex Copilot prompts into reusable, shareable files. Instead of retyping or pasting lengthy prompts, you can:

- **Save** prompts for later use
- **Share** prompts with your team
- **Run** prompts with a single click for instant results

## Benefits of Prompt Files

- **Efficient Workflow:** Save time and reduce manual steps.
- **Context Engineering:** Provide Copilot with richer, more detailed context for better results.
- **Team Collaboration:** Promote consistent prompts across projects and teams.

## How to Use Prompt Files in VS Code

1. **Create a Prompt File:** Write your detailed Copilot prompt in a new file within VS Code.
2. **Save and Organize:** Store prompts in an organized folder structure for easy retrieval.
3. **Execute Prompt:** With one click, run the prompt to trigger Copilotâ€™s suggestions or code generation.
4. **Share with Team:** Use version control or direct sharing to distribute prompt files.
