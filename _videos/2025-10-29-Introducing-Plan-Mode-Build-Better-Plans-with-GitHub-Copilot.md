# Introducing Plan Mode: Build Better Plans with GitHub Copilot

GitHub has unveiled Plan Mode, a powerful new feature integrated with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code. Plan Mode is designed to change the way developers approach their coding tasks by guiding them through the initial planning phase before any code is written.

## What is Plan Mode?

Plan Mode allows GitHub Copilot to engage developers in a clarifying dialogue. Before jumping into the coding phase, Copilot prompts you with questions about your desired functionality, use cases, and edge cases. This structured conversation helps you:

- Identify gaps in your requirements
- Spot potential problems early
- Organize your development process step by step

## How It Works

1. **Start Plan Mode**: Enable Plan Mode in GitHub Copilot within VS Code.
2. **Answer Clarifying Questions**: Copilot asks for details regarding your intended functionality and desired outcomes.
3. **Build a Step-by-Step Plan**: Based on your responses, Copilot lays out a logical sequence of steps or tasks to achieve your goals.
4. **Refine and Execute**: Review Copilot’s proposed plan, make adjustments as needed, then move on to code implementation with a clear roadmap.

## Key Benefits

- Ensures better understanding of the task at hand
- Helps catch gaps or oversights early in the process
- Improves code quality and developer productivity
- Reduces the risk of rework caused by unclear requirements

## Try Plan Mode

To get started with Plan Mode:

- Ensure you’re using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code
- Look for the Plan Mode feature in your extension interface
- Follow the prompts to experience step-by-step planning with AI assistance
