# AI Agent Memory: Building Self-Improving Agents

This video lesson from Microsoft Developer offers developers a comprehensive overview of how memory management underpins self-improvement and personalization for AI agents. Key topics include:

## Introduction

Learn why memory is crucial in the context of building effective, adaptive AI agents.

## What is Memory for AI Agents?

A conceptual explanation defining memory in AI agents and its distinctions from traditional software state management.

## Different Types of Memory

Understand various types of memory systems relevant for AI agents, such as short-term and long-term memory, episodic memory, and contextual information storage.

## Methods for Storing Memory

Explore different methods and technologies for managing and persisting agent memory efficiently.

## How Memory Enables Self-Improvement

See how strategic memory design helps AI agents learn from experience, improve over time, and tailor solutions for individual users.

## Code Sample: Mem0 + Semantic Kernel + Azure AI Search

Get hands-on with practical code illustrating:

- How Mem0 can be integrated to create and persist agent memories
- Using Semantic Kernel for orchestrating memory recall and processing
- Leveraging Azure AI Search for scalable memory storage and retrieval

Real examples demonstrate implementing these approaches using Microsoft technologies.

## Wrapping Up

The lesson concludes with a recap of key takeaways and an invitation to explore the sample code provided.
