# Stop Mapping in .NET: Use Facets Instead

**Presented by Nick Chapsas**

## Overview

Nick Chapsas introduces Facet, a .NET library intended to offer a new way for C# developers to handle data mapping. Unlike traditional object mappers, Facet utilizes typed LINQ projections, allowing for efficient and type-safe transformations with minimal overhead.

### What is Facet?

- Facet is a .NET library aimed at replacing typical object mapping strategies.
- It leverages LINQ projections directly, enabling developers to work with type-safe transformations.
- The approach reduces extra overhead often associated with mapping libraries by performing direct projections.

### Key Benefits

- **Typed LINQ Projections**: Eliminates runtime mapping issues by relying on compile-time type checking.
- **Performance**: Reduces mapping overhead.
- **Simplicity**: Streamlines the mapping process by making projections explicit and clear in your code.

### How to Get Started

- Repository: [Facet GitHub](https://github.com/Tim-Maes/Facet)
- Try it out for improved mapping and projections in your next .NET project.
