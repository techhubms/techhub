## Overview

John Savill's latest weekly Azure update brings together a wide spectrum of enhancements and news from the Microsoft Azure ecosystem. He opens by encouraging viewers to use the channel's search capabilities to find specialized content, as he can no longer individually answer questions due to channel growth. Instead, he points users to community forums such as Reddit and the Microsoft Community Hub.

## Key Updates

- **App Service & Connectivity:** Updates include improvements to App Service Hybrid Connection Manager and increased private subnet capabilities.
- **Networking:** Azure Firewall now supports DNAT for private IPs, while Application Gateway introduces Server-Side Encryption (SSE). Azure Front Door (AFD) now accommodates container app and function origins with managed identity authentication.
- **API Management (APIM):** Many APIM changes are discussed—session-aware balancing, LLM logging, workspace metrics, federated logging, Foundry import, standard v2 private endpoint support, applications, a new premium v2 tier, AWS Bedrock API support, and MCP support.
- **Storage & Databases:** Major disk options receive updates, such as ANF CMK managed HSM and disk resizing for Premium SSD v2 and Ultra disks. Azure Backup gains Elastic SAN support; PostgreSQL is now versionless with customer-managed key (CMK) integration.
- **Cosmos DB:** Includes new JavaScript SDK 4.0, support for MongoDB change streams, function trigger/binding, and a DocumentDB Docker image.
- **API Center & Migration:** API Center introduces a free tier, and Azure Migrate gets support for Ultra disk and app awareness.
- **Planetary Computer & AI Foundry:** The Microsoft Planetary Computer Pro and Sora's addition to the Azure AI Foundry are highlighted. There are notable AI content updates, including Foundry content filtering and spotlight features.

## Additional Resources

John shares links to detailed learning paths, master classes (covering Azure, DevOps, PowerShell), a certification content repository, and a dedicated FAQ. He promotes the use of subtitles for accessibility and points to a demo for language translation support on his YouTube channel.

## Closing

This update offers an extensive look across the Azure landscape, beneficial for cloud professionals, developers, and anyone keeping up with Microsoft’s fast-paced cloud innovation.
