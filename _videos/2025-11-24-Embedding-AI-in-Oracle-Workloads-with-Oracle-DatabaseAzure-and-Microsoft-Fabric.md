# Embedding AI in Oracle Workloads with Oracle Database@Azure and Microsoft Fabric

**Speakers:** Sudhakar Dalavi, Venkataraman Ramakrishnan, Rajya Laxmi Yellajosyula  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 - BRK164  
**Level:** Intermediate (200)

## Overview

This session demonstrates how organizations can leverage Azure’s cloud ecosystem to bring advanced AI and analytics to their Oracle workloads. Attendees will learn about practical blueprints for embedding AI across the Oracle application and database stack using Microsoft Foundry, Copilot Studio (developer-focused AI builder), and Microsoft Fabric, enabling new insights and automation with reliable integration patterns.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Dual Cloud Challenges:** Latency, complexity, compliance, and data silos faced when operating across cloud platforms.
- **Financial Product Design & Data Analytics:** How AI-infused analytics can enhance product design workflows.
- **Blueprints & Integration Patterns:**
  - Data unification between Oracle and Azure
  - AI-enriched analytics using Fabric
  - Blueprint for operationalizing analytics on unified data
- **Demonstrations:**
  - Vectorizing Oracle data with Microsoft Fabric
  - Building task-specific copilots and agents using Copilot Studio and GitHub Copilot
  - Custom copilot development combining structured/unstructured data via Azure AI Search
- **Security & Governance:** Role-based access with Microsoft Purview for data protection and compliance
- **Best Practices:** Cost and reliability considerations, customer-validated integration scenarios
