# Azure Top 3 Reliability Actions

In this session, John Savill explores the most impactful steps organizations should take to enhance the reliability of their Microsoft Azure solutions. Drawing from the latest Microsoft guidance, the video focuses on principles and actions that are often overlooked but crucial for building resilient cloud architectures.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Use Availability Zones**  
   Take advantage of Azure's Availability Zones to protect services from datacenter-level failures. Implementing Availability Zones adds an extra layer of fault tolerance for critical workloads.

2. **Choose the Right Network Gateway SKUs**  
   Selecting appropriate SKUs for your network gateways ensures sufficient performance and service resiliency. The choice of SKU can impact failover capabilities and support for scaling as your infrastructure grows.

3. **Design for Robust Network Connectivity**  
   Reliable network architecture is central to availability. Use redundant network paths, right-size your connections, and regularly test connectivity to guard against failures.
