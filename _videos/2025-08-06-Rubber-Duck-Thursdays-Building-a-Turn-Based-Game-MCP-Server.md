# Rubber Duck Thursdays - Building a Turn-Based Game MCP Server

Join the GitHub team for a casual live coding stream, "Rubber Duck Thursdays," where they collaborate on building a turn-based-game MCP server. This session includes:

- **Hands-On Coding**: Watch as the developers iterate on the game server, sharing their thought process and development workflow.
- **Community Engagement**: Viewers are invited to take part in "For the love of code," enhancing the sense of collaborative learning.
- **GitHub Copilot Showcase**: The stream features practical demonstrations of GitHub Copilot's suggestions and how it can accelerate development tasks within real-world projects.
- **Project Resources**:
  - [Participate in 'For the love of code'](https://gh.io/love-of-code)
  - [Explore the turn-based-game MCP server](https://gh.io/rdt/game-mcp)
  - [Latest GitHub releases](https://gh.io/rdt/changelog)
  - [Try out GitHub Copilot](https://gh.io/rdt/copilot)
