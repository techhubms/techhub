# What is Azure AI Foundry Local?

**Presenter:** Dona Sarkar (Microsoft Developer)

Azure AI Foundry Local enables organizations to deploy, run, and manage AI models entirely within their own infrastructure, rather than relying solely on cloud-based services. This approach is increasingly important for industries and scenarios where:

- **Privacy requirements** demand that sensitive data does not leave the local environment.
- **Security regulations** restrict cloud data processing.
- **Offline operation** is a necessity, such as in remote locations or edge environments with limited internet access.

## Key Benefits

- **Privacy:** Data remains on-premises, helping organizations meet compliance requirements.
- **Security:** Local execution minimizes the risk associated with transmitting data to external cloud services.
- **Offline Capability:** AI workloads can be performed without internet connectivity, useful for disconnected or remote use cases.

## Typical Use Cases

- Regulated industries (e.g., healthcare, government, financial services)
- Industrial IoT and edge deployments
- Environments with strict data sovereignty requirements
- Scenarios requiring rapid inference without network latency

## Why It Matters

Azure AI Foundry Local offers flexibility for enterprises who need to balance the advantages of cloud AI with the realities of business constraints and sensitive data. By enabling local deployment and management, it bridges critical gaps in privacy, security, and operational continuity.
