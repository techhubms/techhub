# What is GitHub Secret Protection?

GitHub's Secret Protection helps developers prevent sensitive information, such as API keys and tokens, from accidentally being pushed to repositories. This video explains the risks of exposing secrets and demonstrates the following capabilities:

## Key Features

- **Real-time Secret Scanning**: Every code push is scanned for known secret patterns to catch leaks before they happen.
- **Detection of Non-standard Passwords**: GitHub Copilot assists in detecting secrets that might not follow common patterns, helping catch even customized credentials in code.
- **Automatic Protection**: Alerts and recommended actions are provided when secrets are found, enabling developers to quickly revoke or rotate exposed credentials.

## Best Practices Covered

- Avoid hardcoding secrets directly in code.
- Use environment variables and secret managers.
- Enable secret scanning and set up protection rules in GitHub repositories.

## Why Secret Protection Matters

- Preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information protects both users and organizations from potential breaches or misuse.
- Integrating security checks into the development process ensures compliance and improves CI/CD security.

For step-by-step guidance, follow GitHubâ€™s official documentation and stay updated on security best practices.
