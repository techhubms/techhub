- Easy integration as APIs or MCP (Microsoft Copilot Platform) servers

### Key Topics Covered

- **Live Demo**: Insurance claim processing agent
    - Retrieval of historical data from Azure Databases
    - Claim approval time calculation
    - Use of Cosmos DB for storage and data integration
- **Document-Centric Workflows**
    - Content understanding tools for automating document review and data extraction
- **Model Version Control**
    - Introducing support for different model versions allowing users to select GPT models aligning with their needs
- **Privacy and Security**
