# Integrating Azure AI Foundry Models with GitHub Copilot Using the AI Toolkit

In this episode, April from Microsoft Developer demonstrates how GitHub Copilot can utilize Azure AI Foundry models as its underlying language model in Visual Studio Code. This guide is valuable for developers looking to enhance their coding assistance with enterprise-grade, custom models.

## What You'll Learn

- **Creating an Azure AI Foundry Project:** Step-by-step instructions for setting up a new project within Azure AI Foundry.
- **Deploying Foundry Models:** How to deploy pre-trained and custom models using the AI Toolkit.
- **Using Deployed Models with Copilot:** Procedures to select your deployed Foundry model for direct use as the LLM behind GitHub Copilot within VS Code.
- **Optional Steps:** Usage of the Foundry Local model and configuring local deployments for advanced scenarios.
