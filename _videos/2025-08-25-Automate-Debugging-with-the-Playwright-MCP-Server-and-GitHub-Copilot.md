# Automate Debugging with the Playwright MCP Server and GitHub Copilot

**Author:** GitHub

This video demonstrates how GitHub Copilot Agent Mode can leverage the Playwright MCP server to automate and accelerate the debugging process in software development projects.

## Overview

GitHub Copilot, in its Agent Mode, doesn't just suggest code—it also acts as an AI peer programmer. By using the Playwright MCP (Microsoft Code Platform) server, Copilot gains new abilities to:

- Reproduce reported bugs and confirm their existence
- Explore project files and environment via automated navigation
- Pinpoint the root cause of discovered issues
- Apply targeted code fixes automatically
- Retest and validate that the applied fix resolves the original problem

## Video Structure

- **00:00 Debugging with Playwright MCP Server:** Introduction to the integration and purpose.
- **00:42 Checking Frontend & Network:** Demonstration of investigative steps Copilot performs automatically.
- **01:18 Fixing the Bug:** How Copilot iterates to remedy and confirm resolution.

## Key Technologies

- **GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode):** AI-powered coding assistant capable of suggesting, editing, and now debugging code.
- **Playwright MCP Server:** Enables automated testing, navigation, and diagnosis within the project.

## How It Works

1. **Sharing a Bug Report:** The user provides a detailed bug report to Copilot Agent Mode.
2. **Bug Reproduction:** Copilot, using Playwright, runs automated scenarios to reproduce the reported issue.
3. **Root Cause Investigation:** Following successful reproduction, Copilot examines the codebase to find likely causes.
4. **Automated Fix:** Copilot generates a corrective code change.
5. **Fix Verification:** Playwright re-runs the scenario to verify the issue is resolved.

## Benefits

- **Automation in Debugging:** Developers save time on manual diagnosis and testing.
- **AI Augmentation:** Copilot acts as an AI peer in daily workflows.
- **Project Insights:** Greater reliability in confirming and resolving bugs.
