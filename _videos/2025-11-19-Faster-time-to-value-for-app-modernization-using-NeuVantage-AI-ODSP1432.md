# Faster time-to-value for App Modernization Using NeuVantage AI

**Speakers**: Hiren Dhaduk, Matthew Wendel  
**Session Code**: ODSP1432  
**Event**: Microsoft Ignite 2025

## Overview

Modernizing enterprise applications can be slowed by complex assessments, hidden dependencies, and an unclear return on investment. This session outlines how Simform NeuVantage uses Azure-based AI capabilities to streamline the transition from discovery to production.

### Key Topics Covered

- **AI-driven Portfolio Analysis**:
  - Automatically identifies candidates for modernization within application portfolios.
  - Evaluates existing infrastructure and flags critical limitations using AI-powered discovery.

- **Modernization Path Recommendations**:
  - AI suggests the optimal modernization approach (rehost, replatform, refactor) for each app.
  - Built-in analytics clarify cost savings and resources needed for each path.

- **Azure Integration and Resource Breakdown**:
  - Breaks down Azure resources, showing how existing workloads might map to modern Azure services.
  - Provides download packages with deployment artifacts and scripts.

- **Automation and Workflow Acceleration**:
  - Automates several repeatable tasks in the modernization process.
  - Generates Terraform templates and deployment scripts for faster implementation.

- **Session Structure**:
  - Initiation of a new assessment creation.
  - Cost savings overview with Azure resource analysis.
  - Assessment of current on-prem/cloud infrastructure.
  - Summary of recommended Azure services.
  - Downloadable package with modernization artifacts.
  - Demonstration of comprehensive capabilities including infrastructure-as-code generation.

## Audience Takeaways

- Learn how to harness AI for rapid app modernization assessments on Azure.
- Understand the technical underpinnings of recommending and implementing modernization approaches.
- See automation in action: reducing manual steps through Terraform and scripts.
