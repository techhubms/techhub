# Open Source Friday with Suricata - Real-Time Threat Detection

Hosted by GitHub, this live session focuses on **Suricata**, a high-performance open-source Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) designed to analyze network traffic in real time. The event includes:

- **Intro to Suricata**: What it is, its capabilities, and why it matters for modern network security.
- **Configuration Tuning**: Demonstrations on optimizing Suricata for multi-threaded, high-speed environments.
- **Rule Management**: Live walkthrough of how to apply and manage detection rules using `suricata-update`.
- **Packet Analysis**: Explaining Suricata’s approach to packet inspection and protocol analysis.
- **Integration**: Connecting Suricata logs to the ELK stack for comprehensive security analytics.
- **EVE JSON Output**: Practical sessions on configuring detailed JSON logging for automated downstream analysis.
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for deploying Suricata in both testing and production environments, including scalability strategies.

## Key Takeaways

- Understand real-time network threat detection with Suricata
- Learn the basics and advanced features of the tool
- See real use cases for ELK stack integration
- Tips for efficient rule and log management

**Q&A** is anticipated throughout the event to address community questions about deploying Suricata in different scenarios.
