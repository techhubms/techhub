# Do you security check AI models you pull from online repos?: Developer Security Quick Fire Questions

*Author: Microsoft Developer*

## Overview

During Microsoft Build 2025, the Microsoft Developer team approached attendees and special guests with quick fire questions focused on developer securityâ€”specifically regarding the practice of using AI models sourced from online repositories.

## Key Discussion Points

- **Developer Security Awareness:** Interviewees shared methods and considerations for maintaining a secure software environment when pulling AI models from external sources.
- **Risks of Online AI Models:** The video explores potential risks associated with using AI models found in public repositories, raising awareness about code provenance, model integrity, and hidden vulnerabilities.
- **Security Best Practices:** Suggestions included verifying sources, checking for official or well-maintained repositories, scanning models for malicious content, and using automated tools for dependency and vulnerability checking.
- **Secure Future Initiative:** The video mentions Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative ([SFI](http://aka.ms/SFIwebsite)), which provides resources and frameworks for improving security across development lifecycles, especially as AI integration becomes more commonplace.

## Resources

For more information on secure development and Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative, refer to the [official SFI website](http://aka.ms/SFIwebsite).

## Conclusion

This developer discussion underlines the increasing importance of treating AI artifacts as critical dependencies requiring rigorous security checks, and encourages the adoption of structured security practices for AI-driven development projects.
