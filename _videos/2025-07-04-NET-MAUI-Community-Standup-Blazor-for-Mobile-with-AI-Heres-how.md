## Enhancing Web Apps with Blazor, .NET MAUI, and Azure AI Foundry

Beth Massi takes center stage in demonstrating the enrichment of a web application by infusing it with native mobile features and AI-powered functionalities. Leveraging the strengths of Blazor for web app development and .NET MAUI for cross-platform native experiences, Massi explores a practical workflow to bridge web and mobile paradigms.

A notable highlight is the integration of Azure AI Foundry, a Microsoft technology providing advanced AI solutions to developers. This allows developers to embed intelligent features—such as language processing and recommendation systems—directly into their apps with ease. Throughout the session, David Ortinau joins Massi to share insights and best practices.

The article also directs readers to curated community links for ongoing learning and support within the MAUI developer community.

Key topics include:

- Strategies for augmenting web apps with platform-native features using .NET MAUI
- Practical use of Blazor for cross-platform UI
- Integrating AI via Azure AI Foundry
- Insights from leading experts Beth Massi and David Ortinau

This overview makes it clear how developers can use contemporary tooling to take their web apps further, providing both a technical guide and community resources.
