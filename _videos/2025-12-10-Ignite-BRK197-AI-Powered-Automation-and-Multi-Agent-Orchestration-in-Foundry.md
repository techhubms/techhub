# Ignite BRK197: AI Powered Automation & Multi-Agent Orchestration in Foundry

Presented by Microsoft Developer

## Overview

This session introduces developers to advanced methods for constructing and scaling multi-agent systems with Microsoft Foundry. It emphasizes moving beyond single-agent prototypes towards orchestrating a 'fleet' of AI agents using Microsoft technologies.

## Key Technologies & Tools

- **Microsoft Foundry Agent Framework** (combining Semantic Kernel and AutoGen)
- **Shared State Management**
- **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**
- **OpenTel and MCP Toolchains**
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication and Activity Protocol**
- **LangGraph and OpenAI Agents SDK Framework Support**

## Multi-Agent System Building Blocks

- Use Semantic Kernel and AutoGen for agent logic and orchestration
- Implement shared state for agent collaboration and context persistence
- Integrate human stakeholders for oversight and hybrid workflows
- Utilize OpenTel tools for agent observability and monitoring
- MCP toolchains support robust development and deployment
- Deploy agents using governance and containerization best practices in Microsoft Foundry

## Extensibility and Deployment

- Bring in popular external frameworks: LangGraph, OpenAI Agents SDK
- Deploy scalable, governed, and observable agents in production on Microsoft Foundry
- Leverage Azure for underlying infrastructure and cloud scalability

## Resources & Community

- [Join the Microsoft Foundry Discord](https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Discord) for discussions and support
- [Sign up for an Azure Free Trial](https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT) to get started
- [Hands-on MCP Lab Repository](https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay1)
- [Catch up with on-demand content](https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/OnDemand)

## Conclusion

Microsoft Foundry provides a robust foundation for building, orchestrating, and scaling AI multi-agent systems within the Azure ecosystem. Developers can leverage an array of tools and frameworks to create advanced, production-ready AI solutions.
