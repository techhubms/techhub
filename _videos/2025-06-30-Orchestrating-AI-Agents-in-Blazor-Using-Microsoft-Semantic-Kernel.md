# Orchestrating AI Agents in Blazor Using Microsoft Semantic Kernel

**Author:** Learn Microsoft AI

## Overview

Discover how to implement concurrent orchestration of intelligent AI agents using the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework in a Blazor application. This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough, from initial setup to a hands-on demo, detailing code structure and design patterns for scalable agent management.

## Table of Contents

- Overview of Implementation Plan
- Adding Semantic Kernel to Dependency Injection (DI)
- Registering ChatCompletionAgents in DI
- Setting Up the Orchestration Service
- Creating the Agent Resolver
- Implementing the Transformer Handler
- Registering ProcessRuntime & Invoking Agents
- Injecting Orchestration into a Blazor Page
- Agent Orchestration Demo
- Page-Based Orchestration Explained
- Grouping and Injecting Agents Per Page
- Concurrent Orchestration Logic
- Optimization and Code Improvement

## Semantic Kernel in Blazor

- Add **Semantic Kernel** to your Blazor app via Dependency Injection for centralized management.

## Registering Agents

- Register specialized agents (e.g., Movies Agent, Food Agent) as services.
- Use `ChatCompletionAgents` for AI-driven dialogue and recommendations.

## Orchestration Service

- Set up a **ConcurrentOrchestrationService** to coordinate multiple agents in parallel.
- Demonstrate parallel execution and concurrent orchestration for increased responsiveness.

## Dependency Injection & Agent Invocation

- Inject orchestration service into desired Blazor pages for dynamic agent management.
- Use an *Agent Resolver* for runtime selection of relevant agents based on user actions or page context.

## Demo Highlights

- Page-based orchestration allows agents to be grouped and invoked based on UI context.
- ProcessRuntime enables seamless and efficient triggering of multiple agents.
- Example: running Movies Agent and Food Agent in the same workflow.

## Use Cases

- Smart chatbots with distinct knowledge domains
- Recommendation systems leveraging multiple specialized agents
- Interactive, responsive AI features in .NET web frontends

## Optimization Areas

- Code organization for scalability
- Enhancing agent resolution strategies
- Improving parallelism and error handling

## Takeaways

- Strong fit for .NET and Blazor developers aiming to build multi-agent, intelligent applications.
- Demonstrates practical orchestration patterns with Microsoft's Semantic Kernel.
