# Automating Developer Tasks with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode and MCP Servers in VS Code

**Presenter:** Liam Hampton

This session showcases practical ways to automate standard developer tasks within Visual Studio Code using GitHub Copilot's Agent mode in conjunction with MCP servers.

## Key Topics Covered

- **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode:**
  - Enables automation of tasks typically performed manually by developers within VS Code.
  - Interacts programmatically with GitHub resources (e.g., pull requests, assigned issues) without writing code.

- **MCP Server Integration:**
  - Utilizes GitHub's MCP server to fetch open pull requests and assigned GitHub issues directly into the developer workflow.
  - Employs a LeetCode MCP server to pull daily coding challenges for skill maintenance.

- **Demonstration Highlights:**
  - Full walkthrough of configuring and running Copilot Agent mode with MCP servers.
  - Real examples of automating recurring developer tasks.
  - Focus on minimizing manual coding for daily productivity improvements.
