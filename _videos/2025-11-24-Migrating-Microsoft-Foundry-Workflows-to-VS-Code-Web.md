# Migrating Microsoft Foundry Workflows to VS Code Web

April, part of the Microsoft Developer team, presents a hands-on tutorial focused on moving Microsoft Foundry workflows into a code-first experience with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for the Web. This method allows developers to quickly obtain the workflow code, review it, and make direct modifications in a cloud-hosted, temporary environment optimized for prototyping.

## Key Steps Covered

- **Obtaining Workflow Code**: April demonstrates where and how to extract code representing Microsoft Foundry agent workflows.
- **Using VS Code for the Web**: Detailed instructions are shown for opening the workflow code in the VS Code web environment. This web-based editor provides immediate access for workflow review and modification without local installation.
- **Review and Iteration**: The video covers how to review workflow logic and make rapid changes directly within VS Code using the Microsoft Foundry extension.
- **Prototyping Benefits**: Emphasizes the utility of VS Code Web’s temporary environments for streamlined prototyping before transitioning to a local development setup.
- **Additional Resources**: References further tutorials for migrating to a full local VS Code experience and links to Microsoft Foundry documentation, Discord, and forums for community engagement.
