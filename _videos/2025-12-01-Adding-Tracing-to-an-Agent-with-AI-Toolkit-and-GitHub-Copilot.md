# Adding Tracing to an Agent with AI Toolkit and GitHub Copilot

**Presenter:** April, Microsoft Developer

This video is Part 5 of the GitHub Copilot + AI Toolkit Pet Planner workshop series. April demonstrates the process of enabling and utilizing tracing with GitHub Copilot in Agent mode, specifically designed for developers building and troubleshooting AI agents.

## What You'll Learn

- **How to use Copilot in Agent mode to add tracing**: Step-by-step guide for activating tracing in your agent files.
- **Collecting trace data**: Running the agent and gathering trace logs on its activities.
- **Reviewing traces**: Inspect traces within the AI Toolkit Tracing viewer to understand how the agent processes data and generates outputs.
- **Practical setup**: Guidance on installing the AI Toolkit and integrating it into your Microsoft Foundry project.

## Video Outline

- **Introduction**: Overview of the workshop and Copilot Agent mode (00:00)
- **Progress Recap**: Quick review of previous steps (00:03–01:21)
- **Enabling Tracing with Copilot**: Configuring your agent file for tracing (01:22–04:09)
- **Running the Agent and Collecting Traces**: Observing AI activity (04:10–04:34)
- **Reviewing Trace Data**: Using the Tracing viewer in AI Toolkit (04:35–07:39)

## Why Tracing Matters

Enabling tracing gives developers clear insight into the inner workings and decision paths of AI agents. This approach facilitates debugging, performance tuning, and transparency when deploying AI-driven applications. The Tracing viewer in AI Toolkit makes it straightforward to audit agent activity.
