# Building Agentic AI Systems in .NET with Local SLMs

## Overview

Agentic AI enables the creation of .NET-based agents that can reason, act autonomously, and collaborate with developersâ€”streamlining enterprise automation with trusted decision flows. This hands-on session demonstrates building agentic systems using local-first Small Language Models (SLMs), integrated with Microsoft Semantic Kernel and key libraries like OllamaSharp and LLamaSharp.

## Key Technologies and Concepts

- **Small Language Models (SLMs):** Utilized locally for lowest latency, data control, and reduced operational costs; deployed on edge or on-premises.
- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel:** Central to coordinating agent workflows, controlling tool usage, and managing state.
- **OllamaSharp & LLamaSharp:** Enable integration with SLMs (via Ollama server or in-process), giving flexibility for server-side or fully local deployments.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Uses in-memory vector stores and embeddings for grounded, accurate responses in business scenarios.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Evaluation:** Provides output evaluation and supports observability/auditing through Semantic Kernel filters.

## Demo Scenarios

- **Autonomous Agents:** Execute tasks independently and can recover from errors using safe recovery loops and state management.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Escalation and approval processes allow agents to defer key decisions to human oversight.

## Architecture Patterns

- **Local-first SLM deployment:** Low latency, strong data control, and cost efficiency for developer and enterprise use.
- **Edge and On-Premises:** Agents can be deployed where data sovereignty and quick response are critical.
- **Observability and Auditing:** Deep integration allows for tracking agent decisions and ensuring compliance.

## Practical Guidance

Attendees walk away with:

- Working C# code samples for agent development with SLMs
- Patterns for integrating agentic AI into existing .NET solutions
- Strategies for evaluating agent output and maintaining production-readiness

## Speakers

Daniel Costea, Cam Soper, Frank Boucher, and Maria Wenzel share real-world expertise, live demos, and actionable solutions.
