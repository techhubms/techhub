description: "This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 introduces NeuBird’s Hawkeye, an AI-powered Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) agent designed for Azure environments. Hawkeye specializes in real-time Root Cause Analysis (RCA), automated remediation, and enterprise-grade security. The presentation covers how the agent correlates telemetry across Azure Monitor, integrates with observability tools across multiple clouds, and aims to reduce Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) by up to 90%. Key chapters include the transition from manual troubleshooting to AI-driven automation and the importance of contextual data processing in incident response."

# Agentic AI SRE on Azure for Faster Incident Resolution

**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Speakers:** François Martel

## Session Overview

Downtime can be costly, with engineering time often consumed by troubleshooting rather than innovation. This session introduces Hawkeye by NeuBird, an agentic AI SRE solution built for Azure, which delivers real-time Root Cause Analysis (RCA), automated remediation, and robust security and governance.

### Key Features

- **AI-Driven Incident Response:** Hawkeye uses artificial intelligence to automate incident management, reducing the reliance on manual processes.
- **Root Cause Analysis & Remediation:** Real-time RCA enables quick identification and resolution of system issues.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Ensures all automation follows strict security and governance requirements.
- **Telemetry Correlation:** Integrates with Azure Monitor and other observability tools across multiple clouds for holistic visibility.
- **Reduced MTTR:** Claims up to 90% reduction in Mean Time To Recovery through AI-driven automation and context-aware data processing.

## Session Chapters

- **Challenges:** Numerous alerts and dashboards can overload operations teams.
- **Product Demo:** Introduction and live demonstration of Hawkeye's capabilities for autonomous IT incident response.
- **Manual to Autonomous:** Transitioning from traditional incident processes to AI automation.
- **Incident Details:** Exploring how Hawkeye provides contextual information for each incident.
- **Manual Interventions:** Dashboard allows for manual investigations when needed.
- **Context Engineering:** Highlights the role of comprehensive data processing in enhancing RCA and remediation accuracy.
- **Summary:** Review of how Hawkeye tackles common SRE pain points on Azure.

## Technologies Highlighted

- Azure Monitor
- Multi-cloud observability tools
- AI automation for SRE
