# Spec Kit and GitHub Copilot: Spec-Driven Development in VS Code with Den

In this session, Den Delimarsky appears alongside James Montemagno, Burke Holland, and Pierce Boggan to showcase the new [Spec-Kit open-source project](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for Visual Studio Code. Spec-Driven Development shifts the development paradigm: instead of treating specifications as temporary scaffolding, they become the central, executable source of truth that can directly generate working code.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

- **Traditional Approach**: Start with specs, but discard them once coding begins.
- **Spec-Driven Development** (_Spec-Kit_): Specs remain centralâ€”generate working implementations directly from the specifications.

## Demo Highlights

- Hands-on demonstration with Spec-Kit in Visual Studio Code.
- Live discussion on workflow: how developers can author, manage, and execute specifications as code.
- Use of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to assist in writing and refining executable specs and code.

## Why Spec-Kit?

- **Open-source toolkit** designed to bring spec-driven workflows to modern development environments.
- Enhances team collaboration by making project intent explicit and actionable.
- Supported by AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot for a streamlined experience.

## Community and Further Reading

- Explore Spec-Kit on [GitHub](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
- Read the [Spec-Driven Development with AI](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/) blog post for technical background and getting started guidance.
