# Modernizing Legacy: COBOL to Cloud with GitHub Copilot

Julia Kordick, Software Global Black Belt at Microsoft, presents a demonstration of how AI-assisted tools such as GitHub Copilot and autonomous agents are revolutionizing large-scale COBOL modernization projects.

## Whatâ€™s Covered

- **Live Demo:** Migrating legacy COBOL applications to modern environments using AI tools
- **Reverse Engineering:** Automated analysis of COBOL code to extract business logic and dependencies
- **Automated Documentation:** Generating rich documentation for legacy systems
- **Test Generation:** Automatically producing test cases based on existing COBOL logic
- **Code Transformation:** Converting COBOL code to modern programming languages using AI-based approaches
- **Project Repository:** Code samples and automation resources available at: [Legacy Modernization Agents GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Legacy-Modernization-Agents)

## Featured Tools and Technologies

- **GitHub Copilot:** AI pair programmer accelerating code migration and documentation
- **Azure Services:** Leveraging Microsoft cloud for deployment and automation
- **Autonomous Agents:** Specialized AI bots that assist in code transformation and testing tasks

## Key Takeaways

- AI tools can significantly reduce the effort needed for legacy code migration
- Automated documentation and test generation ensure higher quality and maintainability
- Code transformation using cloud-based AI platforms accelerates modernization efforts
