# Enterprise-Grade AI Governance with GitHub Copilot and Advanced Security

**Speakers:**

- Kate Catlin, Senior Product Manager, GitHub
- Mario Rodriguez, Chief Product Officer, GitHub
- Todd Manion, VP, Product Management, GitHub

## Overview

This GitHub Universe session explores how agentic AI—like GitHub Copilot—reshapes the developer experience. Enterprise administrators and platform engineers are tasked with building robust foundations where human developers and AI agents collaborate efficiently and securely.

### Key Session Highlights

- **The Future of Agentic Development:** A discussion about new possibilities as autonomous AI agents become part of daily development workflows.
- **Demo: Transforming the SDLC with Custom Agents:** Live demonstration creating and deploying custom AI agents in VS Code and partner integrations (Amplitude, Arm).
- **Enterprise Controls:** Introduction to new GitHub enterprise-grade governance tools enabling admins to maintain balance between developer autonomy and organizational requirements.
- **Feature Announcements:**
  - *Copilot Metrics Dashboard*: Visualize and analyze the impact of Copilot across teams.
  - *Agent Control Plane*: Centralized governance and configuration for AI agents.
- **Live Demos:** Practical walkthroughs of configuring, measuring, and governing AI agents in real-world scenarios.

## Practical Takeaways

- How to deploy and manage custom AI agents using GitHub's latest enterprise features.
- Leveraging Copilot Metrics to monitor AI’s impact on development velocity and code quality.
- Applying security and governance best practices with GitHub Advanced Security.
- Strategies for balancing developer productivity with compliance and operational controls.
