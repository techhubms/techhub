# From UX to AX: Why Agent Experience is the Next Frontier in Business AI

**Featuring:** John Maeda (Guest), Priyanka Vergadia (Host)

The era of AI in business is moving rapidly beyond simple chatbots. In this episode, John Maeda explains the emergence of agents—AI systems that plan, execute, and manage workflows both synchronously and asynchronously—transforming how work gets done.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Agents vs. Chatbots:** Agents are a higher-level abstraction built from models, prompts, and business knowledge, capable of handling workflows and decision making—not just conversations.
- **From UX to AX:** The shift from designing for User Experience (UX) to designing for Agent Experience (AX) requires new thinking about how agents interact with users and business processes.
- **Workflow Automation:** Agents excel at automating multi-step workflows, including data parsing and command line interactions, enabling businesses to multiply workforce efficiency.
- **Computational Thinking:** Success with AI agents isn't just about speaking English to a machine. Combining human intuition with computational strategies is vital to realizing agents' full potential.
- **Business Leadership in AI:** Leaders must move beyond "AI fan fiction"—hands-on learning and engagement with agent technologies is necessary for practical outcomes.

## Breakthrough Moments

- Agents using the command line for automation where GUIs fall short
- Planning and reasoning capabilities introduced with GPT-4
- Parsing unstructured data and executing tasks programmatically
- Necessity for business leaders to get hands-on with AI to understand possibilities and limitations

## Practical Takeaways

- Don’t limit AI adoption to chatbots—focus on agent-driven automation
- Integrate agent workflows in scenarios where structured multi-step actions deliver business value
- Combine prompt engineering with computational thinking to achieve reliable agent outcomes
- Encourage technical and business teams to collaborate on agent experience (AX) design
