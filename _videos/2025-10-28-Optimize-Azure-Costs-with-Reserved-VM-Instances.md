# Optimize Azure Costs with Reserved VM Instances

**Presented by:** Thomas Maurer and Priyanshi Mittal, Microsoft Azure

## Overview

In this episode of the #AzureEssentialsShow, hosts Thomas Maurer and Priyanshi Mittal explain how organizations can better manage and optimize their Azure cloud spending by effectively utilizing Azure Reserved Virtual Machine (VM) Instances.

## Key Topics Covered

- **How Azure Reserved VM Instances Work**  
  Reserved Instances let you pre-pay for virtual machine usage, giving you a discount compared to pay-as-you-go pricing. They provide significant savings for predictable, stable workloads. Reservations apply only to the compute cost for Windows VMs.

- **Using Azure Advisor and Historical Usage Data**  
  Learn how to leverage Azure Advisor and analyze historical usage to identify which VM reservations fit your environment, improving your overall spend efficiency.

- **Best Practices & Common Pitfalls**  
  Key recommendations include:
  - Scoping reservations correctly (single subscription, resource group, or shared scope).
  - Setting up utilization alerts to ensure cost effectiveness.
  - Using auto-renewal to maintain ongoing reservation benefits.

- **Maintaining Performance and Scalability**  
  Discover strategies for optimizing reservations while ensuring your infrastructure can scale according to your business needs.

## Suggested Next Steps

- **Review VM usage:** Check your organization’s VM consumption in Azure Portal.
- **Explore reservation recommendations:** Use Azure Advisor or the purchase flow in the portal to see tailored suggestions.
- **Implement utilization alerts and auto-renewal:** Proactively monitor and manage your reserved instance benefits.
