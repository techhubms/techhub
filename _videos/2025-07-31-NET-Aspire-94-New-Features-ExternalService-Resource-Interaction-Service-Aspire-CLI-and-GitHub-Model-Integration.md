## .NET Aspire 9.4 New Features Overview

Presented by Fritz from the .NET team, this video delves into the latest features available in .NET Aspire version 9.4. The session focuses on practical demonstrations and highlights key enhancements that developers can leverage for building robust applications using .NET Aspire.

### Key Features Introduced

- **ExternalService Resource**
  - This new resource allows seamless integration with external services within the Aspire ecosystem. It streamlines the process of consuming and managing dependencies on third-party APIs or cloud services directly in your Aspire applications.

- **Interaction Service**
  - The Interaction Service provides improved ways for services within your Aspire solution to communicate. It supports advanced interaction and messaging patterns, aiming to make microservices architectures more maintainable and scalable.

- **Aspire CLI**
  - The Aspire Command Line Interface (CLI) has been updated with new commands and capabilities, enabling developers to scaffold, manage, and deploy Aspire projects more efficiently from the command line.

- **GitHub Model Integration**
  - Integration with GitHub Models is showcased, simplifying workflows for teams using GitHub for version control and CI/CD. This feature helps synchronize Aspire configuration and resource models with GitHub repositories for faster and more reliable development cycles.

### Demo Highlights

Throughout the video, Fritz demonstrates:

- Practical creation and management of ExternalService Resources.
- Implementing inter-service communication with the new Interaction Service.
- Leveraging the Aspire CLI for day-to-day developer tasks.
- Setting up and using GitHub Model integration for streamlined DevOps processes.
