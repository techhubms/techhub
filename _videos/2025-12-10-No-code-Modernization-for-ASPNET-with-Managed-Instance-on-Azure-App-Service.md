# No-code Modernization for ASP.NET with Managed Instance on Azure App Service

This video delves into strategies that allow modernization of legacy ASP.NET applications without the need for rewrites. Discover how Managed Instance on Azure App Service, a specialized Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering, removes traditional migration obstacles—such as direct file access, reliance on custom installers, and use of system commands—making it possible to uplift existing web apps efficiently.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Managed Instance Features**: Purpose-built for hosting ASP.NET apps, supporting the full range of .NET capabilities and legacy requirements.
- **Migration Tactics**: Techniques to move apps from on-premises or older hosting environments to Azure App Service Managed Instance with minimal disruption.
- **Performance & Scalability**: Insights into optimizing workloads for cloud scale, boosting overall application performance, and utilizing auto-scaling features.
- **Lower TCO**: Approaches to reducing infrastructure and operational costs by leveraging Azure cloud services.
- **Integration with Modern Workflows**: Demonstration of connecting existing Web APIs to modern agentic workflows for enterprise-level innovation.

## Demo Highlights

- Step-by-step walkthrough of migrating an ASP.NET app to Managed Instance on Azure App Service.
- Overcoming migration blockers such as:
  - File system dependencies
  - Custom installation routines
  - Use of system-level commands
- Practical examples of integrating legacy solutions with modern cloud-native workflows.
