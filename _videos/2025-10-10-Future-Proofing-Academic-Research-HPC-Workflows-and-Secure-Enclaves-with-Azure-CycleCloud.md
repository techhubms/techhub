# Future-Proofing Academic Research: HPC Workflows and Secure Enclaves with Azure CycleCloud

Azure CycleCloud is an enterprise-friendly tool for orchestrating and managing High Performance Computing (HPC) environments on Azure. Researchers can provision cloud infrastructure for HPC systems, deploy familiar job schedulers such as Slurm, and automatically scale resources to efficiently run compute-intensive jobs at any scale.

## What You'll Learn

- **CycleCloud Overview**: Basics of creating and managing HPC clusters in the Azure cloud.
- **Azure CycleCloud Workspace for Slurm (CCWS)**: Rapid deployment of traditional HPC job schedulers with the ability to scale to thousands of cores immediately.
- **Ease-of-Use Integrations**:
  - **Open OnDemand**: User-friendly HPC web portal accessibility.
  - **Grafana** and **Cendio ThinLinc**: Monitoring and remote desktop capabilities for streamlined workflow and visualization.
- **Security & Scalability**: Use of secure enclaves and scalable architecture tailored for academic research and large data workloads.
- **Integration and Community**: How to follow up with the Microsoft Azure for Academic Research community for ongoing content and updates.
