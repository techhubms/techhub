# Plan, Specify, and Implement with Spec Kit and GitHub Copilot

Presented by Microsoft Developer, this session explores **Spec Kit**, an open-source toolkit that assists developers in focusing on clear product scenarios and predictable outcomes rather than starting every codebase from scratch.

## What is Spec Kit?

Spec Kit is designed to facilitate spec-driven development by providing tools and templates that help you define, plan, and implement solutions methodically. Instead of relying on loosely structured or 'vibe' coding, Spec Kit emphasizes structure and clarity.

## Key Highlights

- **Introduction to Spec Kit**: Overview of core capabilities and how it streamlines the specification process for development projects.
- **Setup and Getting Started**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up Spec Kit in your environment.
- **Spec-Driven Development with GitHub Copilot**: Integration with GitHub Copilot enables developers to leverage AI-assisted coding for productive and context-aware development.
- **Hands-on Labs and Further Learning**: Accompanying resources and labs are available for practice and deeper learning.

## Resources

- [Join Microsoft Foundry Discord](https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/Discord)
- [Azure Free Trial](https://aka.ms/AzureFreeTrialYT)
- [VS Code Lab Repo](https://aka.ms/AIDevDays/LabDay2)
