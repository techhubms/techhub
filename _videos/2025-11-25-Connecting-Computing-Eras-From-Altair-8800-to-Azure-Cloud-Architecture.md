title: "Connecting Computing Eras: From Altair 8800 to Azure Cloud Architecture"
description: "Scott Hanselman and Mark Russinovich deliver an advanced demo-driven exploration of computing evolution. The session traces architecture patterns from early personal computers like the Altair 8800 through assembler languages, bootloaders, and community programming to today's hyperscale cloud platforms. Real-world demos illustrate how architectural lessons from 1975 inform the way modern apps are designed, scaled, and delivered on Azure, including REST APIs and new uses for terminals. The talk features historical anecdotes, technical demonstrations, and insights into modern development practices rooted in classic computing."

# Connecting Computing Eras: From Altair 8800 to Azure Cloud Architecture

## Introduction

Join Mark Russinovich and Scott Hanselman for a live, demo-driven session at Microsoft Ignite 2025, bridging historical computing innovation and modern cloud architecture.

## Chapter Highlights

- **Bootloaders Across Eras**: Examines progression from 28-byte boot programs to UEFI and bootloaders powering Azure systems.
- **Abstraction Layers**: Explores the transition from direct machine code to assembler languages, emphasizing the importance of abstraction in scalable systems.
- **Programming Histories**: Mark Russinovich shares his early programming career, including BASIC magazine hex programs and screen dump techniques.
- **Demo: Altair Boots into CP/M**: Live demonstration of booting the Altair emulator, running a classic infinite loop in BASIC, and highlighting errors common in early computing.
- **Tech Community Evolution**: Insights into Sysinternals Newsletter as a pre-social media tech hub for programmers.
- **Open-Sourcing Zork**: Microsoft/Xbox partnership highlights open-source releases of classic games, connecting historic software with modern cloud ecosystems.
- **Modern Terminal Resurgence**: Explains why terminal interfaces are returning in cloud-native development and DevOps workflows.
- **Live Bridge to Altair**: Shows complex, multistep pipelines bridging physical computing devices and modern emulators—illustrating the evolution and inefficiencies of integration.

## Key Themes

- Historical perspective informs current best practices in cloud app architecture
- Lessons from early abstraction, boot processes, and open-source communities shape modern scaling and deployment on Azure
- Embracing the resurgence of terminal interfaces in today’s development workflows

## Practical Takeaways
