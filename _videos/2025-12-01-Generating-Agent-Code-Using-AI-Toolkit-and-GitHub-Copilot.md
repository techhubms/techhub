# Generating Agent Code Using AI Toolkit and GitHub Copilot

**Presented by Microsoft Developer (April)**

This video is Part 4 of the "AI Toolkit + GitHub Copilot" Pet Planner workshop. April demonstrates how to transition from building an agent using AI Toolkit’s Agent Builder to generating functional agent code, leveraging GitHub Copilot for further assistance and enhancement.

## Workshop Overview

- **GitHub Copilot + AI Toolkit Integration**: Streamlines the creation and extension of intelligent agents with code generation support.
- **Pet Planner Example**: Focuses on a practical project, giving context to the generated agent code.

## Key Steps Covered

### 1. Generating the Agent Code

April walks through the code generation process using the AI Toolkit's Agent Builder, illustrating how developers move from agent design to functional code.

### 2. Reviewing and Understanding the Generated Code

Highlights review strategies for the produced agent code, including identifying points for extension and verification of logic.

### 3. Setting Up the Local Development Environment

Detailed guidance on setting up your local environment for running and testing the generated agent code. Steps include installing required toolkits and preparing dependencies.
