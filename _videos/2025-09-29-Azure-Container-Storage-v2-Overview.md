# Azure Container Storage v2 Overview

**Presented by John Savill's Technical Training**

## Introduction

This session explores the latest enhancements in Azure Container Storage (ACStor) v2, designed for modern container workloads running on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Key Topics Covered

- **AKS and CSI (Container Storage Interface):** Context around storage integration for Kubernetes clusters in Azure
- **ACStor v1 vs v2:** Architectural differences, new features
- **Local NVMe Storage:** Benefits and use cases for leveraging fast local storage on VMs
- **VM SKUs:** Guidance on VM size selection for optimal ACStor v2 performance
- **Local Disks and Striping:** Techniques for improving IOPS and throughput by using disk striping
- **Best-fit Workloads:** Identifying the scenarios and workloads that benefit most from ACStor v2
- **Durability Considerations:** Recommendations around data protection, durability, and best practices
- **Performance Improvements:** Benchmarks and comparisons to previous versions
- **Demo:** Step-by-step walkthrough demonstrating ACStor v2 configuration and usage
- **Local CSI Driver:** Updates to the storage interface driver to support new features
- **Operational Changes:** Reduced node minimums, no migration paths from v1, and zero-cost implications
- **Post-GA Features:** Future roadmap and general availability plans
