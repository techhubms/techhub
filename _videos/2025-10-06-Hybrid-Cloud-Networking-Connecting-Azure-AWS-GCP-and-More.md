# Hybrid Cloud Networking: Connecting Azure, AWS, GCP, and More

**Author:** John Savill's Technical Training

## Overview

This session explores how to build network connectivity between services hosted in Azure and other major cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Oracle Cloud (OCI). Key networking strategies and services are discussed, enabling hybrid and multi-cloud architectures.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Virtual Networks (VNets):** Foundational building blocks for networking in Azure; setup and configuration guidance.
- **Connecting Non-VNet Resources:** How to network resources outside the virtual network scope.
- **Inter-Cloud Networking:** Practical approaches to link networks between Azure, AWS, GCP, and Oracle.
- **Microsoft Global Network & Points of Presence (POPs):** Leveraging Microsoft's global backbone for optimized connectivity.
- **Internet and Private Connectivity:** Comparing and combining public internet traffic with private connections using solutions like Azure ExpressRoute, AWS Direct Connect, GCP Interconnect, and Oracle FastConnect.
- **Site-to-Site (S2S) VPNs:** Walkthroughs for configuring S2S VPN gateways across clouds.
- **Direct and Dedicated Connections:** Using dedicated circuits (like ExpressRoute and Direct Connect) for predictable latency and bandwidth.
- **Provider Cloud Exchanges:** Utilizing third-party services to route traffic between cloud environments securely.
- **Backup and Resilience:** Strategies for ensuring high availability and fallback connectivity, including S2S VPN as a backup to direct lines.
- **Oracle Interconnect for Azure:** Deep dive on how Azure and Oracle integrate to enable robust, low-latency connections.
- **Name Resolution:** DNS strategies for seamless cross-cloud service discovery.
- **Resilience Considerations:** Building for redundancy and fault tolerance across providers.

## Actionable Insights

- Evaluate the right connectivity solution (public internet, S2S VPN, ExpressRoute, Direct Connect, FastConnect) based on your latency, bandwidth, and security requirements.
- Architect for redundancy using multiple connectivity options (e.g., S2S VPN fallback to ExpressRoute).
- Consider cloud exchange providers for complex environments.
- Implement robust DNS strategies for reliable cross-cloud service resolution.
- Understand each major provider's connectivity offerings and how they map to Azure capabilities.
- Plan for failover and resilience in large-scale hybrid or multi-cloud workloads.
