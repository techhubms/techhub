# Translating Conversations Using Azure AI Foundry Translator API

This episode from Microsoft Developer introduces the Azure AI Foundry Translator API (Public Preview), a service designed to translate text with state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) and large language model (LLM) translation.

## Episode Overview

- **Service**: Azure AI Foundry Translator API (Public Preview)
- **Key Features**:
  - NMT for reliable, scalable machine translation
  - LLM-based translation for context-aware results
  - Support for translating user conversations
  - Accommodation for tone (formal/informal) and gender in outputs

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up Azure and Azure AI Foundry resources for translation tasks
- Difference between NMT and LLM translation
- When to use NMT vs. LLM for different translation needs
- How to implement translation features that account for tone and gender
- Combining multiple translation targets in complex scenarios

## Step-by-Step Guide
