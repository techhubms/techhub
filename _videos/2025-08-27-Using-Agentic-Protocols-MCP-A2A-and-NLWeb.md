# Using Agentic Protocols (MCP, A2A, and NLWeb)

This lesson, presented by Microsoft Developer, explores three major agentic protocols utilized in building AI agents on Microsoft platforms: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent to Agent (A2A), and NLWeb. The lesson is part of the comprehensive "AI Agents for Beginners" course, with additional resources and code samples available at [aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners).

## Course Resources

- **Course Material & Code Samples**: [aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners)
- **Community Discord for Q&A**: [aka.ms/ai-agents/discord](https://aka.ms/ai-agents/discord)

## Lesson Overview

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **Concepts**: Introduction to how MCP works as a protocol for providing and maintaining context for large language models, enabling smarter, context-aware responses.
- **Code Samples**: Demonstrates the practical implementation of MCP, including context injection and message handling within agent environments.

### 2. Agent to Agent (A2A)

- **Concepts**: Explains how AI agents can communicate with each other to coordinate actions, share state, and build collaborative AI applications.
- **Code Samples**: Shows how to set up A2A communication, define message formats, and establish handshake protocols between agents.

### 3. NLWeb

- **Concepts**: Introduces the NLWeb protocol, designed to enable natural language web interactions for AI agents, allowing them to interpret and act on web-based instructions.
