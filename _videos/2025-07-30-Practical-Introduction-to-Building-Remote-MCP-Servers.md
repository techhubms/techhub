title: "Practical Introduction to Building Remote MCP Servers"
description: "This session features a guided walkthrough of building remote servers that are compatible with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a Microsoft-driven agent protocol. The presenters provide insights from constructing the GitHub remote MCP server, followed by a live demonstration using the open-source MCP SDK. Attendees gain a practical blueprint for integrating MCP-aware agents, leveraging resources like the MCP curriculum, VS Code integration, and Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. The session targets developers looking to extend platform capabilities and incorporate MCP tools into custom workflows."

# Practical Introduction to Building Remote MCP Servers

In this session, Microsoft Developer’s Toby P. shares first-hand insights from developing GitHub’s remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The talk is followed by Joe Z. building a new remote MCP server live using the open-source MCP SDK.

### What You'll Learn

- The basics of MCP: what it is and how MCP-aware agents interact with platforms
- Lessons learned building GitHub’s remote MCP server
- Step-by-step guidance on creating your own server using the MCP SDK
- Integrating MCP tools with custom agents via the Foundry Agent Service
- Leveraging MCP features within Visual Studio Code

### Additional Resources

- [MCP Curricula](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners)
- [MCP Servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp)
- [Community Discord](https://aka.ms/azureaifoundry/discord)
- [Azure AI Foundry Agent Service Announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/announcing-model-context-protocol-support-preview-in-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service/)

### Next Steps

Participants leave with actionable instructions and architectural knowledge to implement and deploy their own remote MCP servers, supporting agent integration and Microsoft-based development workflows.
