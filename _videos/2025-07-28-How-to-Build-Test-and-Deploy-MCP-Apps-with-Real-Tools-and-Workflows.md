## Overview

This session by Microsoft Developer provides a comprehensive walkthrough for developers interested in building applications using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Viewers are guided through the practical steps of taking MCP concepts into real projects with hands-on tools and official SDKs.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Building MCP Applications**: Learn how to set up MCP apps using official SDKs in major languages such as Python, C#, Java, TypeScript, and JavaScript. The video demonstrates how to leverage language model integration to enhance application functionality.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Explore live debugging techniques with MCP Inspector. The debugger assists in identifying issues and fine-tuning applications in real time.
- **Deployment with Azure Functions**: The video walks through deploying MCP servers using Azure Functions, providing a scalable and efficient hosting solution within the Microsoft cloud ecosystem.
- **API Security with Microsoft Entra ID and API Management**: Security best practices are discussed, focusing on integrating Microsoft Entra ID for identity management and API Management for robust security controls and governance.

## Additional Resources

- [MCP for Beginners](https://aka.ms/MCP-for-Beginners): A resource for those new to Model Context Protocol.
- [MCP Dev Days Day 1](https://aka.ms/MCPDevDays-Day1) and [Day 2](https://aka.ms/MCPDevDays-Day2): Event recordings and resources.
- [Registration for MCP Dev Days](https://aka.ms/mcpdevdays): For continued learning and networking.

## Practical Benefits

- **Cross-language Development**: The official SDKs support major programming languages, expanding accessibility to a broader developer audience.
- **Real-time Debugging**: MCP Inspector provides immediate insight, enhancing developer productivity and application quality.
- **Secure Deployments**: Leveraging Azure Functions, Entra ID, and API Management ensures secure, reliable, and scalable MCP deployments.

## Conclusion
