# Get Data into Fabric Eventhouse with No-Code Ingestion Wizard

In this episode of **Data Exposed**, the Microsoft Developer team demonstrates the capabilities of the Get Data wizard in Microsoft Fabric Eventhouseâ€”a powerful, no-code solution for data ingestion and preparation.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Source Flexibility**: Ingest data from multiple sources, including:
  - **Azure Storage**
  - **Amazon S3**
  - **EventHub**
  - **Local files**
  - **OneLake**
  - **Eventstreams**
- **Continuous Ingestion**: Supports ongoing data updates for real-time analysis, ensuring that your Eventhouse remains current with incoming data.
- **Data Preview**: View the structure and sample content before full ingestion, minimizing errors and streamlining validation.
- **Schema Inference and Editing**:
  - Automatic detection of table schemas reduces manual configuration.
  - Easily rename columns, change data types, and apply transformations directly during the ingestion process.
- **Cleaner, Analysis-Ready Data**: The wizard streamlines data cleansing and structuring, making downstream analytics simpler and more reliable.

## Demonstration and Walkthrough

The video walks through the step-by-step process of using the Get Data wizard, including demos of continuous ingestion from Azure Storage to Eventhouse, schema editing, and data preview features.
