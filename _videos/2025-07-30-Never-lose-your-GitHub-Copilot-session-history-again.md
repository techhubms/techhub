## Never lose your GitHub Copilot session history again

**Author:** GitHub

### Overview

Maintaining a running changelog of development work is essential for tracking and transparency. This guide presents a clever method for having GitHub Copilot automatically keep an updated `changelog.md` file reflecting your progress—even before code is committed. By using a simple but effective prompt, developers can ensure that session history and interim changes are never lost.

### How It Works

By applying a tailored prompt in GitHub Copilot, you can instruct Copilot to generate and update a `changelog.md` as you work. This enables real-time documentation of your thought process, changes, and features, which is especially useful:

- For retrospective review of coding sessions
- As a workspace history backup before formal commits
- To improve project documentation practices

**Key benefits:**

- Never lose details on what was changed or why
- Retain incremental progress history
- Enhance collaboration with transparent interim updates

### Example Prompt

While the exact prompt isn’t provided in the excerpt, the described method involves asking Copilot to maintain and append to a `changelog.md` file during your workspace session. This can typically be initiated with a prompt such as:

> "Keep a running changelog.md of this project and append each meaningful change or reason as I work."

Developers can adapt and refine the prompt based on their needs and workflow preferences.
