# Build AI Agents for Fast, High-Volume Document Automation in Copilot Studio

**Presented by:** Elaiza Benitez with special guest, Ragavan Rajan (Solutions Architect, Downer New Zealand)

## Overview

Discover how Microsoft Copilot Studio, together with AI Builder, streamlines and automates the extraction of data from heavy vehicle permits. This solution replaces slow, manual document processes with smart, conversational workflows, drastically reducing processing time and errors while providing real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Key Topics

- **AI Builder Model Setup:**
  - Create and configure AI Builder models to read and extract important details from transport permit documents.
  - No coding is needed, empowering non-developers to build impactful AI solutions.

- **Developing and Deploying Agents in Copilot Studio:**
  - Use Copilot Studio to craft conversational AI agents that automate the start of document processing.
  - Deploy agents for bulk document processing, automate repetitive tasks, and deliver progress alerts to users.

- **Workflow Benefits:**
  - Processing time for permits drops dramatically—from days to minutes.
  - Reduces manual mistakes, offers real-time monitoring, and provides metrics to quantify efficiency gains.
