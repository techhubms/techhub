# A First Look at the New Copilot Agents Panel on GitHub

GitHub has released an upgraded integration of GitHub Copilot—now accessible directly from within github.com through a new agents panel. This browser-native setup gives Copilot immediate access to your repository, issues, and pull requests without requiring users to leave the web environment.

## Key Features

- **Native Browser Access**: Use GitHub Copilot directly on github.com via a dedicated agents panel.
- **Full Repository Context**: Copilot analyzes your codebase, issues, and pull requests to deliver more relevant, actionable suggestions.
- **Seamless Task Management**: Perform development tasks with AI assistance—like code suggestions, issue triage, or pull request reviews—directly inside the web interface.
- **Reduced Context Switching**: No need to juggle between desktop IDEs and browsers; work stays centralized on the GitHub site.

## How It Works

- Open any repository on github.com.
- The Copilot agents panel appears in the browser, providing context-aware AI-powered assistance.
- Run commands, get code suggestions, or ask questions about your code, issues, or pull requests—all within the same interface.

## Benefits for Developers

- Faster development cycles by minimizing workflow interruptions.
- Better context for Copilot-generated outputs, since the AI sees your repository’s current state and related discussions.
- Unified software development experience in a single web platform.
