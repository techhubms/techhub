# Authentic DevOps with AI Foundry and GitHub: Enhancing Security Automation

## Overview

This episode of **Sip and Sync with Azure** explores how integrating Azure AI Foundry agents with GitHub and GitHub Copilot can revolutionize DevOps and security workflows. Hosts Krystal Folkes and Katie Novotny, both part of Microsoft's Global Black Belt team, provide a practical walkthrough of utilizing these technologies for developer-led security automation.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Building Security Agents**: Demonstration on creating a security-focused agent leveraging Azure AI Foundry and MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform) tools.
- **Automation with GitHub**: How to connect the agent to GitHub’s advanced security advisories to automate vulnerability insights.
- **GitHub Copilot for Prompt Engineering**: Utilizing GitHub Copilot to improve and fine-tune prompts for agent instructions, making developer interaction more effective.
- **Secure Local Execution**: Running agents securely on a local machine using GitHub token authentication, managed identities, and Azure Key Vault integration for secrets.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Handling advanced DevOps scenarios through orchestration of multiple agents for planning, documentation, and security workflows.

## Demo Highlights

- **Connecting Azure AI Foundry Agents with GitHub**: Step-by-step setup and the technical approach to bring these platforms together.
- **Python Application Demo**: Showcasing code and SDK usage for building and deploying an AI-powered security agent.
- **Authorization with GitHub MCP Server**: Securely enabling the agent to access advanced security advisories for vulnerability management.
- **Viewing Security Insights**: Live demonstration of security advisories in action and how they inform DevOps workflows.

## Security and Best Practices

- **Leveraging Azure Key Vault**: Demonstrating secure integration for storing tokens and keys.
