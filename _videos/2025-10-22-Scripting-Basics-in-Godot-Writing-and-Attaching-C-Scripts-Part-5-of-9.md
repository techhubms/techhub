title: "Scripting Basics in Godot: Writing and Attaching C# Scripts (Part 5 of 9)"
description: "This episode from the Godot C# training series explores how to bring a player character to life through C# scripting in the Godot engine. The lesson covers input handling, smooth player movement, and rotation using physics-based techniques. Viewers learn the essentials of Godot's C# scripting architecture, from input mapping to lifecycle methods, debugging, and structuring logic for reusable code. By the end, viewers will have a working, responsive player controller and a challenge to implement interactive scene objects."

# Scripting Basics - Write C# Scripts and Attach Them to Nodes

## Introduction

Episode 5 of the Godot C# training series focuses on scripting fundamentals using C#, enabling you to control a player character with responsive movement and rotation in Godot.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Configuring Input Map:** Set up keyboard controls for flexible gameplay input.
- **Lifecycle Methods:** Understand methods like `_Ready`, `_Process`, and `_PhysicsProcess` in Godot's scripting pipeline.
- **Handling Input:** Use `_UnhandledInput` and `_UnhandledKeyInput` for robust input management.
- **Character Movement:** Implement physics-based logic using `CharacterBody3D` to create fluid, responsive character movement.
- **Smooth Rotation:** Apply `LerpAngle` for seamless and realistic player rotation.
- **Script Organization:** Leverage `Export` and `ExportGroup` to manage script variables in the Godot inspector for easy tweaking.
- **Debugging:** Identify and fix common issues encountered in Godot C# scripts.

## Practical Challenge

Create an interactive scene object—such as a spinning obstacle or a moving block—that responds to a key press (e.g., the Y key).

## Chapters Overview

- **Intro:** Making the player move
- **Setting Up Input Map:** Creating custom keyboard actions
- **Adding C# Script:** Integrating logic into the player
- **Physics-Based Movement:** Implementing character movement
- **Rotation:** Adding smooth rotation
- **Exporting Variables:** Adjusting values in Inspector
- **Challenge:** Interactive obstacle creation
- **Wrap-Up:** Preview of next debugging lesson
