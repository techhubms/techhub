# 7 Essential Git Concepts Every Beginner Needs to Know

GitHub's video is a starting point for anyone new to version control, offering a clear explanation of fundamental Git concepts and how they relate to collaborative development. The video covers:

## 1. Working Directory

- The local folder on your machine where files reside and are frequently edited.

## 2. Staging Area

- A space where you prepare changes before committing them, allowing you to control what will be included in your next snapshot.

## 3. Local Repository

- An independent copy of the project’s history stored locally on your computer.

## 4. Remote Repository

- The shared version hosted online (e.g., on GitHub), facilitating collaboration across teams and geographies.

## 5. Branches

- Enables parallel development by creating separate lines of work—for features, bug fixes, or experiments—without interfering with the main project.

## 6. Pull Requests

- Mechanism to propose, discuss, and review changes before merging them into main codebases, central to collaborative workflows.

## 7. Merging

- The process of integrating changes from different branches, ensuring that updates and features are consolidated.
