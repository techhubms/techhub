# Deploying and Comparing Models in Microsoft Foundry

**Author:** Microsoft Developer (April)

This session guides developers through the capabilities of the Microsoft Foundry portal for model management, including:

## 1. Introduction

- Quick overview of the Microsoft Foundry portal and its focus on AI model workflows.

## 2. Exploring Models

- Browse available models within the Foundry portal.
- Understand model capabilities and intended use cases.

## 3. Comparing Model Benchmarks

- Evaluate and contrast different models using built-in benchmarking tools.
- Learn how to interpret and leverage benchmark results for selecting the right model.

## 4. Deploying a Model

- Step-by-step demonstration on how to deploy a model to a production environment via the portal.
- Access deployment status and configuration information post-deployment.

## 5. Model Playground and Chat

- Use the interactive playground to chat with deployed models directly in the portal.
- Test model responses and performance before integrating into applications.

## 6. Transition to Code-First Experience

- Seamlessly shift from chatting and experimentation in Foundry to code development.
- Use the web-based Visual Studio Code editor to interact with, modify, and manage deployed models via code.

## 7. Resources and Community Links

- Try out Microsoft Foundry yourself: [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com)
- Learn more from Foundry’s Model and Tools announcements: [https://aka.ms/model-mondays](https://aka.ms/model-mondays)
- Join the discussion: [Discord](https://aka.ms/insideMF/discord) • [Forum](https://aka.ms/insideMF/forum)

**Key Takeaways:**

- Learn how to compare model performance using Foundry.
- Deploy models and view deployment status directly in the portal.
- Test models interactively and shift smoothly into a code-centric workflow with Visual Studio Code for further development.
