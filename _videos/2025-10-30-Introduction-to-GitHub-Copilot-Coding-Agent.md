# Introduction to GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

Damian Brady from Microsoft Developer outlines how the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent revolutionizes developer tasks within GitHub by moving beyond simple code completion. With this agent, developers can assign GitHub issues and Copilot can attempt to fix them by providing suggested solutions or implementing code changes directly.

## Key Features

- **Automated Issue Resolution**: Assign issues and let Copilot Coding Agent propose and even implement fixes.
- **Beyond Code Suggestions**: Unlike traditional Copilot functionality, Coding Agent engages with repository workflows, taking on tasks in a more autonomous fashion.
- **Integration with GitHub**: Seamless operational capability within project boards and CI/CD workflows.
- **Developer-Oriented AI Tooling**: Focuses on practical coding automation rather than general productivity features.
