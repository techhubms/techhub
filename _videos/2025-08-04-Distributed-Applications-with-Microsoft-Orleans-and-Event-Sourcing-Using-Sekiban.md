  - Designed for high developer productivity.
  - Integrates seamlessly with LLM agents for enhanced workflows in VS Code.
  - Active contributor community.
- **Integration and Productivity:**
  - How Sekiban makes it easier for developers to build and manage distributed systems with minimal overhead.
  - Practical demo of integration with language models and VS Code, improving application intelligence and developer experience.

## Intended Audience

- .NET developers interested in distributed application patterns
- Architects looking to implement event sourcing and CQRS
- Developers exploring productivity tools and frameworks for .NET
- Anyone curious about open-source .NET frameworks
