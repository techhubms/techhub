title: "Choosing Between MCP and A2A for AI Applications"
description: "This video by John Savill explores whether to use the Microsoft Cloud Platform (MCP), the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, or both when building AI and generative AI applications with large language models (LLMs). It discusses the differences between the platforms, practical applications, and integration strategies, helping developers and architects understand the best fit for their scenarios."

# Choosing Between MCP and A2A for AI Applications

In this session, John Savill provides a comprehensive discussion on when to use Microsoft's MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform), the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol, or a combination of both for building AI and generative AI applications leveraging LLMs.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to AI Applications**: Overview of the challenges and design considerations when building with LLMs and generative AI components.
- **What is MCP?**: Detailed segment on the Microsoft Cloud Platformâ€”its core features, where it excels, and scenarios it solves.
- **Understanding LLMs and MCP**: How MCP interacts with large language models in real-world deployments.
- **The Role of Agents and Agent Protocols**: Explanation of how agents interact, the need for orchestration, and the emergence of the A2A protocol.
- **A2A Protocol Overview**: Deep dive into the A2A protocol, including the structure and function of agent cards, task coordination, message passing, and artifact management between agents.
- **Combining MCP AND A2A**: When and why you might need both platforms, and the architectural considerations to keep in mind.
