description: "This video by John Savill offers a concise guide to how Azure availability zones (AZs) in a subscription map to the underlying datacenter sets and how those align with AZs in other subscriptions. It includes a walkthrough of a custom PowerShell script, explains the physical vs logical separation of AZs, and demonstrates practical techniques for assessing regional AZ alignment. Resources and further learning links are also provided."

# Understanding Azure Availability Zone Mappings for Subscriptions

In this video, **John Savill** provides a practical overview of how Azure Availability Zones (AZs) within a given subscription are mapped to the actual physical datacenters in a region and how this mapping may differ or align across different subscriptions. This guidance is essential for architects and engineers planning for redundancy, disaster recovery, and high availability in Azure.

## Topics Covered

- **AZ Refresher**: A brief overview of what Availability Zones are in Azure and why they matter for resiliency and planning (00:13).
- **AZ Alignment Between Subscriptions**: Explanation of how the logical representation of AZs in one subscription may map to different physical datacenters compared to another subscription, and why this is important (01:52).
- **Script Walkthrough**: Step-by-step walkthrough of the `Read-AzureAZs.ps1` PowerShell script, which can be used to analyze AZ mappings within your subscription (04:02).
- **Demo**: Live demonstration of using the script to examine AZ mapping in the `eastus` and `westus2` Azure regions (08:20).

## Script Usage Example

```powershell
. .\Read-AzureAZs.ps1 read-azureazs eastus, westus2
```

This PowerShell script, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnthebrit/RandomStuff/blob/master/AzureAZCheck/Read-AzureAZs.ps1), allows users to inspect how their subscription's AZs are mapped and aligned.
