# Building Remote MCP Servers with .NET and Azure

This session demonstrates how AI assistants can utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect with external tools and data sources by building remote MCP servers with .NET and Azure. The approach enhances automation, improves scalability, and allows flexible hosting—making it suitable for both local prototypes and cloud deployments.

## Key Benefits of Remote MCP Servers

- **Automation**: Seamless integration with external systems and processes.
- **Collaboration**: Shared access to context-aware servers for teams and applications.
- **Scalability**: Azure hosting allows dynamic scaling as workloads grow.
- **Flexible Hosting**: Choose between local and cloud-based deployments.

- **.NET MAUI 10**: Build cross-platform, beautiful apps – [Learn more](https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025)
- **C# 14 and F# 10**: More expressive, productive, and functional languages – [C#](https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025), [F#](https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement)
- **Visual Studio 2026**: Faster, smarter IDE – [Learn more](https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement)
- **Azure**: Scalable, reliable cloud platform for hosting MCP servers

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**:
    - Install the latest version of .NET
    - Use Visual Studio 2026 for streamlined workflows
2. **Build your MCP server**:
    - Leverage ASP.NET Core 10 for secure APIs
    - Integrate MCP libraries and protocols
3. **Experiment locally**:
    - Test server functionality before cloud deployment
4. **Deploy to Azure**:
    - Utilize .NET Aspire 13 orchestration for robust cloud-native hosting
    - Monitor, scale, and manage instances via Azure Portal
