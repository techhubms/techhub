# Browser Automation Tool (Preview) in Azure AI Foundry

In this video, April from Microsoft Developer demonstrates the Browser Automation Tool (Preview) integrated into Azure AI Foundry. The tool enables users to automate complex browser tasks by simply providing natural language instructions to an agent powered by Azure's AI capabilities.

## Key Highlights

- **Natural Language Task Automation**: Submit requests in plain English and an agent interprets and executes browser tasks accordingly.
- **Playwright Workspaces Integration**: Sessions are powered by Playwright Workspaces, running directly within your Azure subscription for enhanced security and isolation.
- **Automated Page Interaction**: The AI model analyzes web page structures, decides actions, and executes them step-by-step, dynamically adapting if the page changes during the process.
- **Practical Walkthrough**:
  1. **Create Playwright Workspace Resource**: Learn how to set up the foundational environment for browser automation.
  2. **Connect Playwright Workspace in Foundry**: Integrate your resource with Azure AI Foundry to start developing automation flows.
  3. **Run Sample Code in VS Code**: See an example in Visual Studio Code demonstrating how automation is triggered and monitored across your session.
- **Security and Isolation**: Each browser automation session runs in its own isolated workspace to protect data and ensure secure operations.
