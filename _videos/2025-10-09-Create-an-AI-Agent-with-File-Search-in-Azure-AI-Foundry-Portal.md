# Create an AI Agent with File Search in Azure AI Foundry (Portal)

**Presented by: Microsoft Developer**

This guide provides a practical, no-code introduction to building and testing AI Agents using the File Search tool inside Azure AI Foundry.

## Overview

Learn how to:

- Create an AI agent through the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Upload and index files for the agent to search
- Interact with your agent in the Playground
- Add evaluators and access generated code (optional)

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### 1. Create an Agent

Start by signing into the Azure AI Foundry portal at [https://ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com). Use the portal workflow to set up a new agent instance.

### 2. Chat with the Agent in the Playground

After creation, test the agent by chatting with it in the built-in Playground, verifying it responds as expected based on its current capabilities.

### 3. Add Files with File Search

Use the File Search tool to upload relevant documents. These files will be indexed, allowing the agent to search and retrieve information when answering queries.

- Example resource: Download the sample "Surfer Recommendations" file [here](https://aka.ms/insideAIF/code).

### 4. View Conversation Thread

Observe and review past chats and the agent's responses in the thread view to understand how your agent leverages file content.

### 5. Add Additional Evaluators (Optional)

Extend your agent's abilities by incorporating additional evaluators through the portal's configuration options.

### 6. Get the Code (Optional)

The portal optionally provides access to the underlying code for the created agent, enabling further customization.

### 7. Delete the Agent (Cleanup)

Remove agents you no longer need to keep your workspace organized.
