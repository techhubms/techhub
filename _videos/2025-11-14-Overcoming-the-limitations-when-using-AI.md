# Overcoming the Limitations When Using AI

**Speaker:** Michael Washington  
**Event:** .NET Conf 2025

Artificial intelligence (AI) offers many possibilities but is inherently imprecise, which can create obstacles during integration into real-world applications. In this session, Michael Washington discusses the main practical challenges encountered when working with AI and shares proven strategies and techniques to address them.

## Key Topics

- **AI's Inherent Imprecision:** Understanding the unpredictable nature of AI and the risks it presents for application developers.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Approaches and best practices to decrease the impact of AI's inconsistencies.
- **Proven Techniques:** Real–world implementation advice drawn from working projects.
- **Open-Source Applications:**
  - [AIStoryBuildeers.com](https://AIStoryBuildeers.com)
  - [BlazorData.net](https://BlazorData.net)

These examples illustrate effective patterns and practical engineering used to harness AI's strengths in production scenarios.
