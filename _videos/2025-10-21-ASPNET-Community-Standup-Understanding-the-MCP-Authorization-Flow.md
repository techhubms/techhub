# ASP.NET Community Standup: The MCP Authorization Flow

**Presenters:** Daniel Roth, Mike Kistler  
**Date/Spec:** Based on the 2025-06-18 MCP specification  

## Overview

This Community Standup session provides a practical walkthrough of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) authorization process, primarily for .NET and ASP.NET Core developers.

### What You'll Learn

- How the MCP authorization flow operates according to the latest specification
- Steps for authorizing requests to a GitHub MCP server
- Hands-on demos with real requests, performed from a polyglot notebook
- Insights into adapting your .NET/ASP.NET Core solutions for secure authorization

## Agenda

1. **Introduction to MCP and Authorization Principles**
2. **Explaining the 2025-06-18 MCP Spec Updates**
3. **Live Demonstration: Auth Requests via Polyglot Notebook**
4. **Integrating Secure Flows in ASP.NET Core**
5. **Q&A from the Developer Community**

## Key Takeaways

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open specification that streamlines secure communication and authorization between services.
- The latest 2025-06-18 spec introduces updated authorization steps for improved security and interoperability.
- Practical examples are shown making live authorization requests to GitHub MCP serversâ€”great reference material for developers working with .NET and security protocols.
- The session is ideal for developers who want to understand low-level protocol flows and apply robust security in their web/API infrastructure.
