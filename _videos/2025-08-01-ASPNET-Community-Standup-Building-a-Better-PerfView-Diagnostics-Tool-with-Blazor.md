## ASP.NET Community Standup: Building a Better PerfView with Blazor

**Featured Presenters:** Daniel Roth, Noah Falk, Grégoire Verdier  
**Hosted by:** dotnet

---

### Overview

This ASP.NET Community Standup explores the creation and development of the .NET Events Viewer, a community-driven diagnostic tool built with Blazor. Inspired by a real-world thread pool issue, the tool aims to enhance the developer experience for .NET performance investigations by offering a modern diagnostics interface.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Origin Story:** The .NET Events Viewer was conceived as a response to practical challenges in diagnosing thread pool issues within .NET applications. The creators sought a more accessible, web-based alternative to existing tools such as PerfView.
- **Blazor Implementation:** Utilizing Blazor, the tool leverages .NET technology to deliver interactive diagnostics directly in the browser, bringing familiar web UI paradigms to the realm of low-level performance analysis.
- **Live Demonstration:** Grégoire Verdier and .NET diagnostics engineer Noah Falk demo the tool, showcasing features relevant to .NET developers looking to diagnose and visualize application performance issues.
- **Lessons from Open Source:** The presenters reflect on their experiences contributing to .NET and building developer tools in open-source environments. Discussion includes the technical and non-technical aspects of open-source collaboration and how community-driven innovation benefits the entire ecosystem.

### Impact and Collaboration

- The development journey highlights how individual real-world needs fuel tool creation within the .NET community.
- Collaboration between contributors (including Microsoft engineers and community members) demonstrates the importance of open-source efforts in the evolution of developer tooling and diagnostics.
- The session underscores how new tools can emerge when the community is empowered to address gaps and iterate rapidly on solutions.

### Community and Further Information

- **Resource Links:** A curated list of links mentioned in the session is available at [https://www.theurlist.com/aspnet-standup-20250805](https://www.theurlist.com/aspnet-standup-20250805).
- **Hashtags and Topics:** Focus includes ASP.NET Core, Blazor, diagnostics, open-source developer tools, and the broader .NET open-source ecosystem.

### Takeaways

- The .NET Events Viewer project exemplifies how community-driven development within the .NET ecosystem leads to more accessible, robust developer tooling.
- Leveraging Blazor for diagnostics tools bridges the gap between traditional desktop performance analysis and modern web-based workflows.
- Open-source collaboration not only accelerates innovation but also ensures tools remain relevant to real-world developer needs.

For further discussion and participation, developers are encouraged to engage with the community and explore contributing to projects like the .NET Events Viewer.
