# Unlock Your First AI Solution with Microsoft Azure and UnifyCloud

**Session: OD1210 | Speakers: Vivek Bhatnagar, Joshua Huang | Microsoft Ignite 2025**

For small and medium businesses (SMBs), integrating AI is now a priority rather than a distant aspiration. This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 provides two straightforward paths to adopt AI innovations using Azure:

## Key Approaches

1. **Building an AI Solution with Foundry Templates**  
   - Learn to create a functional AI solution in minutes using Azure Foundry Templates.
   - Includes a practical demo starting with cloning a GitHub repository into Azure Cloud Shell.
   - Resource management walkthrough, including cleaning up resources efficiently with the `azd down` command.

2. **Deploying Marketplace AI Solutions**  
   - Step-by-step demonstration deploying 'Cloud Atlas' via the Microsoft Marketplace.
   - Overview of configuring and launching pre-built AI solutions from trusted partners.

## Demonstrations

- **Cloning GitHub Repository into Azure Cloud Shell**: Shows how to set up project scaffolding and get started quickly.
- **Resource Cleanup with 'azd down'**: Best practices for managing Azure resources post-deployment.
- **Accessing and Deploying Cloud Atlas**: Finds, configures, and deploys a trusted AI solution from the Microsoft Marketplace.
- **Exploring AI Guardian Dashboard**: Visualizes AI deployment health and manages vulnerability fixes.
- **AI Factory Deployment Generation**: Uses the AI Factory to generate custom deployment assets and configurations for operational efficiency.

## Session Value

Attendees gain:

- Direct, actionable demos for two entry-level AI adoption strategies
- Exposure to both build-from-scratch and buy-from-marketplace options
- Practical insights leveraged for SMBs looking for rapid results
- Resources for ongoing learning via Ignite's on-demand content
