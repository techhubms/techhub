# Interactions in Godot C#: Handling Player Input with Signals and Collision Detection

**Episode 8 – Godot C# Training Series**

In this hands-on episode, the focus is on making your Godot game world feel alive through interactive systems. Using Godot’s signal system and Area3D nodes, you will learn how to:

## Key Topics Covered

- **Detect Player Proximity:**
  - Use Area3D nodes to sense when players enter specific spaces.
- **Set Up Collision Layers and Masks:**
  - Configure collision shapes, layers, and masks to manage how objects and the player interact.
- **Connect Built-In Signals:**
  - Hook up signals like `body_entered` and `body_exited` to trigger events in your C# scripts.
- **Emit Custom Signals:**
  - Build your own signals for situations like collecting an item or interacting with a game station.
- **Communicate Between Game Systems:**
  - Use signals to pass information between inventory, UI, and other game mechanics.

## Walkthrough: Building an Interactive “Chicken Station”

- Add a Chicken Station object to your scene.
- Detect when the player approaches using Area3D.
- Set up collision detection for the interaction zone.
- Connect player input (e.g., pressing 'E') to trigger collection events.
- Emit custom signals to notify the inventory and UI systems.
- Prepare these systems for future features like crafting.

## Challenge

Create a "Milk Station" object, similar to the Chicken Station. When the player presses 'E', they collect milk, which prepares the ground for upcoming crafting mechanics.
