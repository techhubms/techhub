# Agent Framework: Building Blocks for the Next Generation of AI Agents

This video session from Microsoft Developer introduces the Agent Framework, an open source project that brings together Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, offering developers a unified pro-code SDK for designing and deploying multi-agent AI systems.

## Overview

- **Open Source and Interoperability**: The framework is designed for openness, scalability, and community contribution, converging AI agent development resources into a single platform.
- **Pro-Code SDK**: Agent Framework enables direct programming and orchestration of agents across clouds, tools, and models, aligning with open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Migration Pathways**: Guidance is provided for migrating from previous Microsoft AI initiatives—Semantic Kernel and AutoGen—to the new framework.
- **Enterprise Ready**: Features include robust memory and conversation state management, with demonstrations of enterprise-grade agentic AI workflows.
- **OSS Community Focus**: The session encourages developers to get involved in the OSS project, emphasizing contribution and support for community-driven standards.
