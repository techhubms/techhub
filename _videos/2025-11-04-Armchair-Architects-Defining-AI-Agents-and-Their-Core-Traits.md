## Episode Overview

This opening episode explores AI agents, breaking down what distinguishes them from chatbots and outlining their increasing role in cloud solution architecture. The discussion defines essential agent characteristics, clarifies the relationship between agents and large language models (LLMs), and dives into architectural layers and anomaly handling.

## Key Topics

- **AI Agents vs Chatbots:** Clear definitions, use cases, and differences.
- **Architectural Layers:** Describes how agents fit within broader system designs.
- **LLM Requirements:** Discusses when agents need LLMs and when they don't.
- **Agent Capabilities:** Empowerment to act, handling anomalies, and decision-making.
- **Integration Points:** Where agents augment or plug into cloud-based architectures.
