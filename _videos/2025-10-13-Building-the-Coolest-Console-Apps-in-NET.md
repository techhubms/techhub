# Building the Coolest Console Apps in .NET

**Presented by Nick Chapsas**

Nick Chapsas walks through the process of creating console applications in .NET using the RazorConsole library. This approach utilizes Razor Pages to construct rich console interfaces, making your command-line tools much more interactive and visually appealing.

## RazorConsole Overview

- **RazorConsole** enables developers to use familiar Razor Pages for building console UIs.
- This library transforms razor markup into styled console output, allowing for creative layouts and UI components within .NET console apps.

## Getting Started with RazorConsole

1. Add RazorConsole to your .NET project (details available on [RazorConsole GitHub](https://github.com/LittleLittleCloud/RazorConsole)).
2. Use Razor syntax to define your console layout and components.
3. Run your console app and see Razor DSL render directly in the terminal.
