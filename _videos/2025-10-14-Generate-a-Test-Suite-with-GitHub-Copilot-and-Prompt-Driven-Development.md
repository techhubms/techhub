# Generate a Test Suite with GitHub Copilot and Prompt-Driven Development

**Featuring:** Liam Hampton  
**Presented by:** Visual Studio Code Team

This tutorial video showcases how to rapidly create comprehensive test suites using GitHub Copilot and prompt-driven development (PDD) techniques within Visual Studio Code. The session includes:

## Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Prompt-Driven Development (PDD):**
  - Understand how prompt-driven techniques streamline software testing in VS Code.

- **App Overview:**
  - Overview of the application under test and its main functionality.

- **Creating Test Files with Copilot:**
  - Step-by-step process to scaffold new test files using natural language prompts in the VS Code editor.

- **Writing Various Types of Tests:**
  - Demonstrates writing end-to-end tests, unit tests, and integration tests.
  - Focus on API integration and edge case coverage using Copilot-assisted suggestions.
  - Mocking strategies for complex dependencies.

- **Assembling the Test Suite:**
  - Combines individual tests into a cohesive suite.
  - Shows practical tips for organizing and maintaining readable test code.

- **Running and Validating Tests:**
  - Executes the test suite inside VS Code and reviews test results.
