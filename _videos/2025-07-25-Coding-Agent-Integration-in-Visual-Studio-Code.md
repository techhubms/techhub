# Coding Agent Integration in Visual Studio Code

Explore how GitHub Copilot's autonomous coding agent can boost your productivity directly from Visual Studio Code. In this video, you'll learn about:

## Overview

- **Copilot Coding Agent**: An autonomous AI tool that works in the background to handle development tasks.
- **Integration in VS Code**: Use the GitHub Pull Requests extension to access coding agent features seamlessly in your editor.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Prerequisites**: Understand what's required to enable the coding agent in VS Code.
2. **App Overview**: See the end-to-end experience of Copilot in action.
3. **Assigning Issues**: Learn to delegate tasks by assigning GitHub issues directly to Copilot.
4. **Active Pull Requests**: Manage pull requests with the #activePullRequest feature.
5. **Iterate on Changes**: Use the agent to propose, refine, and test code iterations.
6. **Hands-Free Delegation**: Let Copilot handle selected coding tasks while you focus elsewhere.
