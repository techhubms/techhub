# Semantic Kernel Plugin Integration with MCP Server

In this tutorial, you will learn how to connect intelligent plugins with AI agents powered by Microsoft Cloud Platform (MCP) using Semantic Kernel. This is a valuable guide for developers aiming to build sophisticated, AI-driven applications with Microsoft technologies.

## What You'll Learn

- **Setting up the MCP Server**: Step-by-step instructions on configuring your MCP environment for AI development.
- **Creating and Registering a Semantic Kernel Plugin**: Guidance on designing and implementing plugins for Semantic Kernel and how to register them with MCP.
- **Invoking the Plugin via MCP**: Learn how to trigger your Semantic Kernel plugins through MCP, enabling seamless AI agent workflow integration.
- **Real-time Demo**: The video includes a hands-on demonstration, showing the practical application of the integration from end-to-end.

## Technologies Used

- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft's open-source framework for integrating AI and plugins
- **MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform)**: The backbone for AI agent management and orchestration
- **.NET / C#**: Used to develop and integrate custom plugins
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio**: Underlying platform for extending AI agent capabilities

## Key Steps

1. **MCP Server Setup**  
   Configure and initialize your MCP server to prepare it for plugin integration.
2. **Plugin Creation**  
   Develop a Semantic Kernel plugin with .NET, focusing on AI agent utility and extensibility.
3. **Register Plugin with MCP**  
   Use MCP tools to register your Semantic Kernel plugin so it can be discovered and invoked.
4. **Invoke and Test**  
   Demonstrate plugin invocation in real time, showing how AI agents leverage your extension.
