# Rx.NET Status and Plans

Rx.NET remains a widely used library with millions of monthly downloads, empowering reactive programming throughout the .NET ecosystem. In this session, the "dotnet" team discusses both ongoing development efforts and the roadmap for future Rx.NET versions.

## Current Adoption

- Rx.NET continues to be a core component for dealing with asynchronous and event-driven applications.
- Millions of downloads indicate strong and active community usage within .NET projects.

## Work In Progress

- Recent updates focus on reliability, performance improvements, and modernizing Rx.NET to align with evolving .NET standards.
- Improvements in compatibility and support for new .NET releases.
- Bug fixes and stabilization remain a continual priority based on user feedback and real-world use.

## Future Roadmap

- Plans include introducing new features, adapting Rx.NET for upcoming .NET versions, and potentially supporting new application scenarios.
- Strong emphasis on maintaining Rx.NET's relevance for developers building complex event-stream-based applications.
- Community involvement and contributions continue to guide library direction.

## Getting Involved

- Developers can participate via GitHub and shape Rx.NET's evolution.
- Stay informed on future sessions and updates through the official .NET Conf event and the Rx.NET community.
