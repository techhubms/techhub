# Rapid Database Integration in VS Code with Microsoft Learn MCP Server and GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

Switching between multiple documentation browser tabs and coding environments can slow down development. In this session, Chris Noring demonstrates how to use the Microsoft Learn MCP server directly within Visual Studio Code, alongside GitHub Copilot, to quickly add database support to applications.

## Why Use Microsoft Learn MCP Server?

- **Up-to-date Documentation**: Integrates official Microsoft Docs directly into your IDE
- **Less Context Switching**: Reduces disruption by keeping documentation close to your code
- **VS Code Integration**: Seamlessly accessible in your development environment

## Using GitHub Copilot

- **AI Assistance**: Copilot can suggest code for database integration and deployment scripts in real time
- **Accelerated Development**: Great for adding common resources like Postgres in minutes

## Step-by-Step Demo

### Setting Up MCP Server in VS Code

1. **Install MCP Extension** from the VS Code marketplace
2. **Authenticate** any necessary Microsoft account or permissions
3. **Access Microsoft Docs** directly from your editor side pane

### Adding a Postgres Database

1. Create a new application scaffold (language/stack is user’s choice)
2. Use Copilot in VS Code to request boilerplate code for Postgres database connection and schema
3. Leverage the MCP server to reference accurate code snippets and configuration examples
4. Generate deployment scripts with Copilot’s assistance
5. Verify and test integration directly in the IDE

## Conclusion

By combining the MCP server in VS Code and GitHub Copilot, developers can:

- Quickly access up-to-date, contextual documentation
- Use AI-powered code suggestions to automate repetitive or complex steps
- Add databases and other infrastructure in a fraction of the time
