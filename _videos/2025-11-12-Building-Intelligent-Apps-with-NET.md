# Building Intelligent Apps with .NET

Presented by dotnet, this session focuses on empowering developers to build smarter applications using the latest AI capabilities within the .NET ecosystem.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Unified AI Abstractions**: Learn how Microsoft.Extensions.AI provides a consistent way to integrate various AI features into .NET applications.
- **Large Language Model Integration**: Practical approaches to embedding LLMs for tasks like summarization and classification.
- **Semantic Search**: Implement semantic search to enhance information retrieval in your apps.
- **Intelligent Features**: Add summarization, classification, and AI-powered assistants directly to .NET solutions.
- **Cloud and Local Model Support**: Patterns for using both cloud-hosted and on-premises AI models.

## Modern .NET Platforms and Tools

- **.NET 10**: The most intelligent and unified .NET version yet ([.NET 10 Announcement](https://aka.ms/dotnet10/))
- **.NET Aspire 13**: Simplified orchestration for cloud-native applications ([Aspire 13](https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement))
- **ASP.NET Core 10**: Modern, secure, full-stack web development ([ASP.NET Core 10](https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025))
- **.NET MAUI 10**: Cross-platform UI development ([.NET MAUI 10](https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025))
- **C# 14** and **F# 10**: Advances in language productivity and safety ([C# 14](https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025), [F# 10](https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement))
- **Visual Studio 2026**: Enhanced development environment ([Visual Studio 2026](https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement))
