# Blueprint for Building the SOC of the Future

## Session Overview

This intermediate session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 dives into the components and strategies for establishing a next-generation Security Operations Center (SOC) built around Microsoft Sentinel and Defender platforms. Attendees will see practical designs and workflows that bring autonomy, adaptability, and integration to security teams.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Mapping Organizational Complexity and Attacker Awareness**
  - Understand how complex environments challenge traditional SOC approaches.
- **Building the Organizational Security Graph**
  - Use graph-powered reasoning to visualize identity relationships and attack surfaces.
- **Using Agents and Graphs to Identify Attack Paths**
  - Discover techniques for tracing potential attacker trajectories through your environment.
- **Hunting and Anomaly Detection with Graph-Based Analysis**
  - Implement proactive hunting and detect anomalous behavior using graphs.
- **Unified Identity Inventory**
  - Centralize identities to improve correlation and detection.
- **Real-time Attack Detection and Automated Response**
  - Build workflows for immediate threat detection and automated incident response.
- **Assistive AI Agents: Copilot and Collaborative Coding**
  - Leverage AI agents and Copilot for improved analyst efficiency and collaboration.
- **AI in Enrichment, Automation, and Response Workflows**
  - Use AI to enhance context, automate repetitive tasks, and drive faster decisions.
- **Key Lessons Learned**
  - Speed, continuous AI improvement, and fostering industry collaboration are highlighted as critical success factors.
