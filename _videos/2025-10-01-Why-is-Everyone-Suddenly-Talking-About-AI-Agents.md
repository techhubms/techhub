# Why is Everyone Suddenly Talking About AI Agents?

In this short video, John Maeda addresses the shift in conversation from AI models to AI agents, providing context for developers interested in the latest AI trends.

## Key Points

- **Industry Trend**: The focus is moving beyond building and deploying AI models to creating AI agents that can make decisions, take actions, and interact with users or systems autonomously.
- **Lower Model Costs**: As costs associated with running AI models decrease, it becomes feasible for more ambitious agent-based applications to be developed and deployed at scale.
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Microsoftâ€™s Azure AI Foundry is highlighted as a platform enabling the creation and deployment of these next-generation AI agents, providing developers with tools to streamline and support agent development workflows.

## Developer Takeaways

- Understanding AI agents and their difference from traditional models can help developers adapt to evolving technology landscapes.
- Azure's ecosystem is expanding to support the agent paradigm, and knowing the available tools and services will benefit those working on modern AI projects.
