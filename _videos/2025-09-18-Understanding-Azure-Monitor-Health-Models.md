# What are Azure Monitor Health Models?

If you’re overwhelmed by the volume of logs, alerts, and metrics flooding into your Azure environment, Azure Monitor Health Models offer a practical solution. In this video, Martin Simecek explains how Health Models in Azure Monitor can help developers and IT professionals:

- **Aggregate complex signals**: Instead of responding to endless alerts and disconnected logs, Health Models synthesize data into a single, cohesive health signal for your monitored resources.
- **Prioritize what matters**: By modeling resource health, you can focus response efforts on the most critical issues—cutting down noise and making incident management simpler.
- **Streamline observability**: Health Models provide a layer of abstraction above raw metrics and logs, letting you interpret system states more efficiently while still retaining granularity when needed.
