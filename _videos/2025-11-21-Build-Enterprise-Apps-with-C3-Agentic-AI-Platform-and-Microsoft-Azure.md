description: "This session, led by Adrian Rami at C3 AI during Microsoft Ignite 2025, demonstrates how to rapidly create enterprise AI apps on the C3 Agentic AI Platform, which is built on Microsoft Azure and integrates with Microsoft Fabric. The demo covers both low-code (Application Canvas) and full-code (Visual Studio Code) approaches, showcasing the full lifecycle: defining goals in natural language, instant app generation, code refinement, secure deployment, workflow building, agent integration, dashboard creation, and robust governance with versioning and observability. The presentation highlights how Microsoft technologies underpin the platform’s unified data architecture, while also touching on integrated agent builders and Copilot-style collaboration."

# Build Enterprise Apps with C3 Agentic AI Platform and Microsoft Azure

**Speaker:** Adrian Rami, GVP Products and Engineering at C3 AI  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025

This session provides a comprehensive demonstration on using the C3 Agentic AI Platform—built on Microsoft Azure and leveraging Microsoft Fabric’s unified data layer—to accelerate enterprise AI application development.

## Key Topics Covered

- **End-to-End App Development:**
  - Define business goals in natural language.
  - Instantly generate applications using low-code (Application Canvas) or write full code in Visual Studio Code.
  - Refine, customize, and extend generated apps with code.
  - Securely deploy to enterprise environments.

- **Platform Capabilities:**
  - Build advanced workflows and agents with built-in tools.
  - Integrate dashboards and connect to diverse data sources.
  - Ensure secure, governed deployment with features like versioning and observability.

- **Demonstration Highlights:**
  - Iterative building of applications by AI agents using stored knowledge.
  - Example: Monitoring incidents across distributed assets.
  - Modular workflow construction with minimal effort and small teams.

- **Integration with Microsoft Technologies:**
  - The C3 Agentic AI Platform is powered by Azure, offering scale and unified access to enterprise data via Microsoft Fabric.
  - The platform uses both natural language input and coding environments (VS Code) to support makers and developers.
  - Collaboration features include agent-based builders and Copilot-style support.

## Takeaways

- Accelerate enterprise AI app development with a unified, governed, and observable platform.
- Combine no-code, low-code, and pro-code workflows for maximum flexibility.
- Leverage Microsoft Azure and Fabric for scalable, secure application infrastructure.
