## Overview

**MCP Dev Days: Day 2 - Builders**, presented by Microsoft Developer, is the second session in a virtual event series focused on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP serves as a standard connecting AI models with the necessary tools and infrastructure.

---

## Agenda Highlights

- **Deep Dive into Implementation:** Day 2 is tailored for builders seeking practical insights on leveraging MCP.
- **Building MCP Servers:** Guidance on constructing MCP servers and integrating them into agent-based workflows.
- **Prompt-driven Development:** Exploration of prompt engineering and its significance in building effective AI solutions using MCP.
- **Security Best Practices:** Discussion of core principles and actionable frameworks to ensure the security of MCP-enabled solutions.
- **Scalable and Secure Servers:** Step-by-step instructions to use tools and services—such as Azure Functions, Azure Container Apps (ACA), and API Management—to create robust, enterprise-ready infrastructures.
