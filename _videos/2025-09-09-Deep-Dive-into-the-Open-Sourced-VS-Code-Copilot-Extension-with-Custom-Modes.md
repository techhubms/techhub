# Deep Dive into the Open-Sourced VS Code Copilot Extension with Custom Modes

## Episode Overview

Join Burke Holland from the Visual Studio Advocacy Team for a detailed exploration of the open-sourced VS Code Copilot Extension. This session reveals how developers can take control of the Copilot AI experience directly in Visual Studio Code by leveraging Custom Modes and community-driven enhancements.

## Key Highlights

- **Open Sourcing the Extension**: The VS Code Copilot Extension is now open source. Developers can view and contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat).
- **Copilot Custom Modes**: Learn to implement Custom Modes in Copilot, allowing you to tailor AI model behavior, optimize output quality, and control costs when using Copilot chat features. [Learn more](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-chat-modes).
- **Introducing Beast Mode**: The new "Beast Mode" chat extension, now integrated into VS Code Insiders, gives you powerful new options for prompt engineering and boosting productivity. Details and the 3.1 update are at [Burke's blog](https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/beast-mode-3-1/) and [Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/burkeholland/88af0249c4b6aff3820bf37898c8bacf/raw/f2bf4380b2dd886f1344544f8125c5ea10854a9c/beastmode3.1.chatmode.md).
- **Prompting Guides**: Advanced users can improve prompt engineering skills with official guidance for [GPT-4.1](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide) and [GPT-5](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt-5/gpt-5_prompting_guide).
