description: "This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 delves into the critical role of DNS within a Zero Trust security architecture. Participants learn how DNS monitoring and enforcement contributes to containment strategies, granular access control, and protection against network threats such as data exfiltration and DNS tunneling on Windows 11 devices. Topics include consistent security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, limitations of traditional security models, device-level DNS enforcement, and operational implementation details of Zero Trust DNS (ZT-DNS) within Microsoft technologies."

# DNS as a Foundational Element in Zero Trust Security on Windows 11

DNS plays an essential role in implementing Zero Trust security strategies by enforcing granular access controls and minimizing network exposure. With over 63% of organizations adopting Zero Trust, limiting resource access has become industry best practice.

### Key Topics Covered

- Need for consistent security across hybrid, multi-cloud, and on-premises environments
- Limitations of traditional react-detect-respond security models
- 'Assume Breach' mindset and containment strategies
- Continuous monitoring and network segmentation
- Techniques for detecting data exfiltration, DNS tunneling, and zero-day attacks
- Importance of continuous DNS monitoring for trust and security
- Device-level DNS enforcement for Windows Servers and Windows 11 endpoints
- Operational ZT-DNS implementation flow

### DNS in Zero Trust

DNS monitoring and enforcement help reduce the attack surface by controlling which resources are accessible. DNS tunneling detection and containment curtail unauthorized data movement. Windows 11 leverages device-level ZT-DNS controls, integrating Microsoft's security stack for defense-in-depth.

#### Operational Example of ZT-DNS Implementation

- Enforces granular access based on device identity and policy
- Segments network traffic to minimize risk exposure
- Supports continuous auditing and alerts for suspicious DNS activities

### Community Engagement

 Microsoft collaborates with the Infoblox community to advance Zero Trust DNS practices and share operational insights with practitioners.

DNS protection is a core pillar for Zero Trust security, especially in hybrid or multi-cloud deployments. Practitioners should assess their networks for limitations with traditional security models and prioritize continuous monitoring, segmentation, and device-level controls built into Microsoft platforms.
