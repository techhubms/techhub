# Building a Resilience Coach with AI on Cozy AI Kitchen

## Overview

Join host John Maeda as he combines psychology and AI engineering to guide you through building a personalized AI coach for resilience. The episode covers
psychological theories, AI concepts, and practical codingâ€”including deployment using Visual Studio Code and Python.

## Key Takeaways

- Understand psychological models that explain how people respond to change (Kubler-Ross curve, Grit theory, positive psychology)
- Learn how to apply these models to AI coaching agents
- Explore context engineering techniques to improve agent responses
- See a step-by-step walkthrough of deploying your own agent in code
- Access demo resources and repositories for hands-on practice

## Episode Chapters

1. **Responding to Change**: Assessing first reactions and emotional adaptation
2. **Resilience Coach Overview**: Introducing the project scope and goals
3. **Core Psychological Models**: Kubler-Ross curve, Angela Duckworth's Grit, Seligman's positive psychology applied to AI agents
4. **Building the Agent**: Agent development workflow, infusing expert knowledge
5. **Context Engineering**: Techniques to tailor agent responses
6. **Technical Deployment**:
    - Setting up VS Code
    - Implementing in Python
    - Running and testing the AI agent
7. **Live Demo**: Real-time coaching via the agent
8. **Recap and Resources**: How to apply these learnings in your context

## Demo Resources
