# Provisioning SQL Server 2025 Databases to Kubernetes with Pure Storage Snapshots

Hosted by Microsoft Developer, this episode of Data Exposed explores practical techniques for integrating Microsoft SQL Server 2025 with Pure Storage snapshots in Kubernetes environments.

## Key Topics

- **Rapid SQL Server Database Cloning:** Learn how Pure Storage snapshot technology enables instant copies of SQL Server databases running on Linux for use in Kubernetes clusters.
- **Streamlined Dev/Test Workflows:** Discover strategies to enable fast data refresh and efficient lifecycle management in containerized database applications.
- **Integration with Enterprise-Grade Storage:** See how enterprise storage features can be seamlessly combined with the agility of Kubernetes for SQL Server solutions.

## Demo Walkthrough

- **Introduction** (0:00)
- **Cloning a Database to Kubernetes Cluster** (2:30)
- **Live Demo** (4:41)

This episode includes step-by-step demonstrations and detailed explanations on:

- Deploying and managing SQL Server Linux containers
- Using Pure Storage snapshots for rapid cloning and data refresh
- Managing distributed and cross-platform availability groups
