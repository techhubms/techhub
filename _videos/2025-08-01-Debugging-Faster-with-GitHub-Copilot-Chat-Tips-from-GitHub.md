# Debugging Faster with GitHub Copilot Chat

**Author:** GitHub

---

## Overview

Debugging code can be a time-consuming process, but GitHub Copilot chat introduces new, efficient ways to resolve issues directly within your development environment.

Based on the segment from the "GitHub Copilot deep dive" video ([watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oz-WQi51aU)), this guide outlines how developers can use Copilot chat for faster, smarter debugging.

---

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Paste Error Messages**: Developers can paste error messages directly into Copilot chat, receiving guidance or suggested fixes tailored to the issue.
- **Bug Screenshot Analysis**: By dragging and dropping screenshots showing bugs or problematic code, Copilot chat interprets visual context to assist with troubleshooting.
- **Context from External Files**: You can supply files that aren't part of your project—such as relevant configuration files or external data—to give Copilot greater context when generating debugging solutions.

## Practical Debugging Workflow

1. **Encounter an Error:** When facing an error message during development, copy and paste it into the Copilot chat window.
2. **Add Visual Context:** If the issue is visible in your application's UI or an output window, take a screenshot and drag it into the chat for further clarification.
3. **Provide Extra Context:** If the error may be related to settings or data external to the main project, submit the relevant files through the chat interface.
4. **Receive Tailored Help:** Copilot chat processes all provided information, offering actionable suggestions or code corrections based on the detailed context submitted.
