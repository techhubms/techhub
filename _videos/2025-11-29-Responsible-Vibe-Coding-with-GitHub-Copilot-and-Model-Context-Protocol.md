# Responsible Vibe Coding with GitHub Copilot and Model Context Protocol

## Speaker

- Rizel Scarlett, Tech Lead of Open Source Developer Relations, Block

## Overview

This session at GitHub Universe 2025 dives into the concept of 'vibe coding'—using AI agents like GitHub Copilot to write code in a freeform, exploratory way. Rizel addresses the risks developers face, such as agents overwriting files, leaking API keys, or hallucinating broken processes, and introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a solution for more structured, context-aware AI development.

## Key Topics

- **Vibe Coding vs Vibe Engineering**: Defining the difference between letting AI take the lead and guiding its output responsibly.
- **Three Principles for Responsible AI Coding**:
  1. **Power**: Selecting appropriate LLM capabilities for each use case.
  2. **Context**: Supplying precise, relevant information to AI agents to mitigate errors and unintended actions.
  3. **Control**: Remaining actively engaged as the human 'pilot,' using protocols like Agent Client Protocol to assert oversight.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**:
  - Adds structure and contextual awareness to prompt engineering.
  - Enables safer, more observable interactions with AI agents.
- **GitHub MCP Server**:
  - Facilitates context and control for developers during AI coding.
  - Demoed tools:
    - Goose (creating issues via MCP)
    - MCP UI (visualizes team workload)
- **Agent Client Protocol**:
  - Allows for ongoing monitoring and engagement with AI agents to prevent automated mistakes.

## Demos

- Creating GitHub issues with Goose through MCP
- Visualizing team workloads using MCP UI

## Conclusion

- Emphasizes that developers remain the pilot, not just the passenger, when working with AI agents.
- Encourages leveraging the new protocols to keep productivity high and errors low.
