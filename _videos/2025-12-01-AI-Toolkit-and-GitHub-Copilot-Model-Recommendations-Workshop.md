description: "In this video, April from Microsoft Developer presents Part 2 of the AI Toolkit and GitHub Copilot workshop series, focusing on using Copilot's Agent mode to recommend language models for AI agents. She demonstrates how developers can use Copilot in conjunction with the AI Toolkit to analyze scenarios, select optimal language models, deploy them from the Model Catalog, and compare their performance in the Model Playground. Essential setup steps, such as installing the AI Toolkit and initializing a Microsoft Foundry project, are also covered, with links and resources provided throughout."

# AI Toolkit and GitHub Copilot: Model Recommendations Workshop

### Presenter

April (Microsoft Developer)

### Overview

This video is part two of the AI Toolkit + GitHub Copilot Pet Planner workshop series. April demonstrates how developers can leverage Copilot in Agent mode to get intelligent model recommendations, use the AI Toolkit to deploy models, and effectively compare model performance for AI-powered agents.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Agent Mode in Copilot**: April shows how to interact with Copilot in Agent mode to receive recommendations for optimal language models based on scenario requirements.
- **Using the Model Catalog**: Demonstrates deploying models directly from the AI Toolkit's Model Catalog.
- **Model Playground**: Guidance on testing and comparing the effectiveness of deployed models in a sandbox environment.
- **Deleting Model Deployments**: Best practices for managing model resources, including removal of unused deployments.
- **Workshop Resources**:
  - [Repo & Instructions](https://aka.ms/AIToolkit/workshop)
  - [Install AI Toolkit](https://aka.ms/AIToolkit)
  - [Setup Foundry Project](https://ai.azure.com)
  - [Model and Tools Announcements](https://aka.ms/model-mondays)
  - [Join Discord](https://aka.ms/insideMF/discord)
  - [Forum](https://aka.ms/insideMF/forum)

### Chapter Markers
