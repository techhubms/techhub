## Key Features in VS Code 1.103

This release brings significant enhancements to the agent experience, providing better control, visibility, and recovery options when working with AI-powered coding assistance.

### Checkpoints: Time Travel in Agent Mode

The Checkpoints feature is a game-changer for agent workflows, allowing developers to save and restore specific points in their coding session. This means you can experiment with different AI-generated solutions and easily return to previous states if needed, providing a safety net for exploration and experimentation.

### Todo List for Agent Tasks

The new Todo list feature provides clear visibility into the tasks that GitHub Copilot has executed during an agent session. This creates a transparent record of AI actions, making it easier to understand what changes were made and verify the agent's work.

### GPT-5 Model Support

VS Code 1.103 introduces support for OpenAI's GPT-5 model, offering improved code understanding and generation capabilities. The release also includes enhanced model management tools, making it easier to switch between different AI models based on your needs.

### Terminal Enhancements

Terminal capabilities receive significant upgrades:

- **Terminal Inline Chat**: Access GitHub Copilot directly within the terminal for quick assistance without context switching
- **Terminal Auto Approval**: Configure automatic approval of terminal commands suggested by the AI
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Faster execution of common terminal tasks with AI assistance

### Additional Features

The release includes several other notable improvements:

- **Enhanced Tool Picker**: Better interface for selecting and using available tools
- **Edit Chat Request**: Modify previous chat requests to refine your queries
- **MCP Autostart**: Automatically initialize Model Context Protocol servers on startup
- **AI Stats**: Track and analyze your AI usage patterns
- **Pull Request Extension Improvements**: Enhanced GitHub integration for PR workflows
- **Math Rendering**: Proper display of mathematical expressions in chat responses

Fokko provides comprehensive demonstrations of each feature, including practical examples of how Checkpoints and Todo lists enhance the agent experience. The video includes detailed timestamps for easy navigation.
