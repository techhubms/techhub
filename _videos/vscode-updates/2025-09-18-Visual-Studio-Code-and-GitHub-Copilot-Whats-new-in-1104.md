## Key Features in VS Code 1.104

This release emphasizes intelligent automation and customization, giving developers more control over their AI-assisted development experience while reducing friction in common workflows.

### Auto Model Selection

VS Code 1.104 introduces intelligent model selection that automatically chooses the most appropriate AI model based on the type of task you're performing. This eliminates the need to manually switch between models and ensures you're always using the optimal model for your specific use case.

### AGENTS.md Support

The new support for AGENTS.md files allows teams to define custom agent behaviors and configurations in a standardized markdown format. This enables sharing of agent configurations across team members and projects, ensuring consistent AI assistance patterns.

### Configurable Prompt File Suggestions

Developers can now configure how and when VS Code suggests prompt files, providing more control over the prompt-driven development workflow. This feature makes it easier to leverage reusable prompts while reducing unnecessary interruptions.

### Enhanced Chat Sessions Management

The chat sessions view receives significant improvements, offering better organization and navigation of chat history. This makes it easier to reference previous conversations and maintain context across multiple development sessions.

### Custom Chat Modes in Prompt Files

Prompt files can now leverage custom chat modes, allowing developers to create specialized prompting patterns that align with their specific workflows and project requirements.

### Additional Improvements

The release includes several other productivity enhancements:

- **Confirm Edits to Sensitive Files**: Additional safety measures when modifying critical files
- **Improved Changed Files Experience**: Better visibility and management of modified files
- **Delegate to Coding Agent**: Seamless handoff from chat to coding agent for complex tasks
- **Terminal Auto Approve**: Streamlined terminal command execution with configurable approval
- **Improved Task Support**: Enhanced integration with VS Code's task system

Fokko provides in-depth demonstrations of each feature with practical examples, showing how they integrate into real development workflows. The video includes detailed timestamps for easy navigation to specific topics.
