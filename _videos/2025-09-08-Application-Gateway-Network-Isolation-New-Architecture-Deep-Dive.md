# Application Gateway Network Isolation: New Architecture Deep Dive

## Overview

John Savill delivers an in-depth video focused on Azure Application Gatewayâ€™s network isolation capabilities. This new architecture removes the traditional requirement for a public endpoint, addressing several previous limitations and providing enhanced deployment flexibility.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to App Gateway Network**
  - Distinction between App GW V1 and V2 versions
- **Frontend Configuration**
  - Traditional requirements for public endpoints
  - New support for private deployments
- **Shared Data and Control Plane Implications**
  - How management and data channels are separated
  - Security rules required for operation
- **Adopting the New Network Isolated Architecture**
  - Steps to onboard existing and new Application Gateways
  - Enabling the new features via configuration flags
- **Impact on Deployment Architecture**
  - Changes in deployment flow and resource security
  - Updated control plane traffic paths
- **Working with the Flag Settings**
  - How to set and unset the network isolation flag
  - Note that the change is effective for new deployments only
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Support**
  - Differences with WAF in the new architecture
- **Limitations and Considerations**
  - Limitations currently present in the network isolated model
  - Architectural trade-offs

- [Required Security Rules Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/configuration-infrastructure#required-security-rules)
- [Network Isolation Official Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-private-deployment?tabs=portal#onboard-to-the-feature)

## Resources & Learning

- [Video Whiteboard](https://github.com/johnthebrit/RandomStuff/raw/master/Whiteboards/AppGWNetworkIsolation.png)
- Azure learning, certification, and master class playlists curated for further upskilling.

## Practical Takeaways

- Network isolation enhances security by eliminating the necessity of public endpoints on the Application Gateway.
- New flag-based deployment options allow for greater architectural flexibility.
- There are still limitations to be considered, especially for enterprises transitioning from older models.
