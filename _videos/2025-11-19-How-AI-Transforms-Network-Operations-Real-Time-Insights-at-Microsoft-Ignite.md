title: "How AI Transforms Network Operations: Real-Time Insights at Microsoft Ignite"
description: "This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 demonstrates how AI is revolutionizing network operations (NetOps) by moving beyond traditional scripting toward intelligent workflows. Key topics include incident triage, knowledge retrieval, traffic analysis, prediction, and monitoring. The presentation explores how machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agent workflows — including text-to-SQL and real-time analytics — are enabling modern NetOps. The discussion covers the design of data pipelines, MLOps strategies, API integration, human-in-the-loop guardrails, accuracy, reliability, cost, compliance, and the build-versus-buy decision for AI infrastructure."

# How AI Transforms Network Operations: From Theory to Reality

**Speaker:** Phillip Gervasi  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Session ID:** ODSP1420

---

## Introduction

AI is accelerating the evolution of network operations (NetOps), moving organizations past legacy scripted automation to intelligent, data-driven workflows. This session explores practical applications and the architecture needed to support modern, AI-powered NetOps.

---

## Key Topics Covered

- **Incident Triage:** AI enables faster, more accurate triage by analyzing network data in real-time, identifying anomalies, and prioritizing issues.
- **Knowledge Retrieval:** Leverages LLMs and NLP to search vast data repositories and documentation, reducing time to resolution.
- **Traffic Analysis and Prediction:** Machine learning models detect traffic patterns, forecast potential issues, and optimize resource allocation.
- **Monitoring Evolution:** Contrasts legacy monitoring systems with ML/NLP/LLM-powered analytics. New approaches support predictive and prescriptive capabilities.

---

## AI Architecture for NetOps

- **Solid Data Foundation:** Reliability begins with foundational data architecture that supports scalable, real-time workflows.
- **APIs and Integrations:** Accurate and timely data access through robust APIs is essential for automated and manual interventions.
- **Natural Language Interfaces:** Examples include converting user queries to SQL using NLP, allowing non-technical users to extract insights.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** RAG integrates external or hybrid network data for enhanced query results and knowledge graphs.
- **Agent Workflows:** Multi-agent systems collaborate for complex tasks and manage real-time insights across hybrid environments.

---

## MLOps and Data Pipelines

- **Data Pipelines:** Architecting scalable data ingestion, ETL, and monitoring processes enables robust ML model deployment in NetOps.
- **MLOps:** Strategies for model training, validation, deployment, and monitoring tailored to dynamic network environments.

---

## Practical Considerations

- **Build vs Buy:** Weighing the flexibility of custom solutions vs. the speed and reliability of vendor offerings when implementing AI infrastructure.
- **Accuracy and Reliability:** Addressing model performance, trustworthiness, and operational impact in high-stakes network contexts.
- **Cost and Compliance:** Managing operational expenses and meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., data privacy).
- **Human-in-the-Loop Guardrails:** Ensuring expert oversight for critical automation scenarios, balancing speed and control.
