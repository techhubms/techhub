description: "This episode in the Godot C# training series led by dotnet explores foundational concepts in Godot game development, focusing on scenes and nodes. It demonstrates creating level scenes, adding collision, building reusable characters, and setting up third-person camera systems, using C# and Godot's node-based architecture. You'll learn through hands-on walkthroughs with code, practical GitHub resources, and a learning challenge."

# Scenes and Nodes - The Core Building Blocks in Godot with C# (Part 4 of 9)

In Episode 4 of our Godot C# training series, we explore the core principles and tools you need to start actual game development in Godot using C#.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Scenes and Nodes in Godot:** Learn how scenes and nodes compose the foundation of Godot projects.
- **Creating a Level Scene:** Step-by-step instructions to build your first level, add a ground plane, and implement collision detection.
- **Building a Reusable Player Character:** Use CharacterBody3D for a player character and integrate a third-person camera setup with SpringArm3D.
- **Node Hierarchy and Mesh Setup:** Organize your game objects, optimize for reuse, and work with 3D meshes.
- **Lighting:** Add directional lighting and adjust settings for visual fidelity.
- **Reusable Scenes:** Improve design efficiency using scene instancing so obstacles or items can be reused easily.

## Walkthrough

1. **Scenes and Nodes in Godot:** Understand why Godot uses scenes as the basic unit and nodes for building behavior.
2. **Creating the Level Scene:** Set up the project and create a simple level scene that will host all gameplay.
3. **Adding Ground and Collision:** Add a ground mesh with collision so the player character has a surface to move on.
4. **Player Character and Camera:** Build a CharacterBody3D player and attach a camera with SpringArm3D to follow player movement.
5. **Node Inheritance:** Learn how inheritance helps reuse scene logic and behavior.
6. **Lighting:** Create realistic lighting using DirectionalLight3D.
7. **Reusable Scene Instancing:** Demonstrate making obstacles as reusable scenes for rapid level building.

## Hands-On Challenge

- **Create a new Obstacle Scene:** Design an obstacle that blocks the player, and experiment with material and rendering settings.
