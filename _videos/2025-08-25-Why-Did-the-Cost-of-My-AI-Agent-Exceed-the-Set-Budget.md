# Why Did the Cost of My AI Agent Exceed the Set Budget?

**Presented by:** Microsoft Developer  
**From:** Azure AI Foundry Community Question of the Week

This video addresses a frequently asked question in the Azure AI Foundry community: _"Why did the cost of my AI Agent exceed the set budget?"_

## Key Discussion Points

- **Understanding Cost Overruns:**
  - AI Agents in Azure can sometimes incur higher charges due to factors like increased usage, unanticipated resource needs, or configuration issues.
  - Costs may also rise if the agent accesses premium models, consumes more tokens, or processes more data than forecasted.

- **Monitoring Usage:**
  - Implement Azure budget alerts and cost controls.
  - Use Azure Cost Management and Billing to track real-time spending.

- **Optimization Strategies:**
  - Review the configuration and assigned limits of your AI Agent.
  - Analyze usage patterns and adjust quotas or turn on rate limiting as needed.
  - Consider using model-specific cost management features in Azure AI Foundry.
