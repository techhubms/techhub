## Overview

This session presents an honest, firsthand discussion on using Dapper and Entity Framework Core (EF Core) in real-world .NET applications. The speakers detail the strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs between the two data access technologies.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Dapper:** Lightweight micro-ORM known for simplicity and speed
- **Entity Framework Core:** Full-featured .NET ORM supporting advanced querying and change tracking
- Comparing scenarios when Dapper’s raw performance and simplicity are preferable
- Identifying project types and requirements where EF Core’s full ORM capabilities make sense
- Common pitfalls, workarounds, and performance tuning tips
- Recommendations for choosing the right approach based on team skills, project complexity, and maintainability
