# Implementing Vector Search in Your Application with SQL Server 2025

Presented by Microsoft Developer, this Data Exposed: MVP Edition episode, featuring Joseph D'Antoni, dives into:

## Key Topics

- **Semantic Search**: Moves beyond basic concepts, detailing how semantic search enables applications to understand context and meaning in data queries.
- **Vector Search in SQL Server 2025**: Explains vector storage and retrieval and shows implementation steps using Transact-SQL functions and SQL Server's new vector features.
- **Data Ingestion at Scale**: Techniques to ingest and manage large datasets for AI workloads, focusing on performance optimization within SQL Server and Azure SQL environments.
- **Application Integration**: Integrating vector search into real-world app scenarios to support modern AI needs.

## Demo

- Step-by-step demo showing how to set up vector search on SQL Server 2025
- Implementing supporting features using T-SQL
