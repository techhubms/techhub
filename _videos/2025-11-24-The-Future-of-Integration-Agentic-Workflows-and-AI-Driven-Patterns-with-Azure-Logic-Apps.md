# The Future of Integration: Agentic Workflows and AI-Driven Patterns with Azure Logic Apps

Presented by Pratik Shinde, Eric Summers, Divya Swarnkar, and Kent Weare at Microsoft Ignite 2025, this session dives into the next era of enterprise integration. Key topics include the shift from simple system connectivity to adaptive, agentic workflows that join apps, data, and systems using Azure technologies.

## Key Learning Points

- **Modernizing Integration:**
  - Move beyond traditional point-to-point connections to intelligent, adaptive agentic workflows.
  - Understanding the role of Azure Logic Apps for orchestrating and automating business and IT processes.

- **AI-Driven Patterns:**
  - Implementing AI to drive agility and intelligence in integration.
  - How Agent Loop in Logic Apps streamlines workflow execution and enables scalable automation.

- **Migration from BizTalk:**
  - Practical guidance and demos on migrating integrations from BizTalk Server to Azure Logic Apps.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
  - Introducing MCP as a new protocol for context-aware enterprise integration.
  - Leveraging MCP in Logic Apps for secure, compliant automation workflows.

- **Security and Compliance:**
  - Built-in features for access control, compliance, and onboarding agents.
  - Example: Maintaining audit trails and approval workflows with ServiceNow.

- **Agent Deployment and Use Cases:**
  - Deploy agents for tasks like scheduling meetings and syncing CRM data (e.g., Salesforce).
  - Extend the same agent functionality into Microsoft Teams for in-app productivity enhancements.
  - Real-world case study of Vertex’s multi-agent system for improved productivity and compliance.

## Demo Highlights

- Scheduling meetings and managing transcripts using Logic Apps agents.
- Syncing data into Salesforce CRM and updating secrets in ServiceNow with human approval.
- Deploying and governing agent lists, including access control and audit features.
- Extending agent functions into Microsoft Teams for deeper business integration.
- Monitoring results: cost savings, performance improvements, scalability.
