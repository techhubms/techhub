# Exploring Discriminated Unions Coming to C# 15 and 16

**Author:** Nick Chapsas

Nick Chapsas introduces the concept and proposal for Discriminated Unions (commonly called Unions) in the C# programming language. This video highlights the new features previewed for C# 15 and their potential full implementation in C# 16. The presentation includes:

- An overview of the Unions proposal and its background
- Detailed explanation of how Discriminated Unions work in C#
- Motivation for adding Unions as a language feature
- The expected impact on the .NET developer experience
- Timeline: Unions as a preview feature in C# 15, and possible full release in C# 16
- Practical scenarios where Unions can simplify code structure, such as representing multiple possible types in a safe manner

Nick also directs viewers to his workshops and other educational content. The discussion is aimed at developers who want to understand upcoming changes in the .NET ecosystem and how these changes can affect their coding practices.
