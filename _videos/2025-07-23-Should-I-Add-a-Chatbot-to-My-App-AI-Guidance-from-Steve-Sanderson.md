### Overview

Steve Sanderson addresses a common question in modern application development: Should you add a chatbot to your app? While chatbots are a visible AI use case, Sanderson advises developers and organizations to carefully consider their AI strategy before implementation.

### Key Insights

- **Chatbot Hype vs. Value:**
  - Chatbots are frequently discussed as the go-to approach for adding AI to applications. They can provide users with conversational experiences and automate some customer interactions.
  - However, they might not always be the most effective or efficient way to integrate AI capabilities into an existing system.

- **Focus on Business Process Automation:**
  - Sanderson suggests that automating business processes with AI is often a more immediate source of value.
  - Automating backend workflows can streamline operations, reduce human error, and increase efficiency without disrupting the user interface or requiring users to change how they interact with the software.

- **Faster Value, Less Disruption:**
  - By targeting automation of core business processes, organizations can see tangible benefits of AI sooner. This approach often requires fewer changes to the user experience and can be easier to maintain and evolve.

### Practical Advice

- **Evaluate Your Needs:**
  - Before investing in a chatbot, assess if a conversational interface is necessary for your audience.
  - Consider whether automating repetitive or decision-heavy tasks in your business processes will yield a better return.

- **Start with Process Automation:**
  - Use AI to streamline internal workflows before moving to more outward-facing applications like chatbots.
