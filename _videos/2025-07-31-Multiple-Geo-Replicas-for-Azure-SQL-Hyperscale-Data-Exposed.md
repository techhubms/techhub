# Multiple geo-replicas for Azure SQL Hyperscale | Data Exposed

**Presenter:** Anna Hoffman, Microsoft Developer

## Introduction

Azure SQL Hyperscale is set to receive a significant update, boosting its geo-replication capabilities by increasing the maximum number of supported geo-replicas from one to four. This enhancement, arriving as a public preview in late summer 2025, aligns Hyperscale with the rest of the Azure SQL Database family regarding high availability and disaster recovery features.

## Hyperscale Secondary Replicas

- **Whatâ€™s new?**
  - Previously, Azure SQL Hyperscale only supported a single geo-replica.
  - After the update, users can configure up to four geo-replicas for increased redundancy and scalability.
  - This change enables organizations to better design for business continuity and global read workloads.
- **Benefits:**
  - Improved failover options
  - Enhanced read-scale scenarios
  - Easier compliance with disaster recovery requirements

## Demo

The video includes a step-by-step demonstration on how to set up and manage secondary geo-replicas within Azure SQL Hyperscale. Topics covered include:

- Creating and configuring secondary replicas
- Monitoring replica status
- Performing failover operations
- Best practices for replica deployment

## Getting Started

- To get started with Azure SQL Hyperscale geo-replicas:
  1. Review the [supporting documentation](https://aka.ms/HSreplicas)
  2. Access the feature in Azure once it launches in public preview (late Summer 2025)
  3. Implement secondary replicas as required for business needs
