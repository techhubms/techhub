# AI Security Challenges in GitHub's Secure Code Game Season 3

GitHub presents the third season of the Secure Code Game, a competitive platform designed for developers interested in learning about AI security threats and defensive coding techniques.

## Game Overview

- **Objective:** Outsmart a large language model (LLM) by crafting prompts that exploit vulnerabilities and cause it to leak secrets.
- **Remediation:** After successfully attacking the LLM, participants must identify and fix the code to address the security issue, demonstrating defense-in-depth strategies.
- **Technology:** The game uses GitHub Codespaces, making it accessible and easy to join for anyone interested in AI, cybersecurity, or secure development practices.

## Key Features

- **AI Security Focus:** Challenges center around prompt injection, vulnerability analysis, and securing LLM-based applications.
- **Hands-On Learning:** Participants practice both offensive (ethical hacking) and defensive (code patching) skills.
- **Quick Sessions:** Complete challenges in under a minute, making the game approachable for busy developers.
- **Free Participation:** The Secure Code Game is open to the public at [gh.io/secure-code-game](http://gh.io/secure-code-game).
