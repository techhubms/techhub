# How AI Voice Agents Transform Medical Documentation in Real Time

Medical professionals often face the challenge of time-consuming manual documentation, which can reduce meaningful patient interaction. This session introduces an AI-powered Medical Voice Agent that allows clinicians to dictate notes, enabling artificial intelligence to automatically extract vital details—such as symptoms, medications, and next steps—from the dictated text.

The extracted, structured data is instantly populated into a Microsoft Model-Driven App, enhancing both accuracy and reducing the likelihood of errors. Additionally, a built-in text-based Copilot agent summarizes past patient visits and assists with workflow actions like scheduling follow-ups or issuing medication reminders based on previously discussed information.

## Workflow Highlights

- **Manual to Automated Documentation**: Dictation by clinicians is processed using AI, shifting from manual entry to automated, structured data capture.
- **Structured Data Integration**: Information is mapped directly to Model-Driven Apps for seamless clinical record management.
- **Copilot-Driven Summarization**: A conversational agent summarizes previous appointments and highlights actionable tasks, supporting clinicians' decision-making.
- **Efficiency and Safety**: Automating tasks and reminders results in safer, more efficient care and allows practitioners to focus more on patient interaction.
