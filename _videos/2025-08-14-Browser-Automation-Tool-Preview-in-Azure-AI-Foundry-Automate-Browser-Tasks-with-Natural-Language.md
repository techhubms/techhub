# Browser Automation Tool (Preview) in Azure AI Foundry

**Presenter:** April (Microsoft Developer)

## Overview

Discover the capabilities of the Browser Automation Tool (Preview) in Azure AI Foundry. This video demonstrates how developers can use natural language prompts to instruct an agent, which then analyzes the web page structure and performs browser-based tasks automatically in a secure, isolated cloud environment.

## Key Highlights

- **Natural Language Requests:** Provide instructions in plain English to an AI agent.
- **Playwright Workspaces:** Automations run securely and in isolation within Azure-hosted workspaces.
- **Agent Autonomy:** The AI model inspects web pages, determines workflows, and adapts step-by-step until the requested task is complete.
- **Security:** Every session is isolated within your Azure subscription to protect data and prevent cross-contamination.
- **Visual Studio Code Demo:** The video includes a segment demonstrating how to run provided sample code using VS Code for browser automation.

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. **Introduction (0:00 - 1:30):** Brief on automation capabilities and potential use cases.
2. **Playwright Workspace Creation (1:31 - 4:09):** How to create a dedicated workspace resource in Azure for running automation tasks.
3. **Connecting the Workspace (4:10 - 5:24):** Instructions to connect your Playwright Workspace to Azure AI Foundry for streamlined automation.
4. **Hands-On Demo (5:25 - 11:07):** Running sample code in Visual Studio Code, demonstrating agent-driven browser automation powered by Azure.
5. **Conclusion (11:08 - 11:36):** Recap and encouragement to try it out for real-world automation needs.
