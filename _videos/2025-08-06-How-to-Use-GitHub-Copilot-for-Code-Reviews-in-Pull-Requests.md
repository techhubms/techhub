## How to Use GitHub Copilot for Code Reviews in Pull Requests

**Author:** GitHub

Are you dealing with code that's not quite ready or want a second set of eyes before requesting a peer review? GitHub Copilot now offers functionality as an automated code reviewer directly within your pull requests. This feature is designed to help developers:

- Catch issues and make improvements before formal team review
- Quickly implement suggested changes—individually or in batches
- Enhance code quality and reduce bottlenecks in the review process

### Key Features

- **Requesting a Review:** You can ask GitHub Copilot to review a pull request, leveraging its AI capabilities to identify areas for improvement based on the latest changes in your branch.
- **Accepting Suggestions:** Copilot provides recommendations, whether for small fixes or larger changes. You can accept these suggestions one at a time or process them in batches, all with a single click.
- **Streamlined Code Quality:** By integrating Copilot as your first reviewer, potential issues are resolved earlier, leading to cleaner code submissions to your team.

### Benefits

- **Faster Feedback:** Instantly spot and address problems without waiting for other developers.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Copilot suggests best practices and removes common mistakes automatically.
- **Reduced Team Friction:** Solving minor issues upfront leads to more productive and focused team code reviews.
