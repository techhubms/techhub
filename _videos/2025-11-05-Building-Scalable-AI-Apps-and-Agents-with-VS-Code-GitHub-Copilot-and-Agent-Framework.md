# Building Scalable AI Apps and Agents with VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and Agent Framework

**Presented by:** Amanda Silver, Rong Lu, Shayne Boyer (Microsoft)  
**Event:** GitHub Universe 2025

## Overview

This session demonstrates a modern AI-powered developer workflow using VS Code, GitHub Copilot, AI Toolkit, and the open-source Agent Framework. The presenters walk through:

- Turning GitHub Copilot and the AI Toolkit into a flexible AI development workbench
- Using Spec Kit for spec-driven development to move from requirements to working code
- Building and orchestrating intelligent AI agents that scale
- Deploying multi-agent workflows to Azure AI Foundry with built-in observability, tracing, and safety
- Managing live site operations such as incident response with Azure SRE agents

## Key Demos and Highlights

### 1. Spec-Driven App Development

- Begin with high-level specifications, leveraging Spec Kit to automate code generation and ensure the implementation matches business requirements.
- Demonstrates the iterative process from initial spec to production-level code using VS Code and Copilot.

### 2. Adding Intelligence: Building and Automating AI Agents

- Use the AI Toolkit to architect, implement, and automate AI-powered agents that adapt to developer workflows.
- Walkthrough of integrating GitHub Copilot to assist with agent behavior creation and task automation.

### 3. Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Demo of orchestrating complex workflows involving multiple cooperating AI agents using the Agent Framework.
- Showcases best practices for communication, coordination, and scaling within multi-agent systems.

### 4. Operations and Observability

- How to deploy these intelligent apps and agent workflows to Azure AI Foundry, incorporating tools for observability and tracing.
- Segment on operationalizing AI: managing incidents using the Azure SRE agent, automating incident response for live systems.

### 5. Security and Scalability

- Patterns and guidance for building secure, scalable intelligent applications (including built-in safety and tracing mechanisms).
- Advice for shipping robust solutions from first commit to production.

## Takeaways

- Real-world patterns for integrating AI into developer workflows
- Step-by-step demos illustrating end-to-end development, deployment, and operations
- Guidance on using Microsoft and GitHub developer tools for AI-powered apps and agent orchestration
- Emphasis on security, scalability, and reliability across the software lifecycle
