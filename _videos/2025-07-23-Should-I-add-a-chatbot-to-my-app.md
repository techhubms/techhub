## Summary

Steve Sanderson, featured in this #OneDevQuestion article by dotnet, discusses the considerations surrounding the integration of chatbots into applications. According to Sanderson, adding a chatbot may not always be the most practical starting point when implementing AI. He suggests that automating business processes with AI tends to provide faster results and introduces less disruption to existing workflows.

Sanderson emphasizes the importance of evaluating the needs and value propositions for your business before adopting conversational AI. Using AI to streamline internal operations or automate repetitive tasks often leads to clearer, more immediate benefits than deploying chatbots for user interaction.

The article concludes with a referral to Microsoft's AI Learning Hub, offering readers opportunities to further explore AI-driven business solutions and best practices for effective adoption.

### Key Points

- Chatbots are not always the optimal entry point for AI in apps
- Automating business processes may deliver quicker, less disruptive gains
- Consider your app’s needs and value creation when choosing AI implementations
- Further learning resources are available via the AI Learning Hub
