# Building Smarter Edge AI with Windows AI PCs: The Edge AI for Beginners Curriculum

**Author: Lee_Stott**

## Introduction

The frontier of AI is shifting from centralized cloud clusters to the powerful local accelerators within Windows AI PCs. As edge AI development matures, developers have new opportunities to build intelligent, privacy-aware, and high-performance applications that run directly on devices such as industrial cameras, healthcare tools, and IoT endpoints.

## Why Edge AI, Why Now?

- **Latency**: Achieve decision-making in milliseconds without relying on the cloud
- **Privacy**: Enable HIPAA/GDPR compliance by keeping sensitive data on-device
- **Resilience**: Offline-capable apps that maintain functionality even if networks fail
- **Cost**: Save on cloud compute and bandwidth by running inference locally

With Windows AI PCs and hardware from Intel and Qualcomm, along with developer toolchains like ONNX Runtime, DirectML, and Microsoft Olive, building and optimizing edge models is more accessible than ever.

## What You’ll Learn: Edge AI for Beginners Curriculum

- [Edge AI for Beginners](https://aka.ms/edgeai-for-beginners) is an open-source course for hands-on engineers.
- Available in over 48 languages.
- Moves from fundamental concepts to enterprise-grade deployment.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Small Language Models (SLMs)** for efficient, edge deployment
- **Hardware-aware optimization** for diverse platforms
- **Real-time, privacy-preserving inference**
- **Production deployment** strategies

## Edge AI Essentials

Edge AI means running AI models and language functions locally, close to where data is generated. This unlocks:

- **On-device inference** on phones, routers, microcontrollers, and industrial PCs
- **Offline capability**: Functionality without internet
- **Low latency** for real-time interactions
- **Data sovereignty** for security and compliance

### SLMs (Small Language Models)

SLMs such as Phi-4, Mistral-7B, Qwen, and Gemma are optimized for:

- Reduced memory and compute footprint
- Fast initialization
- Use in embedded systems, IoT, mobile, and PCs

## Curriculum Structure (10+ Hours)

- **00 – Introduction to EdgeAI**: Foundations and objectives ([details](https://github.com/microsoft/edgeai-for-beginners/blob/main/introduction.md))
- **01 – EdgeAI Fundamentals**: Cloud vs Edge, deployment guides ([details](https://github.com/microsoft/edgeai-for-beginners/blob/main/Module01/README.md))
- **02 – SLM Model Foundations**: Architecture and practical model families ([details](https://github.com/microsoft/edgeai-for-beginners/blob/main/Module02/README.md))
- **03 – SLM Deployment Practice**: Local/cloud deployments ([details](https://github.com/microsoft/edgeai-for-beginners/blob/main/Module03/README.md))

- **07 – Platform Implementation**: Cross-platform and Windows development ([details](https://github.com/microsoft/edgeai-for-beginners/blob/main/Module07/README.md))
- **08 – Foundry Local Toolkit**: End-to-end production samples ([details](https://github.com/microsoft/edgeai-for-beginners/blob/main/Module08/README.md))

All modules include Jupyter notebooks, code samples, and deployment walkthroughs.

## Developer Highlights

- **Microsoft Olive**: Model optimization (quantization, pruning, acceleration)
- **ONNX Runtime**: Cross-platform AI inference engine
- **DirectML**: Windows-specific GPU-accelerated ML API
- **Windows AI PCs**: Integrated NPUs for efficient local inference

## Advanced Local AI Concepts

Using tools like Agent Framework, Azure AI Foundry, Windows Copilot Studio, and Foundry Local, developers can:

- Orchestrate local AI agents
- Blend LLMs, on-device sensors, and user preferences
- Build applications independent of the cloud

## Try It Yourself

- [Access the curriculum](https://aka.ms/edgeai-for-beginners) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoft/edgeai-for-beginners)
- Run example notebooks, deploy your own models to a Windows AI PC or IoT device
- Move from prototype to real-world production
