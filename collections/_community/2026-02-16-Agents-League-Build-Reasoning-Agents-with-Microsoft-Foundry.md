# Agents League: Build Reasoning Agents with Microsoft Foundry

**Author:** carlottacaste

The Agents League is back with a focus on agentic AI development! This time, the spotlight is on the **Reasoning Agents Track**, an opportunity for developers to explore, compete, and learn how to design intelligent multi-agent systems using **Microsoft Foundry**.

## What Are Reasoning Agents?

Reasoning agents go beyond standard prompt-response interfaces. In this challenge, participants will:

- Plan and orchestrate task execution
- Split problems into discrete steps
- Reason across intermediate results
- Verify or critique outputs
- Collaborate across multiple agents for complex problem solving

## Microsoft Foundry: The Underlying Platform

Microsoft Foundry provides a flexible, production-grade environment for agentic system design. Developers can leverage:

- **Role-based agents:** Define planner, executor, verifier, critic, and more
- Multi-agent orchestration and workflows
- Integration with external tools, APIs, and MCP servers
- Structured reasoning patterns and live debugging
- Visual development (UI) or programmatic control (SDK)

## How to Participate

1. **Register**: [Sign up for the Agents League](https://aka.ms/agentsleague/register) to join the challenge.
2. **Starter Kit**: Access the [Reasoning Agent Starter Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/agentsleague/tree/main/starter-kits/2-reasoning-agents) for sample architectures, tech stack guidance, and resources.
3. **Leverage AI Tools**: Use tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to accelerate your build process.

## Events Schedule

- **Live Coding Battle:**
  - *Wednesday, Feb 18 – 9:00 AM PT*
  - Watch developers design agent architectures and discuss AI reasoning strategies live on Microsoft Reactor.
  - Streamed and recorded for later viewing.
- **AMA Session on Discord:**
  - *Wednesday, Feb 25 – 9:00 AM PT*
  - Ask about agent architecture, Foundry features, MCP integration, troubleshooting, and more.
  - [Join Discord](https://aka.ms/agentsleague/discord)

## Prizes and Recognition

- **$500** prize for the top Reasoning Agents project
- **Digital badges** for everyone who registers and submits a project
- Direct feedback from Microsoft product teams

**Remember**: Registration is required before submission to be eligible for prizes and badges.
