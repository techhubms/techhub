Authored by elizObserves, this article advocates for making observability a core discipline for developers, not just SREs, and offers a practical entry point for those new to the topic.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

In this community article, elizObserves addresses a recurring topic seen frequently in DevOps and SRE online communities: how software developers can break into observability and why it's crucial for them, not just for site reliability engineers (SREs). The author highlights the need for developers to actively consider observability early in the software development lifecycle, instead of treating it as an afterthought or delegating it solely to SREs.

Key points discussed:

- **Trending Questions Online**: It's common to see developers reaching out on forums with questions about how to get started with observability and DevOps practices.

- **Observability for All Developers**: The article serves as both a wake-up call and a guide for developers, stressing that observability is integral to modern engineering—not just the remit of reliability or operations specialists.

- **Getting Started**: The author links to a detailed external playbook containing actionable steps for developers to adopt observability. This playbook is positioned as a resource to help demystify the topic and provide clear guidance.

- **Modern Expectations**: As applications grow in complexity and deployments become more distributed, active observability practices are now a necessity for building, launching, and maintaining robust systems.

## Practical Highlights

- **Integrating Observability Early**: Developers are encouraged to consider observability requirements during development, ensuring systems can be monitored, debugged, and improved.

- **Essential Techniques**: The importance of metrics, logging, and tracing is underlined as foundational skills for developers.

- **Resources for Beginners**: The author shares a blog post (linked) to act as a short playbook for developers seeking to get started with these concepts.

## Conclusion

elizObserves calls on developers to adopt an observability mindset and provides resources for that purpose. The article serves as an accessible entry point for those aiming to enhance their development and operational practices, ensuring that building observable applications is seen as a critical engineering skill.
