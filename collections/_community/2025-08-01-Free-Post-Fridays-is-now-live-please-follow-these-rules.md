## Free Post Fridays Community Rules

**Author:** AutoModerator

The 'Free Post Fridays' initiative is now live. Please ensure you follow these community guidelines for posting:

1. **Appropriate Content Only:**
   - Do not post hateful, harmful, or distasteful content.
   - Keep content workplace-safe, recognizing that most members are at work.

2. **No Exam Dumps or Ads:**
   - Posting exam dumps, advertisements, or promoting paid services is strictly prohibited.

3. **Mandatory Azure Relevance:**
   - Every 'free post' must have a clear relationship to Azure. The connection to Azure can be loose but should be evident.

4. **Post Creativity Allowed:**
   - Meta posts and memes are permitted.
   - Fun content, such as memes like ones with "Good Guy Greg" hats, is allowable as long as general guidelines are followed.

5. **Designated Day Only:**
   - Free Post Fridays occurs only on Fridays. These posting freedoms do not apply on other days of the week.

By participating, members agree to maintain a respectful and safe environment while ensuring that content remains relevant to Azure, even when engaging in meta or humorous posts.

Please adhere to these rules to help foster a positive and productive community.
