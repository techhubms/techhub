MaxellVideocassette, new to GitHub Copilot and development practices, seeks advice on workflows with VS Code, Docker, and source control.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Background

The author identifies as primarily an HTML, CSS, and WordPress developer, self-described as a 'script kiddie.' With limited experience in other languages (JavaScript, PHP), they have recently started using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code to explore projects involving Angular and Node.js. They have also experimented with Docker, finding it somewhat beneficial for port visualization, though overall it created some workflow confusion regarding directories and workspace management.

## Current Workflow

- All code projects are stored on a secondary drive (E:) to separate them from important directories.
- Each project has its own folder, into which relevant files and a COPILOT.md descriptor file are placed.
- Copilot is used for guidance and automation of code generation.
- Git has recently been adopted as a mechanism for ‘restore points’ (version control), though the author is new to its use.

## Questions Presented

1. **Should projects be kept on GitHub instead of locally?**
   - The author is unsure about the benefits and process of remote repository hosting versus local file management.
2. **Should Docker remain part of their workflow?**
   - They appreciated Docker’s process visualization (ports, containers) but found it confusing and possibly disruptive.
3. **What improvements or changes should be made?**
   - General open-ended request for advice on what might be missing or done incorrectly in their setup.

## Additional Context

The post is submitted to Reddit’s r/GithubCopilot community. The author mentions comparing Gemini 2.5 and Claude 4 for code assistance, with a preference for Claude 4’s results with Angular (not the main topic but indicative of exploring various AI tools).

## Community Engagement

As a new user to both GitHub and Docker, the author seeks foundational guidance on:

- Effective project organization
- The role of version control systems like Git/GitHub
- The appropriateness of Docker for small development projects
- Best practices for leveraging GitHub Copilot as a learning and productivity tool
