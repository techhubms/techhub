# Modernizing for the AI Era: Accelerating Application Transformation with Agentic Tools

As organizations enter a new phase of digital transformation, artificial intelligence is transforming how applications are architected, developed, and operated. Many companies still grapple with legacy, monolithic, and poorly documented applications that hinder agility, modernization, and adoption of cloud and AI-based solutions.

## The Risks and Cost of Delayed Modernization

- Up to $85 billion lost annually due to technical debt (McKinsey)
- 40% of developer time spent maintaining legacy rather than building new features (Gartner)
- 66% of intended innovation budgets diverted to legacy system support (IDC)

## Legacy Applications: Common Barriers

- Outdated frameworks and dependencies misaligned with modern platforms
- Poor or absent documentation, with much knowledge lost to staff turnover
- Fragile integrations and complex, risk-prone workflows

Modernizing these systems is essential for succeeding in the AI era, and AI itself—leveraged through new tools—helps make this modernization achievable.

## Agentic Microsoft Tools for Modernization

### GitHub Copilot

- Goes beyond code suggestions to act as an end-to-end modernization partner
- Analyzes codebases for outdated libraries, frameworks, APIs
- Guides upgrades (e.g., .NET Framework to .NET 8, Java to Java 21+)
- Automates Dockerfile and cloud configuration generation
- Detects security issues and helps remediate
- Generates CI/CD pipelines for GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps
- Offers explainable pull request refactoring assistance

### Azure Migrate

- AI-powered, agentless discovery for a full inventory of IT assets
- Automated dependency mapping using telemetry
- Cloud readiness assessments and risk identification
- Azure landing zone recommendations aligned with the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
- Infrastructure-as-code templates in ARM, Bicep, Terraform
- AI-driven migration “waves” for sequencing and efficiency

### Azure Copilot

- AI-driven recommendations for cloud operations, optimization, and governance
- Extends agentic intelligence to ongoing management of cloud environments

## Tangible Results Achieved

- Upgrade cycle times cut by 3-4x with AI-driven tools
- 60–70% reduction in modernization effort, especially with Java/.NET and middleware
- Startups and small teams see 60%+ workload reductions on migrations/refactoring
- Higher quality and safety via automated best practices, testing, and dependency checks

## The Agentic DevOps Evolution

- Collapses silos between modernization, development, and cloud operations
- Offers speed, safety, and consistency via automation and intelligent guidance
- Makes modernization accessible for teams without specialized cloud-native expertise
- Empowers developers to focus on innovation over manual rote tasks

## Getting Started

- Explore Microsoft Learn’s modernization content: [Microsoft Learn – Azure Migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/topics/azure-migration/)
- Run Azure Migrate assessments for inventories and readiness reports
- Pilot GitHub Copilot modernization on non-critical apps
- Utilize CAF-aligned Azure landing zone templates
- Pursue certifications like Azure Solutions Architect and Azure DevOps Engineer for team skill growth

Modernizing for the AI era is achievable and less daunting with Microsoft’s agentic toolchain. These tools enable organizations to transition legacy systems to intelligent, cloud-ready architectures, laying the groundwork for continuous innovation.
