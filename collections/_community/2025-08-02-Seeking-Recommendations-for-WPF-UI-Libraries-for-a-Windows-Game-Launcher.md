Author kkassius_ seeks community advice on selecting a WPF UI library to use in their Windows game launcher project, sharing initial goals, challenges, and future customization plans.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

kkassius_ discusses their task of building a Windows-only game launcher using WPF and seeks input on which WPF UI library would be suitable for the project. The author has basic familiarity with WPF and XAML but lacks confidence from prior projects.

### Project Background

- The author is working in a small team and has been assigned to create a game launcher for Windows.
- Their initial preference was to use Blazor Hybrid and MAUI for potential styling transfers from the existing frontend.
- Blazor Hybrid and MAUI were abandoned due to problematic window management (custom window styles, resizing, etc.) on Windows.
- The project requirements include the capability to apply themes and, eventually, rewrite/customize some UI components.

### Current Focus

- The project is moving forward with WPF.
- The author needs guidance on selecting a suitable WPF UI library, with at least basic theming support, while planning for future, more extensive customizations.
- Functionality such as client updates and authentication are part of the launcher’s requirements.

### Community Call

- The post is a request for suggestions and experiences regarding WPF UI libraries, especially those that balance ease of use with flexibility for later customization.
