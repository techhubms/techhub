# Azure Copilot Observability Agent: AI-Driven Investigations for Cloud Operations

## Overview

Cloud environments demand intelligent, scalable observability solutions. The Azure Copilot observability agent delivers this, building on Azure Monitor’s investigation capabilities and using AI, machine learning, and LLMs to automate problem isolation and root cause analysis.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Problem Isolation:** Quickly detects and isolates issues across complex applications and infrastructure.
- **AI and ML-Driven Insights:** Utilizes anomaly detection, data correlation, and large language models to uncover causes and provide clear, actionable findings.
- **Integrated Experience:** Access through Azure alerts, Azure portal, and Copilot interface for seamless workflows.
- **Full-Stack Coverage:** Supports Azure services from application layer to infrastructure, including VMs and AKS clusters.
- **Collaboration and Tracking:** Investigation results can be preserved for team collaboration and historical analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Alert-Based Trigger:** Start investigations directly from Azure alert notifications by clicking 'Investigate'.
2. **AI-Generated Findings:** The agent surfaces potential root causes with supporting data, so you can troubleshoot quickly.
3. **Multi-Source Correlation:** Combines metrics, logs, and resource health information for contextualized insights.
4. **Resource Diagnostics Integration:** Built-in tools facilitate validation and remediation without leaving the investigative workflow.

## Example Use Cases

- **AKS Diagnostics:** Spot abnormal pod restarts and correlate with infrastructure health.
- **VM Monitoring:** Analyze metric anomalies (CPU, memory) and validate using real-time health checks.
- **Log-Based Metric Analysis:** Contextualize metrics with log data for precise diagnostics.

## Availability and Getting Started

- Available in preview in most Azure regions.
- Integrated with Azure Copilot (gated preview), Azure alerting, and Azure Monitor.
- Access documentation and deep-dive resources for setup and best practices:
  - [Azure Copilot observability agent docs](https://aka.ms/investigationmanuals)
  - [Best practices blog](https://aka.ms/IssueBlogIgnite25)
  - [Sign up for new preview features](https://forms.office.com/r/m5K2DcLkdF)

## Next Steps

- **Interact Naturally:** Use Copilot’s conversational functionality for investigating and resolving alerts.
- **Future capabilities** include deeper agentic reasoning and expanded scenario support.
- Stay tuned for updates via Ignite sessions and webinars.

## Feedback

Microsoft encourages user feedback via <azmoninvestigation@microsoft.com> and the product feedback form.
