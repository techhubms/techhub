# Streamline Load Testing with AI-Assisted Authoring in Azure App Testing

**Author:** Nikita_Nallamothu  

AI-assisted load test authoring in Azure App Testing enables developers to create and improve load tests more quickly and efficiently. Instead of lengthy manual scripting, you can now use a browser extension to record user journeys, which the AI then analyzes to generate ready-to-run JMeter scripts tailored for realistic, scalable performance testing.

## Key Benefits

- **Accelerated Test Creation:** Record real user journeys in your browser (Edge or Chrome) and skip hours of manual scripting.
- **AI-Driven Enhancements:** AI analyzes your recordings, automatically recommending best practices, such as:
  - Adding smart labels for easier script interpretation
  - Applying think times based on user interactions
  - Suggesting correlations for dynamic data
  - Identifying parameterization opportunities for simulating diverse users and inputs
- **Customization and Control:** You maintain full oversight and can accept, edit, or dismiss AI’s recommendations, and continue manual script fine-tuning as needed.
- **Scalable Execution:** Easily configure test parameters (load, ramp-up, duration) and run large-scale load tests using Azure Load Testing.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Install the Azure App Testing browser extension** for Edge or Chrome: [Get the extension](https://aka.ms/AppTesting/Browser-Ext).
2. **Record a user journey** within your application.
3. **Upload the recording** to Azure Load Testing.
4. **AI processes the recording,** providing actionable script enhancement suggestions.
5. **Review, apply, or adjust recommendations**—or skip them to keep full control over your scripts.
6. **Download the generated JMeter script** for additional customization if needed.
7. **Run your load test at scale** to obtain meaningful and actionable performance insights.

## Why Use AI-Assisted Load Test Authoring?

- **Save time:** Reduce manual scripting from hours to minutes.
- **Boost test realism:** Incorporate real user behaviors into your tests.
- **Improve script quality:** Leverage AI's suggested best practices to avoid common pitfalls.
- **Maintain flexibility:** You always remain in control over your scripts and test parameters.

## Getting Started

- **Try it now:** Install the browser extension and begin recording user journeys.
- **Learn more:** [Read the documentation](https://aka.ms/AppTesting/AIAuthoring)
- **Feedback:** Share what works and what could improve in the [developer community](https://aka.ms/malt-feedback) or via in-product options. Your feedback shapes the future of AI-assisted load testing in Azure.
