## Ace Aviator of the Month

**November’s Ace Aviator: Al Ghoniem** (`Senior Integration Consultant, ARINCO`)

- **Role & Responsibilities:** Designs and delivers integrations using Logic Apps Standard, API Management, Service Bus, Event Grid, and Azure Functions. Drives reference architectures, reusable templates (Bicep, YAML), reliability, and cost-efficiency across projects. Mentors teams and fosters standardization and quality.
- **Daily Activities:** Works on architecture and solution patterns, builds reusable automation (Logic Apps, Bicep, pipelines), tackles challenging integration problems (faults, retries, monitoring), leads technical enablement, and shares insights with the community.
- **Professional Growth:** Leverages feedback loops (telemetry, post-incident reviews), creates reusable scaffolding (golden templates), emphasizes cross-discipline skills (architecture, DevOps, FinOps, AI), and believes in teaching and mentoring as a means to mastery.
- **Wish List for Logic Apps:** Proposes first-class "Stateful Sessions and Decisions"—built-in session management, native decisioning with auditing, and developer-first local workflows to empower complex orchestration scenarios.
