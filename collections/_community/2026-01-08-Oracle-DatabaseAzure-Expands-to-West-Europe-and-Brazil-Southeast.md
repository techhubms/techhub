# Oracle Database@Azure Expands to West Europe and Brazil Southeast

**Author:** SparshAgrawat

## Overview

The global expansion of Oracle Database@Azure is now underway, with new regional availability in West Europe (Netherlands) and Brazil Southeast (Rio de Janeiro). This enables customers to deploy AI and data-intensive workloads closer to their users while addressing data residency, sovereignty, and compliance requirements specific to those geographies.

## New Regional Availability

- **West Europe (Netherlands):** Customers in Europe now benefit from localized data hosting, improved compliance, and lower latency.
- **Brazil Southeast (Rio de Janeiro):** Compliments the existing Brazil South region and enhances business continuity and disaster recovery within Brazil.
- **Current Global Footprint:** Oracle Database@Azure is now present in over 30 Azure regions including North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.

## Technical Migration and Integration

- **Seamless Oracle-to-Azure Migration:** Customers can migrate Oracle databases to Azure without major code changes or re-architecture using Oracle Zero Downtime Migration.
- **Unified, AI-Ready Platform:** The solution uses Oracle Exadata infrastructure directly in Azure datacenters, supporting ultra-low latency and high performance for mission-critical workloads.
- **Service Integration:** Azure services such as Microsoft Fabric, Copilot Studio, and Azure App Service are natively accessible alongside Oracle Database. This integration supports a variety of AI-driven analytics and intelligent application workloads.
- **Licensing Flexibility:** Bring Your Own License (BYOL) and license-included options are both available.

## Compliance, Security, and Availability

- **Compliance:** Regional availability aids in meeting data residency and regulatory requirements for sensitive industries.
- **Security:** The solution leverages Azure-native identity (Microsoft Entra ID), security (Microsoft Defender for Cloud), monitoring (Azure Monitor), and networking capabilities.
- **High Availability:** Architectural support for Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) Silver and Gold deployment patterns, combined with Azure Availability Zones, ensures resilience and business continuity.
