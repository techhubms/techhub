# Azure Networking 2025: Powering Cloud Innovation and AI at Global Scale

By Sudha_Mahajan

## Introduction

In 2025, Azure’s networking platform played a foundational role in supporting global-scale cloud innovation, with a particular focus on high-bandwidth AI workloads and secure, resilient hybrid connectivity. A major highlight was the Fairwater AI datacenter in Wisconsin, designed to host hundreds of thousands of GPUs and requiring a single, flat, ultra-fast network fabric capable of 800 Gbps per link. This architecture enabled 10× the performance of previous supercomputing standards and demonstrated the critical importance of networking for both AI and traditional enterprise cloud needs.

## Meeting AI and Hybrid Demands

With the rapid adoption of AI workloads and data-driven applications, Azure responded by expanding its networking capabilities:

- **ExpressRoute Direct** now supports 400 Gbps ports (available in 2026), enabling enterprises and HPC clusters to transfer massive data volumes securely and with low latency. These can be aggregated into multi-terabit links for further scalability.
- **Azure VPN Gateway** achieved up to 20 Gbps aggregate throughput per gateway and 5 Gbps per tunnel, removing bottlenecks for remote sites and branch offices. This allows for high-speed, seamless connections during large-scale data migrations or distributed AI processing.
- Improvements to these connectivity solutions support hybrid scenarios, resilient architectures, and AI integration between on-premises and Azure environments.

## Simplified Global Networking

- **Azure Virtual WAN (vWAN):** Enhanced to offer forced tunneling for Secure Virtual Hubs, now in preview. This allows organizations to route Internet-bound traffic through a central security hub, simplifying backhaul security models and enabling centralized firewalling or inspection.
- **Azure Route Server:** Now supports up to 500 virtual network (VNet) spokes per server, allowing larger, more complex hub-and-spoke topologies. Improved BGP route selection preferences enable optimal routing between ExpressRoute, VPN, and custom network appliances for better performance and cost control.

## Network Resilience and Reliability

- **ExpressRoute Resiliency Insights:** Newly available tools provide resiliency scores and recommendations based on architecture, highlighting suboptimal arrangements and offering simulated failover tests. This proactive monitoring helps customers achieve always-on connectivity, even during physical disruptions.

## Security and Governance

- **DNS Security Policies with Threat Intelligence (GA):** Azure DNS integrates live threat intelligence, automatically blocking or redirecting DNS requests to known malware or phishing domains. This “cloud-delivered DNS firewall” enables enterprise-grade protection with minimal customer configuration.
- **Network Traffic Governance:** The introduction of forced tunneling in Secure Virtual Hubs helps facilitate compliance and centralized security controls across hybrid environments, supporting zero trust initiatives and simplifying governance.

## Cloud-Native and Edge Optimization

- **DNS Intelligent Traffic Control (preview):** New features prevent data exfiltration, apply custom recursion policies, and enhance security in name resolution for both cloud-native and edge deployments.
- **Azure Traffic Manager:** Upgraded for reliability and deeper integration with container-based and edge applications.

## AI-Driven Networking and Management

- **AI-powered features:** AI is now both a driving workload and an enabler within Azure Networking. Azure Copilot for networking accelerates routine tasks, provides instant best practice guidance, and simplifies troubleshooting through conversational interfaces. This democratizes expert-level networking management and helps teams handle sophisticated infrastructures with ease.

## Looking Ahead

The convergence of Azure’s robust networking stack and AI continues to define the future of cloud computing. Microsoft’s investments in higher speed, greater reliability, tighter security, and intelligent management tools make Azure a compelling platform for any organization seeking to build, scale, and secure cloud and hybrid infrastructure—effectively laying the groundwork for global, real-time, AI-powered applications and business models.
