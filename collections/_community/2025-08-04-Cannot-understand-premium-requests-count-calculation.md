FeelingResolution806 raises concerns about how premium requests in the GitHub Copilot subscription are counted and exhausted rapidly, questioning the underlying calculation and value.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

FeelingResolution806 shares their experience and confusion regarding the calculation of premium requests in a GitHub Copilot subscription. According to the post, their allocation of premium requests was depleted within just two days, leaving them without access to certain AI models (such as anthropic or Google models) for the remainder of the billing period. The user expresses uncertainty about what constitutes a 'premium request' and questions the fairness and value of the current quota system given the $10 subscription price.

## Key Points

- **Rapid Exhaustion:** Premium requests are being used up within two days of the start of the billing cycle, resulting in no access to additional models for the remaining 28 days.
- **Unclear Calculation:** The author is unsure how tasks are quantified as one premium request or on what basis the consumption occurs.
- **Model Restriction:** Once the quota is reached, models like anthropic or Google become inaccessible for the rest of the month.
- **Pricing Concerns:** For a $10 subscription, the author feels that the quota is insufficient.

## Discussion Points

The post invites further clarity from GitHub or the Copilot community regarding:

- The specific methodology behind request counting.
- Whether certain usage patterns exhaust the quota more quickly.
- If there are settings or usage strategies to optimize request allocation.
