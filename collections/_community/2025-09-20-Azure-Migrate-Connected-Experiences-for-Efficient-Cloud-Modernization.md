# Azure Migrate: Connected Experiences for Efficient Cloud Modernization

**Author:** Shiva Shastri, Sr Product Marketing Manager, Azure Migrate—Product & Ecosystem

## Modernization in Motion

Modernization means transforming legacy IT systems into architectures and technologies that increase agility, scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency. It is a continual journey, not a single project, enabling organizations to respond rapidly to changes in technology, customer needs, and the competitive landscape.

Azure, with its cloud-native patterns, supports modernization while offering access to innovations like AI, ultimately driving both technical and strategic business value.

## Overview of Azure Migrate

Azure Migrate is Microsoft’s unified, no-cost platform for cloud migration and modernization. Key capabilities include:

- IT resource discovery
- Assessment and business case analysis
- Planning and execution of migration
- Unified management and monitoring in a secure portal

With Azure Migrate, migrations become structured, trackable, and secure.

## New Features & Capabilities

### Accelerated Migration and Modernization

- **Agentic Method**: Azure Migrate uses AI-assisted analysis to assess on-premises environments, identify dependencies, and orchestrate workload migrations with minimal manual effort. This reduces risk and time-to-value for organizations.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- IaC support enables automation of infrastructure provisioning directly through code for repeatability and precision.
- Facilitates smooth transitions from legacy to cloud-native architectures and can replicate infrastructure configurations efficiently.

### Platform-Centric, Comprehensive Coverage

- Azure Migrate integrates with specialized tools, including Database Migration Service (DMS) and GitHub Copilot, providing flexibility across the IT estate.
- **6R Analysis** (Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild, Replace, Retire) enables customized modernization per application.
- Supports hybrid/multi-cloud scenarios with Arc-enabled resources and assessments for open-source stacks (including Rocky Linux and PostgreSQL).

## Security by Design

- The new **friction-free collector** secures data collection for migration assessment and reduces setup risk and complexity.
- Implements private networking (Private Link) and disabling of public network access for secure migration traffic.
- Enforces data encryption (in transit/at rest), supports customer-managed keys, and integrates with Azure Key Vault for credential security.
- Generates security vulnerability reports that align with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, enabling preemptive remediation and strong posture management from migration through to cloud operation.

## Sustainability Considerations

Azure Migrate provides carbon optimization analytics so IT teams understand potential for reducing emissions and cost, aligning with environmentally-conscious cloud strategies.
