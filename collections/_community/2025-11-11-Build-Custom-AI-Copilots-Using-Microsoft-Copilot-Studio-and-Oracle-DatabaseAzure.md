# Build Custom AI Copilots Using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Oracle Database@Azure

Enterprises running mission-critical workloads on Oracle Databases can now modernize and innovate directly on the Microsoft Cloud by leveraging [Oracle Database@Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/oracle/oracle-db/database-overview). This integration allows organizations to benefit from Oracle's reliability combined with Azure's scalability, security, and AI-driven capabilities.

## Bringing AI Copilots to Enterprise Data

With [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio), organizations can build custom AI copilots that:

- Securely connect to live Oracle data
- Offer natural language access for deriving insights and actions
- Integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365, or other business applications

### Data Modernization Meets Intelligent Experience

Oracle Database@Azure provides flexible hosting for Oracle workloads using services like Exadata, Autonomous, Exascale, or Base Database—without compromising performance or compliance. Copilot Studio is the bridge, enabling conversational access to structured Oracle data and fostering dynamic AI-driven dialogue over static reports.

## Enterprise-Grade Security and Compliance

Every copilot created in Copilot Studio automatically adopts Microsoft's governance and security models:

- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Enables Multi-Factor Authentication, conditional access, and identity management.
- **Microsoft Purview**: Extends data governance via sensitivity labels, DLP policies, and audit trails for AI engagements.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Allows detailed control over copilot creation, modification, and publishing.
- **Microsoft Defender and Sentinel**: Monitor Oracle Database@Azure environments for threats and enable proactive incident detection and response.

These layers protect sensitive data, support compliance, and are essential for regulated industries.

## Quickstart: Oracle Data-Powered Copilot in Copilot Studio

1. **Create Copilot**: Open Copilot Studio and select “New Agent”.
2. **Connect Oracle as Knowledge Source**: Add the Oracle connection securely and choose relevant tables. The copilot is then grounded in real business data.
3. **Define Topics and Prompts**: Map conversational prompts to live data queries.
4. **Apply Governance**: Use Purview labels and Entra ID policies.
5. **Publish Copilot**: Deploy directly to Teams or Microsoft 365 for rapid access.

## Example—Sales Insights Copilot

A finance team can quickly create a "Sales Insights Copilot" that answers questions like "What are the top five regions driving profit growth this quarter?" The copilot retrieves secure data from Oracle, honors governance controls, and delivers instant answers inside Teams or Microsoft 365—with no need for manual reports.

## Why This Integration Matters

By uniting Oracle Database@Azure and Microsoft Copilot Studio, organizations can:

- Achieve low-latency, high-performance Oracle workloads on Azure
- Develop conversational AI copilots drawing from real-time Oracle data
- Ensure privacy, security, and compliance through Microsoft governance (Purview, Entra ID, RBAC)
- Transform enterprise data workflows with intelligent, scalable solutions
