# Azure Communication Services Now Generally Available in Azure Government

Azure Communication Services (ACS) is now generally available within the Azure Government cloud, expanding its secure video and chat capabilities to U.S. government agencies and their partners. ACS empowers agencies to:

- **Enhance citizen experiences** by enabling secure video appointments, real-time case updates, and virtual assistance for greater accessibility.
- **Support mission-critical operations** with remote collaboration for defense, justice, and healthcare agencies, maintaining high security standards.

- **Ensure regulatory compliance** by inheriting critical certifications, including FedRAMP High.

## Why This Matters

Agencies are challenged to deliver services faster, more securely, and inclusively. By leveraging ACS in Azure Government, organizations can modernize engagement, empower employees, and ensure robust outcomes for citizens and mission partners.
