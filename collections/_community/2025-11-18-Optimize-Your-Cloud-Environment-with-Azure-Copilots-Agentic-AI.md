# Optimize Your Cloud Environment with Azure Copilot's Agentic AI

Azure Copilot is evolving with new agentic capabilities to help IT professionals, developers, and FinOps teams efficiently manage and optimize their cloud environments. Announced at Ignite 2025, the optimization agent within Azure Copilot offers a sophisticated set of tools for identifying, validating, and acting on cost savings and sustainability opportunities.

## Key Benefits

- **Unified Monitoring**: The operations center in the Azure Portal lets users monitor cloud spend and carbon emissions together, surfacing critical optimization actions.
- **Cost and Sustainability Insights**: The optimization agent evaluates both financial and carbon impacts of recommended changes, enabling well-informed decisions.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Each recommendation includes supporting evidence, utilization trends, and alternative SKU choices. Step-by-step guidance accelerates implementation and reduces manual effort.
- **Automation Support**: For technical teams, the agent automatically generates Azure CLI and PowerShell scripts so actions can be executed in the portal or integrated into larger workflows.
- **Collaborative Governance**: Teams across engineering, finance, procurement, and sustainability gain visibility and control over cloud resources, helping ensure compliance and eliminating inefficiencies.

## Example Workflow for FinOps Teams

Consider a scenario where development VMs have been left running, accumulating costs and carbon footprint. The optimization agent surfaces this issue, suggests resizing or shutting down idle resources, provides usage data with financial and environmental impact, and generates scripts to automate the process. Actions taken are logged for audit, ensuring transparency and corporate compliance.

## Why These Innovations Matter

- **Predictable Costs**: Copilot centralizes cost visibility across subscriptions and projects to help teams avoid overspending.
- **Resource Optimization**: Underutilized resources are quickly identified and addressed.
- **Operational Simplicity**: The agentic, unified interface lowers complexity even for large organizations.
