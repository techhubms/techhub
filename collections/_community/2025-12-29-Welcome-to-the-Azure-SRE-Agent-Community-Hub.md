Mayunk_Jain announces the launch of the Azure SRE Agent Community Hub—a space where engineers and developers can collaborate, discuss, and learn about Azure SRE Agent.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Welcome to the Azure SRE Agent Community Hub

If you’re building, running, or breaking things with **Azure SRE Agent**, this space is designed for you.

We’re excited to introduce the **Azure SRE Agent Community Hub**—a new forum for developers and reliability engineers to share ideas, ask questions, and help each other grow. You can join the conversation here: [https://aka.ms/sreagent/discussions](https://aka.ms/sreagent/discussions).

This hub is not just an announcement board or a place for perfect presentations. It’s an open, practical discussion environment driven by real-world community feedback and experiences. Whether you’re just starting with SRE Agent or exploring advanced usage, your contributions add value.

If you have a question the documentation didn’t answer, post it. If you’ve found a useful trick or workaround, share it. Testing something new and want advice? Start a thread and invite input from peers.

Keep in mind, the quality of this hub depends on the activity and engagement of its members. So don’t hesitate—share your thoughts early and often, and join conversations even if you’re not completely sure of your answer. Your input can help others or start valuable new discussions.

We especially invite **community champions**—people who support others, share their learning journeys, and help guide the direction of Azure SRE Agent.

If you know others working with Azure SRE Agent, bring them in. More voices mean richer conversations and better learning for everyone.

Stay updated on deep-dive stories, product news, and user cases through the dedicated blog: [http://aka.ms/sreagent/blogs](http://aka.ms/sreagent/blogs).

See you in the discussions—and welcome to the community! 🚀
