# Chart Your AI App and Agent Strategy with Microsoft Marketplace

Organizations exploring AI apps and agents face the fundamental challenge of whether to build, buy, or blend their solutions. There is no universal answer—each method comes with specific advantages and trade-offs:

- **Build**: Full customization and control, but requires significant time and resources.
- **Buy**: Fast adoption and proven reliability, but may involve trade-offs in flexibility.
- **Blend**: Combination of custom and off-the-shelf solutions to balance agility and control.
