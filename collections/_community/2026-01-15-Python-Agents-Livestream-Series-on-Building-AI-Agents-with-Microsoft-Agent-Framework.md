# Python + Agents: Livestream Series on Building AI Agents with Microsoft Agent Framework

**Presented by: Pamela Fox**

Join this six-part livestream series to accelerate your understanding and skills in building modern AI agents using Python and Microsoft's open-source Agent Framework. The sessions cater to beginners and experienced developers who want hands-on exposure to agent concepts, practical coding, and best practices for production-quality AI-driven systems. Each session features live coding, detailed Q&A opportunities, and links to further resources.

## What You'll Learn

- The anatomy of an AI agent, how to structure and register tools for them
- How to connect agents to local MCP (Microsoft Common Platform) servers
- Incorporating memory (short-term and persistent) and context (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) into agents
- Real-world techniques for observing, monitoring, and evaluating agents using tools like OpenTelemetry and the Azure AI Evaluation SDK
- Architecting simple and advanced agent-driven workflows, including multi-agent and concurrent orchestration with frameworks like Magentic
- Designing Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) workflows to allow for human approvals, checkpoints, and error recovery
- Debugging and visualizing agents and workflows with DevUI and Aspire Dashboard

Throughout, all examples will use Python. Resources and code samples will be provided so attendees can follow along or experiment later.
