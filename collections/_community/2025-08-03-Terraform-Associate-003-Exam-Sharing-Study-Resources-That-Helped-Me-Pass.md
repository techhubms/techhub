## Terraform Associate (003) Exam – Sharing Study Resources That Helped Me Pass

**Author: AndroCentauri**

Preparing for the **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003)** certification can seem overwhelming, especially for those new to infrastructure as code or the Terraform tool itself. Based on my own experience passing the exam, here are the most useful resources and strategies that I found invaluable to my study process.

### 🎥 Free Video Tutorials

- **SuperInnovaTech**: Exam preparation with real-world demos, such as provisioning a simple website on AWS using Terraform.
- **FreeCodeCamp**: Offers a full-length Terraform Associate Course tailored to version 003.
- **Cloud Champ**: Features video explanations that break down practice exam questions and logic.
- **DevOps Directive**: Presents a thorough overview of Terraform fundamentals, covering the breadth of exam topics.

### 📘 Practice Exams (Udemy)

Practice exams are instrumental in understanding both the technical concepts and the typical structure of exam questions. The Udemy course "Terraform Practice Exams" by Muhammad Saad Sarwar includes three full-length practice exams and is frequently discounted (usually available for under $15 with a code).

### 🔗 Official Guide

The [HashiCorp Certification Overview & Study Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/certification/terraform-associate) is the authoritative source for exam topics and includes hands-on labs, study guides, and a clear exam overview. It’s highly recommended to use the official guide as your main reference point.

### 💻 Hands-on Practice

Video content and practice exams provide knowledge and familiarity, but hands-on experience with Terraform is essential:

- Practice writing real Terraform configuration files.
- Deploy resources, especially in the AWS free tier, to gain practical experience.
- Experiment with modules, state management, and remote backends.
- Try using mocks and various scenarios to reinforce your learning.

Combining hands-on experimentation with structured mock exams solidifies understanding and increases confidence for the actual test.

### 💡 Extra Tip

If buying Udemy courses, check for monthly discount codes like `AUG25` or `AUG2025`, which can often lower course costs to under $15.
