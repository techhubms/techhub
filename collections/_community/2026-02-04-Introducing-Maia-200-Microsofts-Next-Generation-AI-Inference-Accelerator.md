# Introducing Maia 200: Microsoft’s Next-Generation AI Inference Accelerator

In the latest advancement of AI infrastructure, Microsoft has unveiled the Maia 200—a purpose-built inference accelerator set to enhance AI token generation efficiency across Azure's cloud ecosystem.

## Maia 200 Highlights

- **Breakthrough inference silicon** engineered for Azure AI workloads, supporting scalable high-performance acceleration.
- Focused on improving the economics of large-scale AI deployments.

## Technical Deep Dive and Community Engagement

Microsoft is sharing extensive technical insights and showcasing Maia 200 via several key events:

### ISSCC 2026 Whitepaper

- Microsoft submitted a technical whitepaper, *“Maia: A Reticle-Scale AI Accelerator”* by Sherry Xu (Partner, Silicon Architecture), to the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC).
- The paper covers Maia 200’s architecture and reticle-limited design, including innovations enabling a ~750W AI SoC for scalable performance.
- Release: February 13, 2026 (ISSCC attendees first, then public on IEEE).

### ISSCC Conference Session

- Microsoft Azure Hardware & Systems leaders will present "MAIA: A Reticle-Scale AI Accelerator" at ISSCC Session 17.4.
- Time: 2:45 PM, as part of the “Highlighted Chip Releases for AI” in the Marriott Marquis, San Francisco.
- The talk walks through Maia 200’s architecture, design motivations, and the process of delivering cutting-edge AI silicon.

### Microsoft Silicon Social Event

- Evening of February 17, 2026, hosted in downtown San Francisco.
- First public appearance of Maia 200 outside Microsoft labs and Azure datacenters.
- Attendees can meet Microsoft’s silicon engineering leadership and see various hardware innovations.
- Registration is open to ISSCC attendees and the Bay Area silicon community. Space is limited; guests will receive follow-up details via email.
