**Author:** AnaviNahar  
**Published:** September 10, 2025

Automatic Identity Management (AIM) for Microsoft Entra ID on Azure Databricks is now generally available, streamlining identity and access management for organizations using Azure Databricks.

## Key Improvements

- **No Manual Setup Needed:** Users, groups, and service principals from Microsoft Entra ID are automatically available within Azure Databricks workspaces. This eliminates manual administrative steps such as user import/export, group assignments, or custom SCIM configuration.

- **Default Enablement:** AIM is enabled by default for all new Azure Databricks accounts. Existing accounts can enable it with a single click in the Account Admin Console, and soon, all will have it enabled by default.
- **Automation at Scale:** Register users, groups, and service principals via APIs, supporting automation and script-based processes for large enterprises.

## Benefits

- **Support for Nested Groups:** Integrated handling of complex organizational structures, including nested group memberships.
- **Enterprise-Grade Access Control:** Leverage Microsoft's trusted Entra ID identity platform for robust security and compliance.
