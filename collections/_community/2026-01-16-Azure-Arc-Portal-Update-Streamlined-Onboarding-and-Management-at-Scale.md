# Azure Arc Portal Update: Streamlined Onboarding and Management at Scale

*By Jisu Park, Aaron Woods, George Enninful — Shared by MarcoB*

Azure Arc brings Azure's management capabilities to resources running across on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments. The Azure Arc portal serves as the central hub for discovering, onboarding, organizing, and managing these external assets just like native Azure resources.

## Major Updates in the Azure Arc Portal

### Improved Learnability and Discoverability

- **Redesigned Landing Page**: Onboarding options are now easier to compare, helping users quickly identify the right approach for their scenario.
- **Guided Onboarding**: An interactive questionnaire delivers tailored recommendations whether onboarding a small number of machines or scaling across multiple environments.
- **Refreshed Navigation**: The menu bar has been reorganized for more intuitive access to key Arc capabilities based on common user jobs.

### Unified Machine Onboarding Flow

- Previously, various onboarding methods led to complexity and confusion. Now, a single unified flow collects contextual information as you go, making the experience more consistent across all machine types and environments.

### Enhanced Actionable Dashboards

- **Adaptive Summary Cards**: The dashboard surfaces service capability cards that respond dynamically to your configuration, providing relevant call-to-action prompts.
- **Actionable Control Panel**: Agent Connectivity, Secure Score, and Policy Compliance are now displayed in updated, clearer tiles. Improved call-to-action logic turns the panel into an actionable workspace for admins.

## Why These Changes Matter

Hybrid and multi-cloud environments introduce complexity. This portal refresh aims to make management more intuitive and actionable, allowing organizations to focus less on technical hurdles and more on delivering business value.
