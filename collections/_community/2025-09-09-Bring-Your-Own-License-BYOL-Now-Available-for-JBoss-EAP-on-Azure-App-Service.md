# Bring Your Own License (BYOL) Now Available for JBoss EAP on Azure App Service

**Author:** Byron Tardif

Azure App Service now supports Bring Your Own License (BYOL) for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP), giving enterprise customers new flexibility for deploying Java workloads in the cloud.

## What Is BYOL for JBoss EAP?

BYOL lets customers with existing Red Hat subscriptions use those licenses for JBoss EAP deployments on Azure App Service. This provides an alternative to the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) model, helping organizations manage their licensing costs and maintain consistency between cloud and on-premises environments.

### Benefits of BYOL

- Use current Red Hat licenses on Azure App Service
- Bypass built-in PAYG license fees
- Take advantage of Red Hat Cloud Access entitlements
- Align Azure licensing with existing contracts

## Why This Matters

JBoss EAP is used for critical enterprise applications. Previously, Azure App Service customers needed to use PAYG licensing, which could be costly for large deployments. With BYOL, organizations can:

- Lower the total cost of running JBoss EAP workloads
- Enable license portability from on-prem to cloud via Red Hat Cloud Access
- Simplify compliance and budgeting for cloud adoption

## Supported Hosting Options

BYOL support applies to:

- Azure App Service (new support)
- Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Azure Red Hat OpenShift

This feature is a result of collaboration between Microsoft and Red Hat.

## Summary

BYOL for JBoss EAP on Azure App Service helps organizations modernize Java applications on Azure while keeping existing Red Hat licensing investments. Whether migrating from on-prem or scaling new apps, BYOL offers flexibility and cost optimization to support enterprise cloud journeys.
