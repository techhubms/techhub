# Enhancing Azure Data Management with Silk Software-Defined Storage and Silk Echo for AI

**Co-authored by Silk**

Data agility and resilience are paramount for modern enterprises leveraging Microsoft Azure. In this article, silk’s software-defined storage platform and the new Silk Echo for AI are presented as powerful solutions for maximizing performance, optimizing resource use, and enabling advanced AI, analytics, and database scenarios in the cloud.

## Key Challenges in Cloud Data Management

When migrating workloads such as SQL Server, Oracle, or DB2 to Azure, organizations often encounter:

- **Performance bottlenecks** due to cloud storage limitations
- **Data copy proliferation** for non-production environments
- **Operational overhead** tied to backups, refreshes, and storage management

## Silk’s Platform: Software-Defined Storage on Azure

- **Runs on Azure IaaS** as a performance-optimized data layer
- Harnesses Azure compute and native storage, including [L-series VMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes/storage-optimized/l-family) and NVMe
- Delivers up to 34GB/s throughput per VM
- Employs erasure coding for multi-zone resilience
- Provides inline deduplication and compression
- Enables zero-cost, autonomous snapshots and clones for rapid environment refreshes

## Silk Echo for AI: Next-Gen Copy Data Management

**Silk Echo for AI** adds intelligence via AI-powered data copy orchestration and management:

- **AI-driven recommendations** automate and optimize data snapshot and clone workflows
- **Instant, space-efficient cloning** reduces storage cost and accelerates dev/test
- **Cross-environment consistency** ensures reliable and synchronized copies
- **Policy-based lifecycle management** keeps data governance and compliance simple
- **Resource optimization** through deduplication and compression
- **AI/ML workflow enablement** by providing fresh, production-grade data clones to data science teams

## Real-World Example: Sentara Health

Migrating EHR and SQL Server workloads to Azure, [Sentara Health](https://silk.us/resources/sentara-healthcare/) drastically cut down environment refresh time from days/weeks to minutes. Development and data science teams benefit from rapid self-service access to production-grade data clones, supporting faster iteration and reliable model training, all running on resilient Azure-powered infrastructure.

## Silk and Microsoft: Joint Value

- **Data-as-a-Service**: Gives DevOps, DataOps, and AI/ML teams on-demand access to up-to-date snapshots
- **AI-ready Infrastructure**: AI/ML supports predictive issue mitigation and real-time inferencing over operational data
- **Lower Costs**: Storage optimization and reduced manual intervention
- **Seamless Cloud Migrations**: Migrates tier 1 workloads to Azure with minimal refactoring
