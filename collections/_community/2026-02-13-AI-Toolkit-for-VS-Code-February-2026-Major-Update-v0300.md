# AI Toolkit for VS Code — February 2026 Update

**Author:** junjieli

## Major Milestone: v0.30.0

The February 2026 release of AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code delivers significant new features, making AI agent development more discoverable, debuggable, and production-ready. The update introduces a brand-new Tool Catalog, end-to-end Agent Inspector, and treating evaluations as full-fledged tests.

## 🔧 New in v0.30.0

### 🧰 Tool Catalog: Centralized Agent Tool Management

- Unified hub for discovering and managing agent tools.
- Browse, search, and filter tools from the public Foundry catalog and local stdio MCP servers.
- Configure connection settings for each tool directly in VS Code.
- Add tools to agents via the Agent Builder interface.
- Manage tool lifecycles (add, update, remove) within the editor.

### 🕵️ Agent Inspector: Enhanced Debugging

- Debug agents inside VS Code with one-click F5 support.
- Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through agent execution.
- Copilot auto-configuration scaffolds agent code, endpoints, and debugging setup.
- Generate production-ready code using the Hosted Agent SDK for Microsoft Foundry.
- Real-time visualization of responses, tool calls, and agent workflows.
- Rapid navigation—double-click workflow nodes to jump to the corresponding source code.
- Unified view combining workflow, chat, and visualization.

### 🧪 Evaluation as Tests: Developer-Friendly Quality Checks

- Define agent evaluations as test cases using familiar pytest syntax and Eval Runner SDK annotations.
- Run evaluations directly from the VS Code Test Explorer.
- Analyze evaluation results in a table view with Data Wrangler integration.
- Submit and run evaluation definitions at scale within Microsoft Foundry.
