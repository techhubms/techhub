# Announcing Foundry Control Plane Support for Logic Apps Agent Loop (Preview)

## Manage, Govern, and Observe Agents at Scale

At Ignite 2025, Microsoft unveiled the [Foundry Control Plane](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-foundry-blog/foundry-control-plane-where-developers-build-operate-and-govern-every-agent/4467885), enabling developers to build, operate, and govern AI agents from a single, centralized platform. Logic Apps Agent Loop implementations now fully participate in this governance experience, ensuring enterprise customers can leverage agent autonomy without sacrificing control or compliance.

Agent governance is foundational for trust, scalability, and responsible AI. As agents gain the ability to make decisions and execute tasks, robust governance safeguards organizations against unauthorized actions, regulatory issues, and operational risks. The Foundry Control Plane is designed to help enterprises meet these security and compliance requirements as they scale agent-powered applications.

## Preview Launch Details

- **Instant Logic Apps Agent Loop Integration**: No additional configuration is needed; Logic Apps Agent Loop instances automatically appear in your Foundry dashboard.
- **Access Steps**:
  - Go to [Foundry Control Plane](https://ai.azure.com/) and enable the new experience.
  - Select your Foundry project, click **Operate** at the top right.
  - Under **Assets**, choose your **Subscription** and set **Source** to "Logic Apps Agent Loop".
  - Your Agent Loop instances are now visible, with controls for stopping, starting, and deep-linking for further management.

## Roadmap: Telemetry & Conversation Insights

A future update will bring Agent Loop telemetry to Foundry Control Plane, providing rich monitoring:

- **Conversation Lists**: View token usage statistics for every conversation (inputs/outputs).
- **Execution Traces**: Examine specific trace instances for granular telemetry on agent behavior.
- **Pre-release Images**: Preview dashboards and insights from upcoming features.

## Video Demo

To see Foundry Control Plane and Logic Apps workflow in action, refer to the linked video demo for hands-on guidance.
