# Transforming City Operations: Edge RAG and Azure Arc in Villa Park

## Overview

The City of Villa Park, California, in collaboration with DataON and Microsoft, has implemented Edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizing Azure Arc and Foundry models. This project enables instant, context-rich, and resilient operational experiences, even regardless of network connectivity.

## Edge RAG Features Announced at Ignite 2025

- **LazyGraph RAG**: Advanced graph-based retrieval delivering higher-quality and more relevant inferencing.
- **High-Fidelity Parsing**: OCR support for documents, tables, and images for enhanced search capabilities.
- **SharePoint Server Integration**: Direct querying from Edge RAG over SharePoint data.
- **Multimodal Search**: Retrieve and process images, rich outputs, and text data.
- **Upgraded Chat UI**: Improved user experience for conversational AI interactions.
- **Fully Disconnected Scenarios**: Powered by Azure Local, allowing edge operations during network outages.

## Villa Park’s Smart City Blueprint

Challenges faced by Villa Park included complex zoning approvals, CEQA compliance bottlenecks, and ADU permit backlogs. Deploying Edge RAG on Azure Local resulted in:

- Rapid environmental assessments (days reduced to minutes).
- Automated end-to-end workflows for compliance and permitting.
- Conversational AI interfaces offering immediate, cited regulatory answers.
- Full offline operational support and digital resilience.
- A replicable model for other municipalities seeking modernization.

## Technical Highlights

### Deep Search Powered by LazyGraph RAG

Villa Park planners utilize dynamic, multi-document reasoning to address complex queries that span numerous regulatory areas. The system intelligently retrieves and combines information from varied sources in real time, reducing compute costs and latency.

### Advanced Document Parsing

- Ingests free-form text, tables, images, metadata
- Indexes tables with section context and page references
- Enables detailed, structured data search (e.g., permit statistics, impact scores)

### Enhanced Conversational AI

Staff can switch between data-grounded chat and model-only chat modes for general queries, training, or troubleshooting. This aids operational agility and onboarding.

### Agentic Workflows & Multimodal Innovations

- Autonomous workflow execution at the edge
- User-driven queries over SharePoint (private preview)
- Performance boosts: sub-15 second responses; 600-image batch in 36 seconds
- “Bring Your Own Model” support, including OpenAI GPT-4o and other advanced LLMs

## Security, Compliance, and Sustainability

- Data sovereignty: sensitive information remains on-premises
- Zero-trust architecture linked to Microsoft’s security stack
- Compliance-ready design supporting city, state, and industry regulations
- Energy-efficient edge hardware for a reduced carbon footprint

## Customer Feedback

**Ray Pascua (Planning Manager, Villa Park):**
AI-driven workflow automation delivers value to resource-limited agencies. While ongoing evolution is needed, the gains in efficiency for planning are substantial.

**Howard Lo (VP Sales & Marketing, DataON):**
Azure Local and Edge RAG proved practical AI value for public sector operations and offer a blueprint for similar deployments elsewhere.
