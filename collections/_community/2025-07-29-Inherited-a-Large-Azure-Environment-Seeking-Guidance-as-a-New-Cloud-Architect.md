Cybertron2600 discusses inheriting a sprawling Azure environment as a cloud architect and asks for advice on managing and understanding it.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Inheriting a Large Azure Environment: Navigating the Challenges

**Author:** Cybertron2600

Stepping into the role of cloud architect for an enterprise, the author describes inheriting a vast and disorganized Azure environment comprising around 50 subscriptions across various departments. Used to working in smaller, more structured Azure setups, the author is now faced with a blank slate in terms of team, processes, and governance.

### Initial Assessment and Main Challenge

The author’s main challenge is to take ownership of this cloud footprint. Their previous experience in professional services was largely focused on small and medium-sized companies, which did not prepare them for the scale and complexity encountered here. With numerous cloud-native applications and a multitude of stakeholders, the author is seeking the best place to start understanding and organizing the current Azure setup.

### Key Concerns Raised

- **Scope and Scale:** The Azure environment consists of approximately 50 subscriptions managed by different departments.
- **Governance & Processes:** There appears to be little to no existing structure, governance, or documented processes.
- **Ownership:** The author is eager to establish clarity and take control but is unsure of the right steps given the environment's current state.

### Request for Advice

Cybertron2600 asks the community how others would proceed if placed in a similar position. Specifically, they are seeking strategies and best practices for:

- Gaining visibility into all subscriptions and resources
- Introducing governance and organizational structure
- Establishing effective processes and teams for management
- Addressing cloud sprawl and normalizing resource configurations

The author hopes to leverage the community’s collective experience to develop a plan of action for transitioning the company from an unkempt cloud layout to a well-governed, secure, and manageable environment.
