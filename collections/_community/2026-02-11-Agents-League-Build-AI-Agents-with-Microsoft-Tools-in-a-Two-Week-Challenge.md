aycabas presents the Agents League, a two-week AI agent challenge where developers use Microsoft tools like GitHub Copilot, Foundry, and Copilot Studio to create innovative solutions and compete for prizes.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Agents League: Two Weeks, Three Tracks, One Challenge

Agents League is a two-week AI agent building competition running from February 16 to 27. Developers are challenged to build intelligent agents using production-ready Microsoft tools such as GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Foundry, and Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit or Copilot Studio. The event combines hands-on experience, live sessions, and community learning.

## Tracks & Tools

- **Creative Apps:** Utilize GitHub Copilot (Chat, CLI, or SDK) to build innovative, AI-assisted applications, including web, CLI tools, or games.
- **Reasoning Agents:** Leverage Microsoft Foundry (UI/SDK) or the Microsoft Agent Framework to create multi-agent systems with complex reasoning and planning abilities.
- **Enterprise Agents:** Use the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit or Copilot Studio to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot for real-world enterprise scenarios (bonus for MCP server integration, OAuth, Adaptive Cards, or multi-agent architectures).

## Event Schedule

- **Week 1 (Feb 17-19):** Live coding battles on Microsoft Reactor featuring product teams and community experts, each battle dedicated to one track. Recordings are available for asynchronous viewing.
- **Week 2 (Feb 24-26):** Focus on building your project and join AMA sessions on Discord for direct interaction with Microsoft experts. Share progress and get community feedback.
