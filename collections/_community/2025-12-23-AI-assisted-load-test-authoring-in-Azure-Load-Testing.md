# AI-assisted load test authoring in Azure Load Testing

## Overview

Creating reliable load tests for cloud applications can be complex and time-consuming. With the latest AI-driven enhancements in Azure Load Testing, developers can record real user journeys from browsers and instantly generate production-ready JMeter scripts with intelligent assistance, streamlining the entire authoring process.

## Key Features

- **Browser-based journey recording**: Use the [Azure App Testing browser extension](https://aka.ms/AppTesting/Browser-Ext) for Edge or Chrome to record actual user interactions.
- **AI-driven script enhancement**:
  - Smart labeling for clarity in scripts and test results
  - Automated think times reflecting true user patterns
  - Recommended correlations for dynamic values to avoid test flakiness at scale
  - Parameterization suggestions to simulate realistic data and user diversity
- **Iterative control**: Accept, edit, or ignore AI recommendations; manual fine-tuning remains fully supported.

## Steps to Author and Run a Load Test

1. **Install the Extension**: Add Azure App Testing to your browser.
2. **Record a User Journey**: Navigate your application to capture real usage.
3. **Upload & Enhance**: Upload your recording to Azure Load Testing; AI will analyze and suggest script improvements.
4. **Review and Customize**: Apply, adjust, or skip recommendations. Manually edit scripts as needed.
5. **Configure & Execute**: Set load profiles (ramp-up, duration) and launch tests at scale. Download auto-generated JMeter scripts for further customization if desired.
6. **Analyze Results**: Receive higher-quality insights into application performance thanks to AI recommendations and realistic user simulation.

## Benefits

- **Reduced manual effort** for building complex load tests
- **Higher-quality, more realistic scripts** reflecting true user behavior
- **Performance insights** that empower confident scaling decisions
- **Transparency and control** at every step
