# Applying DevOps Principles on Lean Infrastructure: Lessons from Scaling to 102,000 Users and Planning Azure Migration

**Author:** onoja5, Microsoft Certified DevOps Engineer and Azure Developer

## Overview

This post details the journey of building and scaling a social commerce platform in West Africa to 102,000 users, using core DevOps principles on a single VPS. It offers a practical perspective on infrastructure constraints, cost management, and hands-on optimization. The author is preparing a phased migration to Azure and asks the Azure community for insights on best practices, migration pain points, and operational wisdom.

## Current Infrastructure and Stack

- **Platform:** Social commerce
- **Region:** West Africa
- **Active Users:** 102,000
- **Monthly Events:** 2 million
- **Uptime:** 99.2%
- **Infrastructure:** Single VPS
- **Technology Stack:** PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Redis
- **DevOps Practices:** CI/CD using GitHub Actions, custom monitoring, automated rollbacks, feature flags, automated backups, infrastructure as code, automated testing

---

## Key DevOps Practices Put Into Action

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Weekly deployments with GitHub Actions
  - Zero-downtime deployment and automated health check rollbacks
  - Gradual feature rollout with feature flags
- **Monitoring & Observability:**
  - Custom monitoring and performance tracking
  - Real-time alerts and resource usage monitoring
- **Automation:**
  - Automated backups, database optimization, image compression, and security updates
- **Infrastructure as Code:**
  - Configuration and deployment scripts stored in Git
  - Documented procedures
- **Testing & Quality:**
  - Automated test suite, pre-deployment health checks, staging environment
- **Optimization:**
  - Significant improvements in endpoint speed, database query performance, and image size reduction

## Planned Azure Migration Strategy (2026)

### **Phase 1: Hybrid (Q1 2026)**

- Use Azure CDN for static assets
- Azure Blob Storage for images
- Trial Application Insights for monitoring
- Maintain compute workload on current VPS

### **Phase 2: Compute Migration (Q2 2026)**

- Move API to Azure App Service
- Transition database to Azure Database for MySQL
- Implement Azure Cache for Redis
- VPS handles background jobs

### **Phase 3: Full Azure (Q3 2026)**

- Azure Functions for batch processing
- Transition fully to managed services
- Retirement of legacy VPS infrastructure

## Specific Migration Challenges & Community Questions

- **Architecture Decisions:** App Service vs Functions, managed services selection, MySQL vs Azure SQL, understanding cost-benefit thresholds
- **Cost Management:** Strategies for startups to control Azure costs, reserved instances, pay-as-you-go evaluation
- **Migration Strategy:** Lift-and-shift vs re-architect, zero-downtime migration for large user base, safe validation and cutover patterns
- **Monitoring & DevOps:** Value of Application Insights, Azure DevOps vs GitHub Actions, managing operational burden during migration
- **Development Workflow:** Local dev against Azure services, affordable staging, testing without incurring high cloud costs
- **DevOps Practices:** Which DevOps processes and learnings on VPS transfer to Azure, what needs adjustment in cloud-native environments

---

## Key Takeaways

- Lean infrastructure can scale successfully with disciplined DevOps and optimization—even prior to cloud migration
- Budget limitations shape cloud adoption timing and phased plans
- Migration to Azure requires reassessment of cost, architecture, and workflow, especially for startups
- Hands-on experience with DevOps fundamentals provides a strong foundation but must adapt to cloud-native paradigms
