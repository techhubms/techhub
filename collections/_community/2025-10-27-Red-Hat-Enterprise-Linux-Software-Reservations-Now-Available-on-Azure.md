# Red Hat Enterprise Linux Software Reservations Now Available on Azure

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) software reservations are now available for purchase on Microsoft Azure, offering new ways for organizations to optimize Linux workload costs.

## What's New

- Azure now supports RHEL software reservations for customers.
- Updated billing meters and pricing now align with Red Hat's latest model.
- Improvements address earlier billing issues, ensuring accurate, transparent costs.

## Key Benefits

- **Cost Savings**: Save up to 24% compared to pay-as-you-go pricing by committing to a one-year term.
- **Predictable Costs**: Lock in pricing for RHEL workloads and optimize your cloud budget.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Enhanced billing meters for clarity.
- **Azure Integration**: Manage RHEL reservations alongside other Azure resources for seamless cloud operations.

Pre-purchasing RHEL software capacity through reservations means substantial savings compared to standard pay-as-you-go models, and lets organizations plan and budget more effectively.
