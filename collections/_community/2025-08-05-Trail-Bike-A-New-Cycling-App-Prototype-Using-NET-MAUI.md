Rywent introduces a prototype cycling app built with C# and MAUI, inviting feedback from the development community as he explores MAUI for cross-platform application design.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Trail Bike: A New Cycling App Prototype Using .NET MAUI

Author: Rywent

Rywent has started a new project that merges his interests in programming and cycling. The idea is to build a route planning and tracking application using C# and the .NET MAUI framework. Key features of the planned app include:

- Generating various cycling routes based on user preferences such as length and type.
- The ability to save and record cycling trips.
- Potentially sharing rides on a built-in social network within the app.

Currently, the work is in the UI layout stage, and Rywent notes that he is using this as an opportunity to learn and get hands-on with MAUI. Feedback is encouraged, especially from those with MAUI experience or ideas on cycling-related apps.

> _"I don't have much experience in MAUI yet, so while I'm making this app I'll be studying in parallel. Considering that I learn very quickly and understand well, I don't think this will be a problem."_

Community responses have praised the initiative, expressing interest in MAUI as a technology for fitness-related applications and supporting open examples that showcase MAUI's capabilities for cross-platform development.
