# Community Insights: Upskilling Strategies for C# Developers

**Author:** Ok_Finish_1661

### Introduction

Members reflect on the challenge of forgetting core concepts after years in development, and the recurring cycle of reviewing basics before upskilling to new technologies.

### Recommended Resources and Strategies

- **Books:**
  - _The C# Player's Guide_ is recommended for solidifying basic concepts. The sixth edition will be free for those who purchase the current fifth edition. [Book update](https://csharpplayersguide.com/blog/2025/03/14/another-6th-edition-update/).
  - _Framework Design Guide_ is cited as a strong foundation in .NET principles.
  - _Functional Programming in C#_ by Enrico Buonanno for modern C# paradigms.
- **Online Courses & Platforms:**
  - Community members use courses from Udemy and previously Pluralsight, though opinions vary on their effectiveness as platforms grew larger.
- **Hands-On Practice:**
  - Creating side projects is highlighted as a key learning method, from small practice applications to large games like recreating Star Wars Rebellion in vanilla C#.
  - Exploring technologies like RavenDB and event-driven architectures through side work.
- **Teaching Others:**
  - Some contributors suggest that preparing and recording explainer videos for platforms like YouTube (even with few views) solidifies one's own understanding.
  - "If you can understand something well enough to teach it, you understand it more than if you learned it for yourself."
- **Exploring Advanced Topics:**
  - Delving into advanced posts such as [how async/await really works](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/how-async-await-really-works/), despite the challenge of complex background concepts.
- **Source Code Exploration:**
  - Jumping on GitHub to study others' code for new approaches and tricks.

### General Advice

- Focus on project-based learning with real problems.
- Use books for deep understanding of principles.
- Leverage teaching and content creation as a way to reinforce knowledge.
- Revisit fundamental concepts when feeling stuck during upskilling.

### Community Spirit

- Members offer to support each other’s learning content, suggesting collaboration and mutual learning.

### Summary

This discussion assembles valuable approaches for developers seeking to upskill in the Microsoft .NET and C# ecosystem, blending traditional study methods with modern, practical, and community-driven strategies.
