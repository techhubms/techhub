# Microsoft’s Vision: AI-RAN and Intelligent Edge Transforming Telecom Networks

By Yongguang Zhang

## Overview

Artificial intelligence (AI) is converging with telecommunications to transform network operations and service delivery. Microsoft, at Mobile World Congress, lays out its strategy for AI in the radio access network (AI-RAN) and in intelligent edge computing, blending Azure’s cloud infrastructure and AI platforms with telecom innovation.

## AI-RAN: Merging AI with Radio Networks

**Three Paradigms of AI-RAN:**

- **AI for RAN:** Applying machine learning and AI to optimize spectrum use, manage energy and performance, and enable self-optimizing, self-healing mobile networks.
- **AI on RAN:** Deploying AI inference workloads at distributed cell sites and edge data centers to deliver ultra-low latency and support AI-powered applications (e.g., real-time translation, AR/VR).
- **AI and RAN:** Integrating AI resources and RAN functions in shared infrastructure for solutions like distributed sensing (5G cells as sensors) and physical AI (autonomous robots, smart factories).

**Key Outcomes:**

- Reduced operational/capital costs through dynamic, automated optimization
- Enhanced reliability via AI-driven anomaly detection and real-time spectrum analysis
- New service models with 5G/6G—AI-powered networks enabling additional revenue streams

## Edge AI: Cloud Intelligence at the Network Edge

**Intelligent Edge Computing:**

- Pushes processing and AI model inference closer to data sources (in cell sites, edge data centers)
- Serves applications demanding ultra-low latency, data privacy, and local processing (e.g., robotics, industrial IoT)
- Edge AI reduces backhaul traffic, ensures resilience when cloud connectivity is limited, and supports compliance with data sovereignty laws

**Real-World Impact:**

- Offloading robotics workloads to edge GPUs; case example of reducing inference latency from over a second to under 100ms
- Physical AI use cases: autonomous drones, hazard detection in smart cities, AR/VR experiences

## Microsoft’s AI Ecosystem for Telecom

**Core Platforms and Tools:**

- **Azure:** Hosts core mobile network functions (4G/5G), provides elasticity, extends to private data centers and edge through Azure Arc
- **Azure Machine Learning & Microsoft Foundry:** Platforms for operators to train, fine-tune, and serve advanced AI models, including those from OpenAI, Meta, and partners
- **Semantic Kernel, Copilot, and Network Operations Agent (NOA):** Open frameworks and agents enabling custom AI applications for network management, xApps, and telecom operations
- **Project Janus & Open RAN:** Supporting open, standards-based RAN programmability and AI-driven control for multivendor networks

**Ecosystem Collaboration:**

- Joint innovation with CSPs, manufacturers, and startups, including live testbed deployments covering 30+ sites globally
- Industry engagement (AI-RAN Alliance) to accelerate best practices and open interface adoption

## Architectural Vision & Future

- Unified management across cloud, edge, and RAN: Develop AI solutions in Azure and deploy seamlessly to distributed networks
- Carrier-grade reliability with cloud-scale AI, enabling zero-touch automation and advanced analytics
- Strategic investment in AI-driven telecom, fostering operator transformation into hyperscale tech organizations
