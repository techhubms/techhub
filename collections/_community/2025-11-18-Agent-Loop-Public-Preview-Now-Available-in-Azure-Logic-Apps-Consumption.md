# Agent Loop Public Preview Now Available in Azure Logic Apps Consumption

**Author:** Shree_Divya_M_V

## Overview

Agent Loop, previously limited to Logic Apps Standard, now debuts in Azure Logic Apps Consumption. This empowers developers, startups, SMBs, and enterprises to embed autonomous and conversational AI agents into their workflows—without provisioned AI infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **Hosted on Behalf Of (HOBO) Model**: Microsoft manages advanced Foundry language models, so users focus solely on workflow logic, not backend infrastructure.
- **Frictionless Setup**: Enables agentic workflows with just an Azure subscription—no complex provisioning needed.
- **Pay-As-You-Go Billing**: Charges based on agentic action token usage, ideal for prototyping and scaling.
- **Extensive Connector Ecosystem**: 1,400+ connectors for integrating with APIs, systems, and data sources.
- **Enterprise-Grade Path**: Seamlessly upgrade to Logic Apps Standard for enhanced compliance, VNET, and custom hosting when needed.
- **Security & Tenant Isolation**: Ensures workspace security boundaries.
- **OAuth-Based Authentication**: Built-in options for securing chat clients and workflows.

## Why It Matters

- **Accessibility**: Democratizes AI agent workflow creation for organizations of all sizes.
- **Serverless & Scalable**: Maintains the low-overhead, event-driven consumption model while providing access to advanced AI capabilities.
- **Rapid Iteration**: Supports experimental to production workloads. Upgrade seamlessly as requirements grow.
