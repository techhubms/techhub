misterebs and fellow educators discuss best practices for managing AI-enabled features like GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio while teaching foundational programming skills to students, offering strategies, alternative tools, and reflections on teaching philosophies.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Managing AI Features in Visual Studio for Education

**Author:** misterebs and community

## Overview

misterebs, a veteran high school Computer Science teacher, shares experiences using Visual Studio (VS) to teach programming languages like Visual BASIC and C/C++, and raises concerns about the presence of AI features such as GitHub Copilot and Intellisense in the educational environment.

Educators and community members contribute advice and opinions on restricting AI-driven tooling for beginners, with practical administration tips and broader commentary on programming pedagogy in the age of AI.

---

## Main Concerns

- **AI Integration in IDEs:** Teachers struggle with AI features (Copilot, Intellisense) interrupting foundational learning. Concerns center on students relying on AI before mastering core programming principles.
- **Difficulty Disabling AI:** The process to disable or exclude Copilot and similar features requires technical know-how, administrative rights, or institutional support.
- **Evolving IDE Preferences:** VS Code and cloud-based solutions like Codespaces are gaining traction, offering different experiences and configurability, sometimes preferred for their flexibility in academic settings.

---

## Key Strategies Suggested

- **Uninstalling/Blocking Copilot:** Teachers can open the Visual Studio installer to remove Copilot, though students might reinstall it. Organizational licensing may permit group policies to exclude Copilot via [group policy templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-github-copilot-admin?view=vs-2022).
- **Classroom Policy:** Teachers begin courses instructing students not to enable AI features. Some propose learning without Intellisense during early education stages.
- **Alternatives to VS:** Codespaces allows managed, AI-disabled environments for students, though with additional cost. VSCodium and older IDE versions provide further alternatives with minimal AI integration.

---

## Philosophical Perspectives

- **Foundational Skills Matter:** Several contributors argue that manual programming experience is critical before using AI tooling. They caution that over-reliance on Copilot or Intellisense can hamper basic skill acquisition.
- **AI as a Tool, Not a Crutch:** Some suggest explicitly teaching prompt engineering and “AI literacy” after students demonstrate competency, reflecting evolving industry practices.
- **Balancing Technology and Pedagogy:** Comments reflect the tension between leveraging modern IDE conveniences and preserving rigorous, hands-on educational standards.

## Community Reflections

- Nostalgia for earlier IDEs like Borland C++ 4.5 and Visual Basic 6 highlights how tooling and expectations have changed.
- Increasing popularity of VS Code (and Codespaces) in educational settings reflects both the technical shift and a desire for flexible configuration.
- The consensus is that while AI can be a powerful aid for advanced students, early learners benefit most from traditional, hands-on programming experiences without automated assistance.
