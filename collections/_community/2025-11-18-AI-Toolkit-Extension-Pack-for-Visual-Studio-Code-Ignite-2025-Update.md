# AI Toolkit Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code: Ignite 2025 Update

The Ignite 2025 update delivers a major leap forward for the AI Toolkit extension pack in VS Code. This release introduces a unified and efficient environment for building, visualizing, and deploying intelligent agentic applications. Developers can now:

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Build AI Agents Using GitHub Copilot

- Scaffold agent applications with best-practice patterns and tool-calling examples.
- Integrate tracing hooks and test scaffolds, powered by Copilot and aligned with the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview).
- Generate agent code using either Python or .NET, supporting multiple runtimes.

### 2. Design and Customize YAML Workflows

- Author YAML-based workflows in the Foundry portal, with editing and testing capabilities in VS Code.
- Instantly convert YAML workflows to Agent Framework code using GitHub Copilot for more customizable implementations.

### 3. Visualize Multi-Agent Workflows

- Inspect agent workflow structure with an interactive graph visualizer.
- Observe real-time updates as agents execute and debug complex graphs easily.

### 4. Experiment, Debug, and Evaluate Locally

- Use the Hosted Agents Playground to interact with agents on your development machine.
- Debug using local tracing support for reasoning steps, tool calls, and latency issues.
- Define metrics, tasks, and datasets for evaluation using the Foundry Evaluation SDK, and orchestrate evaluation runs with Copilot assistance.

### 5. Seamless Integration Across Environments

- Easily transition between the Foundry Portal and VS Code Web for a consistent development environment.
- Open and manage YAML workflows, playgrounds, and templates in VS Code.

## Getting Started

- **Install the AI Toolkit extension pack** from the VS Code marketplace.
- **Install the Azure MCP server extension** to use GitHub Copilot for interacting with Foundry resources.
- Use the AI Toolkit and Foundry extension icons within VS Code for access to all major features.
- **Install the** [Foundry SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/sdk-overview?pivots=programming-language-python) and review additional documentation.

## Feedback & Support

Submit any issues or feature requests to the [GitHub repo for Foundry extension](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-foundry-for-vscode/issues) and [AI Toolkit extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-ai-toolkit/issues). Community feedback is encouraged to enhance these tools further.
