# Oracle Database@Azure: Global Expansion and Technical Enhancements

**Author:** KalyanKaki

## Overview

Oracle Database@Azure has expanded to 31 regions worldwide, with two more regions planned soon—making it the most widely available solution among hyperscalers for running mission-critical Oracle workloads. This expansion means enterprises have more flexibility and locality for deployment.

## Key Security Enhancement: Azure Key Vault Integration

- **Azure Key Vault** (Standard, Premium, Managed HSM) is now generally available for Oracle Autonomous AI Database on Oracle Database@Azure.
- Enables secure storage and management of Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) keys.
- Integrates with Azure’s governance, monitoring, and lifecycle tools for centralized key management.
- Simplifies compliance, operations, and eliminates the need for external key management systems.
- Customers can select key management tiers matching their regulatory requirements.

## Regional Availability

- New regions: North Central, South India, and France South, among 31 total global regions.
- Expansion brings increased options for businesses with data residency or performance needs.
- Continued expansion—two additional regions planned within three months.

## Announcements and Technical Updates

- **Oracle Base Database Service GA on Azure:** Run any Oracle Database service (versions 19c or 26ai) on Azure.
- **Oracle Autonomous AI Lakehouse:** GA; unifies AI, analytics, and open data. Built on Apache Iceberg. Integrates with Microsoft Fabric and Power BI for advanced analytics and secure data application.
- **Smarter Connected Operations:** Oracle Smart Operations, Azure IoT Operations, and Microsoft Fabric RTI enable unified analytics and automation.
- **AI-Ready Data Unification:** Oracle Database mirroring in Fabric OneLake (preview); native OCI GoldenGate integration drives AI-optimized, real-time data estate.
- **AI Integration:** Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry now support direct Oracle data access for no-code/low-code AI apps.
- **Enterprise Security & Governance:** Integrations with Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, and Entra ID plus governance with Microsoft Purview.
- **Modernization & Automation:** Azure Arc, Azure Backup, Terraform support, Autonomous Database-S Elastic Pools, and DNS automation features streamline operations.

## Sessions and Community

- Sessions at Microsoft Ignite detail Oracle workload modernization on Azure, AI use cases, and partner opportunities.
