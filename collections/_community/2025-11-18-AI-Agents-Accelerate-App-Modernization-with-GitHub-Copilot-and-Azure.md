# AI Agents Accelerate App Modernization with GitHub Copilot and Azure

## The Modernization Moment: Why Now?

Legacy enterprise apps have long required slow, manual upgrades. Agentic AI—now integrated with GitHub Copilot and Azure—is changing that paradigm. IT leaders and developers can use automation to address high maintenance costs, technical debt, and skill gaps, enabling faster, more efficient modernization.

## Core Modernization Blockers Addressed

- **Resolving Technical Debt:** Many organizations spend most of their new project budget battling outdated systems and repetitive migrations.
- **Expertise Gaps:** Modernization projects are often hampered by uneven documentation and rare legacy skills.
- **Resource Drain:** Legacy app maintenance devours as much as 40% of developer time, limiting innovation.

## Ignite 2025: Key Announcements & Features

**1. Expanded Language and Framework Support**

- **Java:** J2EE to JakartaEE migration, IntelliJ integration, deployment to Azure, and Java 25 upgrades (GA).
- **.NET:** Migration/deployment to Azure, including Managed Instance on Azure App Service for legacy Windows apps—no major code rewrites. AI-assisted upgrade paths from .NET Framework to .NET (GA).
- **Python:** Transitioning from semantic kernel to agent framework (Public Preview).

**2. Automated Containerization**

- **Containerization Assist Integration:** GitHub Copilot now automates code updates, generates Dockerfiles, and creates artifacts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), AKS Automatic, and Azure Container Apps. This streamlines migration from monoliths to containerized deployments.

**3. Database Modernization**

- **PostgreSQL Extension:** Modernize PostgreSQL with VS Code integration; SQL Server migrations are streamlined via Azure Database Migration Service.
- **Oracle to PostgreSQL:** Copilot tracks schema changes and informs code updates for Java apps (Public Preview).

**4. Customization and Security Guardrails**

- GitHub Copilot now supports custom tasks for modernization, allowing organizations to enforce their own security standards, coding patterns, and frameworks. Tasks can be defined by diffs, markdown, or URLs and shared across teams (GA).

**5. Portfolio Assessment Integration**

- Unified, actionable visibility with Azure Migrate, Dr. Migrate, and CAST Highlight—integrated with GitHub Issues for comprehensive modernization planning (Public Preview).

**6. Autonomous Workflows**

- Coding Agent integration and Copilot CLI enable semi-autonomous modernization, allowing agents to analyze, plan, and execute upgrades from the command line.

## Practical Impact

- **Accelerate Time-to-Value:** Automation reduces manual effort, speeds up modernization, and frees developers for high-impact tasks.
- **Reduce Risk:** Standardized, AI-driven upgrade paths and compliance help avoid costly missteps.
- **Maximize ROI:** Fewer resources lost to manual maintenance; more budget for innovation.
- **Empower Collaboration:** Unified tooling breaks silos between IT and developers.
