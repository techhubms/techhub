# Linux on Azure at Microsoft Ignite 2025: What's New, Sessions, and Announcements

## Key Announcements

**1. Built-in CIS Benchmarks for Azure Linux (Public Preview)**  
CIS Benchmarks are now integrated into Azure Machine Configuration, enabling automated and customizable compliance across Azure, hybrid, and on-premises Linux estates. No additional tooling is needed, making large-scale governance simpler for organizations running critical workloads.

**2. Azure Linux OS Guard (Public Preview)**  
A new, hardened, immutable Linux container host for AKS, featuring enforced FIPS mode and a reduced attack surface. OS Guard brings default-secure, deep AKS integration for regulated and sensitive cloud-native workloads.

**3. Pod Sandboxing for AKS with Kata Containers (General Availability)**  
Fully managed Kata Containers are now GA for AKS, delivering VM-level isolation for pods—a key security feature for multi-tenant and compliance-minded deployment scenarios.
