AbhinavPremsekhar introduces new reporting features in Playwright Workspaces, enabling streamlined test report access, artifact control, and Azure-integrated debugging for development teams.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Reporting Features Now Available in Playwright Workspaces on Azure

**Author:** AbhinavPremsekhar

## Overview

The Playwright Workspaces platform—part of [Azure App Testing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-testing/)—now offers a fully integrated test reporting experience designed for teams running Playwright end-to-end tests at scale.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Reports in the Azure Portal:**
  All Playwright test result reports and artifacts are directly accessible via the Azure portal, eliminating the need to manually retrieve logs or files from CI systems.

- **Integrated Debugging:**
  The built-in Trace Viewer enables developers to visually inspect failed or flaky tests, showing step-by-step timelines, page state, DOM snapshots, logs, errors, and network activity for comprehensive troubleshooting.

- **Bring-Your-Own-Storage:**
  Teams can now link their own Azure Storage accounts (e.g., Azure Blob Storage), ensuring compliance with organizational policies. This gives full control over data retention, security, and reporting artifacts' storage locations.

- **Customizable Data Governance:**
  Define retention policies, security, and compliance rules for all test data.

- **Team Collaboration:**
  Shareable URLs for test reports facilitate team debugging and make collaboration around flaky or failed test cases straightforward. A unified reporting experience reduces miscommunication and improves efficiency.

## Getting Started

- Access the new reporting capabilities automatically as a Playwright Workspace user in the Azure portal.
- Storage integration can be configured to match your company’s governance model.
- [Quickstart Guide](https://aka.ms/pww-reporting) and [Troubleshooting FAQs](https://aka.ms/pww-reporting-tsg) are provided for setup assistance.

## Feedback

Feedback is encouraged via the [official feedback channel](https://aka.ms/pww-feedback) to help shape future improvements.
