Julia Muiruri from Microsoft introduces the JavaScript AI Build-a-thon, a hands-on program for developers to gain practical experience building AI-powered apps using JavaScript, TypeScript, and Microsoft Foundry tools with expert support.<!--excerpt_end-->

# The JavaScript AI Build-a-thon: Season 2

**Author:** Julia Muiruri

Most applications used by millions daily rely on JavaScript and TypeScript. However, most AI tutorials and tools target Python, leaving JS/TS developers with a fragmented learning path. The JavaScript AI Build-a-thon is designed to bridge this gap, offering a four-week, free, practical learning program focused on building real AI applications in JavaScript/TypeScript with Microsoft technologies.
