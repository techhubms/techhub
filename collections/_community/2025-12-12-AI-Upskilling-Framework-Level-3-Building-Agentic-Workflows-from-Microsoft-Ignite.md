# AI Upskilling Framework Level 3: Building Agentic Workflows from Microsoft Ignite

The Global AI Community brings an in-depth session from Microsoft Ignite on the "AI Upskilling Framework Level 3 Building," designed to help developers accelerate their understanding and adoption of agentic workflows using Microsoft technologies.

## AI Upskilling Framework Overview

- **Purpose:** Address the growing need for AI skills across all roles, from sales to engineers.
- **Five-Level Framework:** Developed by LinkedIn Learning leveraging insights from its global community and expert instructors; validated by LinkedIn’s AI engineering experts.
- **Goal:** Provide a structured model for organizational AI upskilling, adaptable to a variety of use cases and experience levels.

## Level 3: Building – Key Session Highlights

- **Blueprint of Agentic Workflows:** Explanation of agentic workflow concepts, how agent-based systems differ from traditional, and value to organizations.
- **Understanding Agents:** What defines an agent, why this architecture matters, and adoption challenges.
- **Practical Use Cases & Tools:** Real-world agentic solutions were demonstrated, notably:
  - **Live demo with Microsoft Foundry**: Showcasing design and implementation
  - **Microsoft Agentic Framework (MAF):** Introduction and comparison with older workflows
- **Demos:**
  - **Claims Intake Workflow**: Demonstrating process transformation
  - **Claims Fraud Detection Workflow:** Emphasizing how agentic architecture enhances fraud detection
- **Takeaways:** How to translate these concepts and demos into your own projects using Microsoft resources.
