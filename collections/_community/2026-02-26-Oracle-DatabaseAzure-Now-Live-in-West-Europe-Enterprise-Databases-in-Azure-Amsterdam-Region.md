# Oracle Database@Azure Now Live in West Europe (Amsterdam)

**Author:** SparshAgrawat

Organizations across Europe are accelerating cloud modernization and AI initiatives, with data locality, compliance, and performance at the forefront. Microsoft and Oracle's partnership has rapidly expanded Oracle Database@Azure, enabling enterprise-grade Oracle database services natively within Azure datacenters worldwide.

## What’s New

- **Oracle Database@Azure is now generally available in West Europe (Amsterdam)**.
- Brings Oracle database services physically into the Amsterdam Azure region.

## Why Amsterdam Matters

- **Meets EU data residency/sovereignty requirements**: Oracle data stays within the Netherlands, simplifying compliance.
- **Reduces latency**: Oracle databases and Azure services are co-located, benefiting performance.
- **Enables regulated industries**: Suits financial, public sector, utilities, retail, and healthcare with strict locality policies.
- **Resiliency options**: Supports regional/in-country disaster recovery architectures for business continuity.

## Unified Data Platform Without Re-architecting

- **Oracle-managed services** run directly on Exadata infrastructure inside Azure datacenters.
- **Azure internal networking**: Offers predictable performance, near-zero latency, and avoids cross-cloud complexity.
- **Available database services**:
  - Oracle Exadata Database Service (Dedicated, Exascale)
  - Oracle Autonomous Database
  - Oracle Base Database Service
  - Oracle GoldenGate, Autonomous Recovery Services
- **Native Azure integration**: Identity, networking, security, management—all Azure-native.

## Benefits for European Enterprises

- **Migrate to Azure without code changes**: Move existing Oracle databases with minimal risk or disruption.
- **Familiar tools, greater modernization**: Leverage Oracle skills while using Azure AI, analytics, or app platforms.
- **Licensing flexibility**: BYOL (Bring Your Own License) or license-included options.
- **Ideal for complex/custom workloads**: Suited to applications in Azure accessing custom Oracle databases.

## How to Get Started

- Now available in **33 Azure regions** globally, including Amsterdam.
- Deploy Oracle Database@Azure directly from Azure portal.
