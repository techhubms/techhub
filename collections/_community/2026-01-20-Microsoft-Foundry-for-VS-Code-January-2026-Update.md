# Microsoft Foundry for VS Code: January 2026 Update

The January 2026 update to the Microsoft Foundry extension for Visual Studio Code delivers a suite of features aimed at making AI workflow development more streamlined and developer-friendly for Azure AI Foundry users.

## Key Enhancements

### Support for Multiple Workflows in the Visualizer

- Developers can now view, design, debug, and optimize multiple interconnected workflows within a single project using the enhanced Workflow Visualizer.
- This allows for easier context-switching and handling of complex AI solutions.

### Interactive Prompt Agent Testing in the Playground

- All prompt agents are now visible and testable within the Playground interface.
- Iteratively validate agent logic and refine prompts before deploying, helping ensure desired outcomes.

### Open Code Files for Agents

- Access sample code files for various agent types:
  - Prompt agents
  - YAML-based workflows
  - Hosted agents
  - Foundry Classic agents
- Enables programmatic execution of agents and seamless integration into existing projects.

### Separated Resource View for v1 and v2 Agents

- Enhanced clarity with a distinct view separating Foundry Classic (v1) resources and new-generation (v2) agents.
- Simplifies resource management, keeping legacy and new elements distinguishable.

## Getting Started

- Install or update the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vscode-ai-foundry).
- Begin creating, testing, and managing AI agents and workflows using the improved tooling.
- Consult official [Microsoft Learn documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/get-started-projects-vs-code?view=foundry) for further guidance.

## Feedback & Support

- Feedback is welcomed through the [GitHub repo for the Foundry extension](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-foundry-for-vscode/issues).
- Continuous improvement is driven by user contributions and suggestions.

These updates reinforce Microsoft Foundry’s commitment to a developer-first experience, supporting advanced orchestration and management of multi-agent AI systems within Azure.
