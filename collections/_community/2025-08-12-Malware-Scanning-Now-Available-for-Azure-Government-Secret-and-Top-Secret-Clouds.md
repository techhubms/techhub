# Malware Scanning Now Available for Azure Government Secret and Top-Secret Clouds

Microsoft Defender for Storage now offers malware scanning capabilities for storage accounts in Azure Government Secret and Top-Secret Clouds, aligning feature sets across both commercial and government environments. This enhancement is designed to help organizations in the public sector protect sensitive data and meet strict regulatory standards.

## Why Government Cloud Malware Scanning Matters

Organizations in government environments manage classified and regulated data. Enabling malware scanning addresses:

- Protection of classified and sensitive documents from malware and infected uploads
- Prevention against lateral movement or staging attacks across departments or third-party vendors
- Adherence to industry compliance requirements such as FedRAMP, CJIS, and FISMA
- Continuous threat monitoring and immediate response leveraging up-to-date threat intelligence
- Implementation of Zero Trust security principles

## Malware Scanning Triggers

Defender for Storage's agentless solution offers two key scanning options:

- **On-upload scanning:** Automatically scans blobs as they're uploaded or modified for real-time threat detection.
- **On-demand scanning:** Allows for manual or scheduled scanning in response to emerging security concerns or compliance audits.

> *Note: Enabling on-upload scanning is required for on-demand scanning to function.*

## Enabling Malware Scanning

Customers can enable malware scanning in Defender for Storage using various tools and interfaces:

- **Azure Built-In Policy** (recommended)
- Azure Portal UI
- Infrastructure as Code
- REST API
- PowerShell

## Advanced Configuration Options

Advanced features empower high-security organizations to tailor scanning and monitoring, including:

- Detailed logging of scan results for audit and forensics
- Integration with Azure Event Grid custom topics for automated responses
- Connectivity with Azure Log Analytics for centralized analysis
- Ability to override at the subscription or resource level
- Customizable scanning limits (e.g., monthly GB)
