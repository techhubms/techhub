vladvino details the integration of AI Gateway into Microsoft Foundry, highlighting new unified governance and security features for enterprise-scale AI workloads with Azure API Management.<!--excerpt_end-->

# AI Gateway in Azure API Management Now Integrated with Microsoft Foundry

For more than a decade, Azure API Management has been the backbone for API governance, security, and observability, handling billions of requests for thousands of organizations. The new AI Gateway builds on this legacy by extending governance, security, and operational controls to AI workloads—including models, tools, and agents.

## Key Integration Highlights

- **Unified Control:** AI Gateway is now integrated directly into Microsoft Foundry, giving users consistency, reliability, and enterprise-grade security for AI models, agents, and tools.
- **Governance at Scale:** Enterprises can apply token quotas, usage limits, and rich governance policies centrally without leaving Foundry. Both existing and new API Management resources are supported.
- **Consistent Security & Observability:** All model deployments are routed through the AI Gateway for secure, observable access. Telemetry goes directly to Foundry or Application Insights for monitoring.
- **Agent & Tool Governance:** Organizations can register agents running anywhere (Azure, other clouds, on-prem) for unified inventory and policy enforcement. Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools across environments receive automatic governance and are ready for secure agentic interaction.
- **Enterprise Features:** Advanced governance (throttling, content safety), fine-grained network controls, federated gateways—all available without losing continuity in configuration.
- **Easy Setup:** Deploy AI Gateway from the Foundry interface, with API Management Basic v2 instance free for the first 100,000 calls. See [setup instructions](https://aka.ms/apim/docs/enable-foundry-ai-gateway).

## Developer Benefits

- **Streamlined Experience:** Developers can build, deploy, and secure AI solutions with minimal friction and without switching tools or platforms.
- **Cost-Efficiency & Compliance:** Central controls help organizations remain compliant and manage usage costs.
- **Observability:** Real-time monitoring and detailed telemetry for every AI agent and workload.

## Getting Started

To deploy or associate AI Gateway within Foundry:

1. Access Foundry and navigate to the AI Gateway setup article: [Enable AI Gateway in Foundry](https://aka.ms/apim/docs/enable-foundry-ai-gateway).
2. Configure governance policies directly in the Foundry interface.
3. Register models, agents, and tools for centralized management and monitoring.
