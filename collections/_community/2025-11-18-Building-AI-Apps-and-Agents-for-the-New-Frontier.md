Mike Hulme discusses the impact of Microsoft’s agentic AI and developer tools, including GitHub Copilot, Foundry, and Azure services, on building and managing next-generation applications securely and efficiently.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Building AI Apps and Agents for the New Frontier

Mike Hulme explores the new wave of agentic applications, spotlighting innovations announced at Microsoft Ignite around AI-driven platforms, agent orchestration, and developer productivity. This overview centers on how organizations can harness Microsoft Azure, GitHub Copilot, and related developer services to modernize, secure, and accelerate their software lifecycles using AI and agentic architectures.

## Key Highlights

- **Agentic Applications and Frontier Organizations:**
  - Frontier organizations leverage agentic AI apps to drive creativity, problem solving, rapid prototyping, and market refinement.
  - AI agents are integrated into developer workflows, streamlining processes and operating alongside teams as active members.

- **Agentic DevOps:**
  - Microsoft’s strategy redefines DevOps for an AI-native world, integrating intelligence at every stage of the software lifecycle.
  - Developers orchestrate agent fleets for code review, testing, defect resolution, and modernization of legacy apps (.NET, Java).
  - GitHub Agent HQ will soon support coding agents like Codex, Claude Code, Jules, plus custom agents and bring-your-own-models.
  - GitHub Copilot is highlighted as the world’s top AI pair programmer, saving thousands of developer days and accelerating modernization by up to 88%.
  - Azure SRE Agent and DevOps integrations automate incident management and diagnostics, with examples showing 7K+ incidents handled and 10,000+ hours saved.

- **Full-Stack AI App and Agent Platform:**
  - Microsoft Foundry helps organizations transition from experimentation to enterprise execution at scale, supporting open frameworks and standard protocols (MCP).
  - Foundry adds more than 11,000 models (OpenAI's GPT-5, Claude, Phi) and dynamic model routing.
  - Foundry IQ reimagines RAG workflows, powered by Azure AI Search.
  - Foundry Agent Service, Tools, and Control Plane centralize agent hosting, business integration, and security/governance in public preview.

- **AI Ready Foundation on Azure:**
  - Managed Instance for Azure App Service enables seamless migration of .NET web apps to cloud PaaS, reducing overhead and enabling scalability and access to AI capabilities.
  - MCP Governance via Azure API Management unifies enterprise API and agent governance.
  - Azure Logic Apps and Agent Loop introduce adaptive automation using low-code tools and native AI integrations.
  - Azure Functions, Container Apps, and security enhancements optimize agent deployment, orchestration, and operational confidentiality.

- **Security and Reliability:**
  - Microsoft Defender for Cloud and GitHub Advanced Security integrate runtime context with code to enable AI-powered threat remediation and prioritize alerts.
  - Automatic linking from runtime threat tracing to GitHub code delivers real-time suggested fixes and collaborative tracking for developers and security teams.
  - Azure SRE Agent powers self-healing cloud reliability, no-code automation, event-driven orchestration—enabling innovative operational practices and cost savings.

## Actionable Resources and Learning

- Recommended Microsoft Ignite sessions for developers and architects:
  - BRK103: Modernize your apps in days, not months, with GitHub Copilot
  - BRK110: Build AI Apps fast with GitHub and Microsoft Foundry in action
  - BRK114: AI Agent architectures, pitfalls, and real-world business impact
  - BRK115: Inside Microsoft’s AI transformation across the software lifecycle
- Announcements and further insight available via [Agent Factory](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/aka.ms/AgentFactory), [App Modernization Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/aka.ms/AppModernizationBlog), and [Secure Code to Cloud Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/aka.ms/SecureCodetoCloudBlog).

## Conclusion

Microsoft is advancing the agentic app ecosystem for developers and enterprises—integrating AI, security, governance, and cloud-native capabilities for high-impact transformation. Developers can reference Ignite on-demand sessions and linked resources for hands-on learning and to explore next-gen AI architectures.
