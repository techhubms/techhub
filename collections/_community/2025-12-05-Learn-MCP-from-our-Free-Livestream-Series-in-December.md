# Learn MCP from our Free Livestream Series in December

Join Pamela Fox for a practical, three-part series on MCP (Model Context Protocol)—a new open standard for extending AI agents and chat interfaces with real-world data, tools, and execution environments.

## What is MCP?

MCP is designed as an interoperability layer for LLMs and AI agents, making it possible to connect services like GitHub Copilot or custom internal developer bots to your own APIs or systems. Whether you're prototyping with local servers or deploying enterprise-grade solutions, MCP helps bridge AI with actionable real-world operations.

## Series Overview

The series will guide participants through:

- **Local prototyping of MCP servers** using Python and the FastMCP SDK
- **Cloud deployments**, including containerizing MCP with Docker and deploying to Azure Container Apps and Azure Functions
- **Enterprise authentication and security** using OAuth2 and Microsoft Entra

Each session demonstrates incremental steps, allowing developers and AI builders to start basic and end with production-ready, secure deployments.

### Supplementary Resources

- [Register for the full series](https://aka.ms/PythonMCP/series/w)
- [Office hours on Foundry Discord](http://aka.ms/aipython/oh)
- [Free MCP-for-beginners course on GitHub](https://aka.ms/PythonMCP/repo)

## Session Details
