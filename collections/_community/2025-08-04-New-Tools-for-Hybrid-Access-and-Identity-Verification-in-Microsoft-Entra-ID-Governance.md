In this article, Joseph Dadzie introduces new Microsoft Entra ID governance tools for hybrid environments, detailing features like Group SOA conversion and Face Check for secure, auditable access management.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Introduction

Identity governance is becoming increasingly vital as organizations operate across cloud, remote, and on-premises environments. To address the challenges in access management and compliance, Microsoft is adding two major capabilities to Microsoft Entra ID Governance: Group Source of Authority (SOA) conversion and Face Check in Entitlement Management.

## New Capabilities Announced

### Group Source of Authority (SOA) Conversion

This feature streamlines the governance of legacy Active Directory (AD) security groups by converting them into dynamic and policy-driven groups managed in Microsoft Entra ID. Key benefits include:

- **Cloud Management:** AD groups are managed in Entra ID, centralizing control and increasing flexibility and visibility.
- **On-Premises Cleanup:** Unused or redundant groups can be removed from AD after migration, improving manageability.
- **Governance for On-Premises Apps:** Modern governance policies, request workflows, expiration, and AI-assisted reviews can be applied to groups used by on-premises apps without breaking compatibility.
- **Group Writeback:** Ensures that changes made in the cloud propagate correctly to on-premises systems.

This capability helps organizations quickly modernize access control for legacy infrastructure while maintaining compatibility.

### Face Check in Entitlement Management

Integrating Microsoft Entra Verified ID and Face Check directly into Entitlement Management adds a new, high-assurance layer of identity verification. Features include:

- **Automated Identity Verification:** Matches a user’s selfie to a government-issued credential before granting access to sensitive resources.
- **Accelerated Onboarding:** Reduces delays and manual identity checks, particularly for contractors and guests.
- **Stronger Access Assurance:** Ensures only authorized individuals obtain access, improving compliance and auditability.

## Real-World Scenario: Contoso Finance

A practical example is provided with Contoso Finance, where the Finance department uses a business-critical on-premises application controlled by a traditional AD group. Moving governance to the cloud involves:

1. **Transitioning the AD Group:** The group becomes manageable from the cloud using Group SOA conversion, with changes synced back to AD via Cloud Sync.
2. **Lifecycle Governance:** The group is wrapped with an access package that enforces request-based access, approval workflows, and expiry policies.
3. **High-Assurance Verification:** For enhanced security, users must complete a privacy-respecting Face Check (selfie matched to government-issued ID) before gaining access.

This approach modernizes access management for a legacy app without requiring updates to the application itself.

## Key Takeaways

- Organizations can now bring structure, automation, and intelligence to identity and access management for hybrid and legacy environments.
- Modern cloud-native policy enforcement, approval workflows, time-bound controls, and real-time verification are available for both cloud and on-premises apps.
- No major changes are needed to legacy applications to benefit from these new governance capabilities.

## Getting Started
