# Microsoft 365 Local Launches for Sovereign Cloud Deployments

Microsoft 365 Local is now generally available, delivering a new deployment framework that allows organizations and governments to run core collaboration tools—Exchange Server, SharePoint Server, Skype for Business Server—on Azure Local for robust data sovereignty and compliance.

## Key Features and Architecture

- Based on [Microsoft Sovereign Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/industry/sovereignty/cloud) and [Azure Local Premier Solutions](https://azurelocalsolutions.azure.microsoft.com/)
- Validated reference architecture supporting mission-critical sovereign and regulatory requirements
- Supports deployment sizing, configuration, and best practices via partner-led services

## Infrastructure Management

- Azure acts as the central control plane for managing wide-ranging workloads
- Full-stack deployment visibility in Azure portal, spanning servers and clusters
- All hosts and VMs are Arc-enabled by default for built-in monitoring (connectivity, health, security updates)

## Security and Compliance Controls

- Network Security Groups managed with SDN (software defined networking) via Azure Arc
- Security baseline of over 300 settings enforced across host/VMs, covering:
  - Network security
  - Identity and access management
  - Privileged access
  - Data protection
- Built-in compliance features help organizations meet local regulations and reduce risk

## Integration with Azure Services

- Unified management with Azure Monitor and Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Security alerts, health checks, and recommendations integrated for proactive governance

## Disconnected Operations Coming

- Azure Local disconnected operation support planned for early 2026—enabling fully offline sovereign deployments for sensitive workloads
