# The Rise of Agentic BSS in the IQ Era: From Systems of Record to Systems of Outcome

**Authors:** [Rode Kirk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodek/) and [Rick Lievano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricklievano/)

Telecom Business Support Systems (BSS) are experiencing a pivotal transformation as agentic AI reshapes how communications service providers (CSPs) operate. Traditional BSS stacks, designed for linear processes and human-driven workflows, are reaching their limits in an era demanding programmable networks, composable products, and personalized real-time experiences. Agentic BSS instead enables intelligent agents to continuously sense, decide, and act, evolving the paradigm from systems of record to systems of outcome.

## The BSS Layer in Telecom

The BSS layer forms the commercial core of a CSP, governing service design, sales, pricing, order management, billing, and partner settlements. Capabilities include:

- Product and offer catalog management
- Customer/account management
- Order orchestration
- Billing and revenue management
- Partner settlement

Modern BSS enables CSPs to rapidly launch new services, monetize 5G/IoT, and support complex B2B2X ecosystems.

## Complexity in Telecom BSS

BSS complexity stems from:

1. Tight coupling across commercial processes
2. High-volume, real-time transactions
3. Stringent regulatory and financial demands
4. Multi-vendor environments
5. Evolving technology and business models

Legacy BSS struggles with continuous optimization or autonomous actions, so CSPs face high operational costs and slow innovation.

## Agentic BSS: Real-World AI Use Cases

Agentic BSS introduces goal-driven AI agents operating across domains:

1. **Autonomous Quote-to-Order Orchestration:** Agents interpret intent, validate eligibility, configure products, resolve exceptions, and orchestrate cross-domain orders (e.g., the T-Mobile US Retail example).
2. **Intelligent Revenue Assurance & Leakage Prevention:** Agents monitor usage and billing, detect anomalies, and correct revenue issues.
3. **Adaptive Product & Pricing Optimization:** Agents analyze customer data/signals to dynamically recommend offerings.
4. **Proactive Customer Lifecycle Management:** Agents predict churn, trigger retention, personalize interventions.
5. **Partner & Ecosystem Automation:** Agents handle onboarding, compliance, settlement, and dispute resolution at scale.

> AI-powered agents act as copilots for telecom employees, surfacing recommendations and helping frontline workers improve customer experiences.

## Microsoft Copilot Studio in Agentic BSS

**Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS)** provides the orchestration backbone for creating, governing, and scaling agentic business processes. Key features include:

- Designing goal-driven agents across BSS workflows
- Secure connection to enterprise systems using connectors/APIs
- Governance with enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Deployment across Microsoft Teams and digital channels

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** further enables dynamic integration, allowing agents to leverage external tools/knowledge servers in real time, reducing manual integrations and accelerating innovation.

## TM Forum, Open APIs, and Interoperability

Microsoft actively supports the TM Forum Open Digital Architecture (ODA) ecosystem, leveraging TM Forum Open APIs for standard, interoperable BSS integrations. Copilot technologies accelerate API development, reduce boilerplate, and allow:

- Agents to invoke APIs securely
- Dynamic discovery and execution of BSS actions
- Decoupling from vendor-specific implementations

**MCP** is increasingly essential for reliable, AI-driven BSS automation, as highlighted by the TM Forum and industry case studies.

## Integrating BSS Platforms & Accelerating Innovation

Copilot Studio and MCP connect seamlessly with third-party BSS platforms via open APIs, supporting:

- Real-time access to BSS data/tools
- Automatic synchronization with evolving APIs
- Secure and governed low-maintenance integrations

This approach allows CSPs to innovate above the BSS layer, driving rapid experimentation and automation without destabilizing core systems.

## Case Study: Copilot Studio in Action

Partnering with [Exos Systems](https://www.exos-systems.com/), Microsoft has demonstrated agentic BSS platforms leveraging Open APIs, Copilot Studio, and MCP for role-specific agents:

- **Product Expert:** Conversational access to product information/upgrades
- **Billing Expert:** Explains billing anomalies by correlating bills and usage
- **Order Expert:** Handles order inquiries and autonomously remediates failures

These solutions showcase how agentic AI can streamline BSS operations, reduce friction, and shorten time-to-value. For hands-on demonstrations, visit Microsoft's booth at Mobile World Congress.

## Build Your Own Agent: Hands-on at Mobile World Congress 2026

Attendees can participate in a workshop to build a fully functional Billing Analysis AI Agent with Copilot Studio, using no-code/low-code orchestration in under 45 minutes. The agent can detect billing anomalies, flag churn risks, generate reports, and publish enterprise-wide.

Participants will:

- Connect data, workflows, and logic
- Fine-tune and deploy their own agent
- Gain architectural patterns for AI use cases

Hardware is provided, and registration is available [here](https://microsoft.eplannerpro.com/MWC2026/BuildanAgent) or on-site.

## Strategic Takeaway

Agentic BSS, enabled by Copilot Studio, TM Forum Open APIs, and MCP, empowers telecom organizations to upgrade traditional platforms into intelligent, outcome-driven systems—driving new levels of speed, agility, and differentiation in the AI-native telecom era.
