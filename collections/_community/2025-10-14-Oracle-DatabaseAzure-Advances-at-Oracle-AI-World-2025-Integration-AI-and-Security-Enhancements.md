# Oracle Database@Azure Advances at Oracle AI World 2025: Integration, AI, and Security Enhancements

## Overview

At Oracle AI World 2025, Microsoft and Oracle unveiled major advancements expanding Oracle Database@Azure’s capabilities. This collaboration merges Oracle's database technology with Microsoft’s Azure, AI, cloud, and security platforms. The updates are aimed at providing unified data management, enterprise-grade security, AI-powered integrations, and operational automation for mission-critical workloads.

## Key Developments

- **Global Expansion:** Oracle Database@Azure is now available in new regions, adding South India, Central India, and Canada East, to help customers meet local compliance, reduce latency, and improve resilience.

- **Expanded Database Offerings:** Oracle Base Database Service (including 19c and 23ai) is generally available. Customers can choose from a full portfolio (Exadata, Exascale, Autonomous Database) natively on Azure.

- **Autonomous AI Lakehouse:** Built on Apache Iceberg and Oracle AI Database 26ai, this service is now generally available, providing seamless analytics and AI integration with Microsoft Fabric and Power BI.

- **Smart Operations and IoT:** The general availability of Oracle Smart Operations, Azure IoT Operations, and Microsoft Fabric RTI unifies real-time analytics and automation across operations.

- **AI-Ready Data Unification:** Oracle Database mirroring in OneLake for Microsoft Fabric (public preview) and native GoldenGate integration create real-time, AI-optimized data environments without heavy ETL overhead. These enable cross-environment analytics and operational AI.

- **AI Integration:** Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry now support direct Oracle data access for no-code/low-code AI app development. This integration enables developers and analysts to automate workflows and build intelligent agents that leverage Oracle and Azure data.

- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Deep integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Sentinel (SIEM/SOAR), Entra ID (identity governance), and Microsoft Purview ensures data protection and compliance for Oracle workloads.

- **Operational Modernization:** Azure Arc centralizes management and policy enforcement across multicloud/hybrid environments, while new features (Azure Backup, Elastic Pools, Terraform/SDK, enhanced provisioning) improve automation and reliability.

- **Programs and Community:** Azure Accelerate for Oracle supports cloud and AI journeys with expert advice, funding, and best practices. The Microsoft MVP program now covers Oracle Database@Azure, enhancing community and partner engagement.

## AI and Data Integration Highlights

- **AI-Driven Workflows:** Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry make it possible to design, deploy, and manage AI agents and analytics directly over live Oracle data.
- **Unified Data Pipelines:** Features like Oracle Database Mirroring in OneLake, GoldenGate replication, and Autonomous AI Lakehouse help organizations create real-time, AI-ready data estates with minimal integration complexity.

## Security and Automation

- **Integrated Security:** Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, and Entra ID provide end-to-end protection, zero-trust access, and compliance for Oracle assets on Azure.
- **Streamlined Operations:** Azure Arc, Terraform, Azure Backup, and automation enhancements simplify deployment, backup, disaster recovery, and management for complex, hybrid Oracle environments.

## Customer Impact and Programs

- **Customer Success:** Enterprise customers (e.g., Activision Blizzard) are leveraging Oracle Database@Azure for real-time analytics, governed AI-powered workflows, and simplified multicloud operations.
- **Partner and MVP Ecosystem:** The platform’s expansion in the Microsoft MVP and partner programs encourages wider adoption, support, and innovation.
