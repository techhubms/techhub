# Build the Future of AI-Driven Apps with SharePoint Embedded

Are you ready to develop blazing-fast, AI-powered, document-centric applications—without reinventing storage, access control, or compliance? SharePoint Embedded is designed as a headless, API-driven platform for modern developers to create next-generation content apps using the same secure services that power Microsoft 365.

## What Is SharePoint Embedded?

SharePoint Embedded delivers:

- **Headless, API-only architecture:** Developers can build custom apps while managing their own user experience, yet inherit Microsoft's compliance and security frameworks.
- **Integration with AI:** Easily bring capabilities like Copilot and Office collaboration into your own apps.
- **No need to rebuild core services:** Utilize built-in storage, access control, identity, and compliance.

## Video Walkthrough

- **Microsoft Mechanics Demo:** [Watch the deep-dive video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZyKl8JySmY) to see SharePoint Embedded in action. It demonstrates building secure, AI-powered, content-rich apps, and covers best practices for leveraging the platform’s strengths.

## Developer Events

### TechCon ATL (August 14)

- **Session:** *Build Custom Copilot Solutions with SharePoint Embedded*
