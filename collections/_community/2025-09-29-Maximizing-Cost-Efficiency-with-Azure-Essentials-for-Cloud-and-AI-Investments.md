- Invest in skills development and certifications for informed, efficient resource management

#### 2. Design and Govern

- Incorporate cost considerations during all stages of solution design (compute, storage, networking)
- Implement governance policies for spending accountability and compliance
- Use proven Microsoft solutions, reference architectures, and accelerators for faster, cost-effective delivery
- Design scalable systems that maintain efficiency at scale

#### 3. Manage and Optimize

- Continuously monitor spending and resource utilization with Microsoft tools
- Quantify business value and ROI for ongoing investments
- Remediate inefficiencies via rightsizing, automation, and workload optimization
- Maximize value with pricing offers and intelligent optimization recommendations
