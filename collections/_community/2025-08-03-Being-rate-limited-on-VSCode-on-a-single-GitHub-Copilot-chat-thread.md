In this community post, matt_o_matic shares their experience of unexpectedly being rate limited by GitHub Copilot in VSCode while using a single chat thread for complex project scaffolding.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Being Rate Limited on VSCode on a Single Chat Thread

**Author:** matt_o_matic

### Overview

The author describes an experience of being rate limited by GitHub Copilot while working in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The rate limiting occurred even though they were operating within a single chat thread and focusing on the initial scaffolding of a sophisticated application. They note that the operations performed were relatively large, but they did not expect to hit API rate limits under these circumstances.

### Details

- **Context:** Author is a Copilot Pro+ user since the feature's release.
- **Workflow:** Used Copilot's chat in a single VSCode window, not switching between multiple projects.
- **Intended Usage:** Involved asking Copilot to generate or scaffold the core of a comprehensive application, likely requiring several large requests.
- **Issue Encountered:** Hit an API rate limit despite minimal overall usage for the current billing cycle (2.5% of the premium quota used, and only the third day of the month).
- **Expectation:** The author expected protections against excessive premium requests, but not API-level rate limiting in such a scenario—especially given usage patterns and subscription tier.

### Observations

- First instance of this issue after extensive history with Copilot Pro+.
- No evidence of attempted abuse or using Copilot across multiple projects simultaneously.

### Unanswered Questions

- Is this typical? Are the limits for single-threaded chat lower than expected?
- Could there be transient backend changes or updates affecting rate limit policies?
- Is it possible to avoid such rate limiting under normal, single-project workflows?
