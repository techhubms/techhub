Author cynthiazanoni invites developers to participate in the MCP Bootcamp, an international series teaching Model Context Protocol, LLM integration, Copilot, Azure deployment, and real-time features.<!--excerpt_end-->

### Overview

The MCP Bootcamp, presented by cynthiazanoni, is a multilingual, multi-region workshop series focusing on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). These sessions are designed for developers, AI engineers, and cloud architects interested in building, integrating, and scaling AI-powered solutions using MCP.

### Session Structure and Topics

Each track (available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese) delivers four progressive sessions:

#### 1. **Fundamentals: Creating Your First MCP Server**

- Learn the foundational concepts of MCP.
- Develop and test your own MCP server using official protocol tools.
- Hands-on experience suitable for newcomers.

#### 2. **MCP Integration with LLMs, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot**

- Connect MCP with large language models to interpret natural commands.
- Integrate this workflow using VS Code and GitHub Copilot.
- Explore practical AI-powered development environments and automation aids.

#### 3. **Real-Time Communication: SSE & HTTP Streaming**

- Enhance your MCP server by incorporating Server-Sent Events (SSE) and streamable HTTP.
- Achieve real-time communication for applications that require instant updates.

#### 4. **Deployment on Azure**

- Learn to containerize and professionally deploy your MCP application using Azure Container Apps.
- Cover best practices in cloud deployment, continuous integration, and scaling MCP solutions.
