Nguyenkien shares news about the WinUI project's phased transition toward open source collaboration, outlining Microsoft’s efforts to involve the community.<!--excerpt_end-->

### Summary

The article announces that the Microsoft WinUI (Windows UI Library) project is adopting a phased rollout approach to increase its openness and community collaboration. This change is intended to transition the project further into the open-source arena, allowing more direct community involvement and contributions.

### Key Points

- **Phased Rollout:** The project’s move toward open collaboration will happen in stages. This gradual process allows Microsoft and the project maintainers to integrate feedback, adapt processes, and ensure quality as new contributors participate.
- **Community Engagement:** The intention is to create more transparent communication with community members, enabling open discussions and sharing more of the project's planning and development work.
- **Open Collaboration Goals:** The update promises more opportunities for community suggestions, bug fixes, and feature contributions, increasing the project’s transparency and robustness. This effort aligns with wider trends in Microsoft’s approach to open-source software.
- **Resources:** The announcement provides links to both a GitHub discussion and comments on Reddit for ongoing updates and community input.

### Implications

This phased approach aims to lower barriers for external contributors, adopt best practices from the open-source community, and ensure sustainable and secure development for WinUI.
