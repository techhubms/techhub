# Enhance Your Azure Resiliency with Intelligent Agent and Copilot Innovations

At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Azure unveiled a set of expanded resiliency capabilities designed to help organizations achieve uninterrupted business continuity. The highlight is the preview of the resiliency agent in Azure Copilot, leveraging AI-powered automation to assess, remediate, and continuously monitor your cloud environments for resilience and security.

## Azure Copilot Resiliency Agent

- **Natural Language Guidance:** Interact with the agent using conversational queries to assess current resiliency posture, identify gaps, and receive intelligent automation suggestions.
- **Automated Remediation:** The agent generates ready-to-run scripts and commands that address single points of failure (e.g., resources only in one availability zone), enabling architecture improvement with minimal operational friction.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular posture checks and validations through built-in failure scenario drills (simulated zone outages, failover plans) strengthen your environment's high availability.

## Infrastructure Resiliency

- **Guided Zonal Resilience:** At-scale architecture and service group views expose resiliency gaps and help prioritize remediation.
- **Automated Failover:** Predefined recovery plans and one-click drills automate failover execution across availability zones. Real-time monitoring tracks key performance metrics and provides attestation reports for compliance.
- **Operational Excellence:** Proactive insights and continuous validation lower complexity—high availability is achieved by design.

## Data Resiliency and Disaster Recovery

- **Application-Centric Azure Backup:** Vaulted backups for ADLS Gen2, agentless backup for Windows/Linux VMs, and crash-consistent multi-disk protection support high-frequency, low-overhead coverage for critical workloads.
- **Coverage Summaries:** The resiliency agent delivers backup and replication status across regions; granular recovery and long-term retention support compliance requirements.
- **Site Recovery Enhancements:** Azure Site Recovery now offers alternative VM sizes, expanded disk support (Premium SSD v2, Ultra Disks), increased data churn handling (500 MB/s per VM), and flexible failback between Azure VMs and on-prem Hyper-V.
- **Business Continuity Guidance:** The agent recommends next steps for resources needing cross-region replication and tracks Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO).

## Cyber Recovery and Security Integration

- **Vault Soft Delete & Immutability:** Default protection across Recovery Services Vaults secures backups against deletion or ransomware. The agent monitors safeguard settings and issues automated recommendations/scripts for missing protection.
- **AI-Powered Threat Detection:** Azure Backup integrates with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, automatically analyzing backup health at snapshot creation, enabling proactive security posture improvement.
- **Conversational Security Reports:** Use Copilot interface to query backup security status and enable instant remediation through agent guidance.
