# Announcing Hybrid Deployment Options for Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop now supports hybrid environments, allowing organizations to deliver Windows desktops and applications on both Azure cloud and on-premises infrastructure. Launched in 2019, Azure Virtual Desktop has continually evolved to address remote and distributed work needs.

## What’s New: Hybrid Capability

The new limited preview of Azure Virtual Desktop for hybrid environments lets customers run virtual desktops and applications using their own datacenters. This is enabled by integrating Azure Arc and Azure Virtual Desktop components. On-premises VMs connect directly to Azure’s management services, supporting regulatory and performance requirements while providing a straightforward path to future cloud migration.

### Key Features

- **Run desktops and apps on-premises and in Azure**
- **Azure Arc integration for unified management**
- **Leverage existing hardware and preferred hypervisors**
- **Unified identity, policy, and VM management across hybrid estate**
- **Flexible lifecycle management via partner and alternative solutions**

## Partner Integrations

Several partners are supporting and extending Azure Virtual Desktop for hybrid environments:

- **ControlUp:** Real-time monitoring and analytics for hybrid environments
- **LoginVSI:** Automated testing and management for Azure Virtual Desktop deployments
- **Nerdio:** Centralized management of desktops—cloud, on-premises, or both
- **Nutanix:** Support for large-scale deployments on-premises and across Azure

### Partner Testimonials

- “Our testing and management solutions support reliable hybrid deployments.” — LoginVSI
- “Nerdio Manager is extending cloud automation to more platforms.” — Nerdio
- “Nutanix Cloud Clusters and Azure Virtual Desktop hybrid unlock requested capabilities.” — Nutanix

## Benefits of Hybrid Azure Virtual Desktop

- **Maximize the value of existing infrastructure while providing migration options**
- **Optimize management and monitoring across environments**
- **Custom lifecycle management choices, including partner solutions**
- **Support for compliance, data residency, and performance requirements**

> “Azure Virtual Desktop for hybrid environments provides a foundation for customers to run VDI on-premises or in the cloud. Combined with partner solutions, it gives customers new ways to optimize management.” — Scott Manchester, Microsoft
