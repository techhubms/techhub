Snehith from Microsoft introduces the new Arc-based discovery capability in Azure Migrate, enabling streamlined cloud migration readiness and savings analysis for your hybrid resources.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Accelerate Cloud Migration with Azure Arc Resource Discovery in Azure Migrate (Preview)

**Author:** Snehith (Microsoft)

## Overview

Azure Arc is widely used for managing hybrid IT estates, allowing organizations to extend Azure services to workloads running anywhere. With the new preview capability—Arc-based discovery in Azure Migrate—you can quickly evaluate migration readiness and savings for Arc-enabled servers and SQL Server instances without needing new on-premises deployments.

## What's New

- **Arc-Based Discovery** leverages your existing Arc-enabled resources for migration assessment.
- Instantly assess migration readiness for Azure targets like:
  - Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
  - Azure SQL Database
  - Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Gain insights into savings for different migration strategies without additional infrastructure.

## Getting Started

1. Go to **Azure Arc Center** and create a migration project.
2. Scope your Arc-enabled resources by subscription.
3. No extra on-premises setup is needed—all assessments use data already collected by Arc.

## Key Features

- **Migration Readiness Assessments:** Identify readiness issues and recommend suitable Azure SKUs.
- **Business Cases:** Compare current total cost of ownership (TCO) with Azure and highlight savings via Reserved Instances, Azure Hybrid Use Benefits, and Extended Security Updates for end-of-life workloads.
- **Sustainability Impact:** Estimate environmental benefits of migration.
- **Custom Assessments:** Optionally, deploy the Azure Migrate Collector VM extension to gather performance data for more accurate recommendations.

- [Official Documentation: Arc Resource Discovery in Azure Migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-arc-resource-discovery?view=migrate)

## Summary

Azure Migrate’s Arc-based discovery simplifies cloud migration by streamlining business case analysis and readiness assessment for hybrid environments. Users can plan and optimize migrations with actionable insights directly from their existing Arc-enabled resources.
