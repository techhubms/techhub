## Overview

baunegaard shares practical experience from maintaining an ASP.NET website that combines MVC and Razor Pages, supported by a custom frontend architecture based on Webpack.

## Minimal Template Repository

The author has extracted the essential components of their approach into standalone packages and created a minimal template repository: [AspNet.Frontends on GitHub](https://github.com/Baune8D/AspNet.Frontends).

## Key Features

- **Modern Frontend Build**: Utilizes Webpack for bundling and asset management.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Does not enforce directory structures or specific configurations, allowing for easy project adaptation.
- **Focused on Essentials**: Aims to offer just the basics needed to get started without unnecessary complexity.
- **Customizable**: Users can further customize the Webpack setup as needed.

## Use Cases

- Streamlined setup for new ASP.NET MVC or Razor Pages projects wishing to adopt a modern frontend workflow.
- Transitioning legacy projects to use current best practices in asset bundling and JavaScript development.

## Community Feedback

baunegaard invites feedback and suggestions from the developer community to further evolve the repository and adapt to diverse developer requirements.

## Conclusion

This template offers a pragmatic foundation for .NET web projects seeking an up-to-date frontend tooling experience, allowing teams to modernize with minimal overhead.
