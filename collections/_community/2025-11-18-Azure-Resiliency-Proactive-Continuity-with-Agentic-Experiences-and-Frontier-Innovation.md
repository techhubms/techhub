# Azure Resiliency: Proactive Continuity with Agentic Experiences and Frontier Innovation

## Introduction

Azure's upgraded resiliency capabilities help organizations anticipate and withstand disruptions, embedding operational continuity throughout cloud workloads. The newest innovation, the Azure Copilot resiliency agent, brings AI-driven processes to proactively detect vulnerabilities, automate backups, and integrate cyber recovery, including ransomware protection.

## From Azure Business Continuity Center to Holistic Resiliency

Azure Business Continuity Center (ABCC) is now evolving into comprehensive resiliency capabilities within Azure. This includes new dashboards, actionable recommendations, and easy access to automated remediation directly in the Azure Portal. These features unify backup, disaster recovery, and broader resilience strategies.

## Three Pillars of Azure Resiliency

- **Infrastructure Resiliency:** Use built-in redundancy and zonal/regional management to keep workloads operational during disruptions. The Azure Copilot resiliency agent automates posture checks, risk detection, and remediation.
- **Data Resiliency:** Automated backups and disaster recovery help meet RPO/RTO compliance requirements for Azure, on-premises, and hybrid deployments.
- **Cyber Recovery:** Isolated vaults, immutable backups, and AI insights protect against ransomware and accelerate rapid restoration.

Organizations can adopt a lifecycle mindset: continuity isn’t just a checklist, but a living capability that adapts to business needs.

## Lifecycle Approach: Start, Get, Stay Resilient

- **Start Resilient:** Proactively design resilient workloads with guided experiences, automated posture assessments, and architecture validation.
- **Get Resilient:** Estate-wide visibility and automated risk/configuration assessments enable identification of blind spots, remediation of vulnerabilities, and easier implementation of resilient-by-default architectures.
- **Stay Resilient:** Ongoing validation, monitoring, and improvement are supported by automated failure simulations, real-time monitoring, and attestation reporting. Continuous posture validation and one-click failover ensure readiness against evolving threats.

## Best Practices for Continuity

- Architect for high availability using multiple zones/regions, prioritizing critical workloads.
- Automate recovery processes with Azure Site Recovery and failover playbooks.
- Use integrated zonal experiences to uncover vulnerability gaps and receive recommendations.
- Validate recovery using Chaos Studio outages simulations.
- Monitor posture metrics (SLAs, RPO/RTO) with Azure Monitor and Policy, iteratively improving.
- Leverage Copilot resiliency agent for AI-driven posture assessments, remediation scripts, cost analysis, and operational streamlining.

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Azure’s resiliency features unify infrastructure protection, data recovery, and cyber defense, guiding your organization from initial deployment to continual readiness. Teams benefit from accelerated improvements, reduced manual workload, and continuous operational continuity.
