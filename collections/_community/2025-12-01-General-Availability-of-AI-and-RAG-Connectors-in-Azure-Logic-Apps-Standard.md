# General Availability of AI and RAG Connectors in Azure Logic Apps Standard

Azure Logic Apps Standard now features comprehensive, generally available **AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities. This release introduces out-of-the-box support for document processing, semantic retrieval, embeddings, and grounded reasoning directly in workflow automation.

## Available AI Connectors

**Logic Apps Standard** offers four primary, AI-focused connectors:

### 1. Azure OpenAI Connector

- **Actions:**
    - Get an embedding
    - Get chat completions
    - Get chat completions using prompt templates
    - Get completion
    - Get multiple chat completions
    - Get multiple embeddings
- **Use cases:**
    - Integrate natural language understanding and structured AI responses
    - Enable guided decisioning, user-facing assistants, semantic search, classification, and routing tasks

### 2. Azure AI Search Connector

- **Actions:**
    - Index documents
    - Delete documents
    - Search vectors (including natural language)
    - Merge documents
    - Agentic retrieval output (Preview)
- **Use cases:**
    - Hybrid semantic and vector search embedded in workflows
    - Retrieval of enterprise data for grounding AI responses

### 3. Azure AI Document Intelligence Connector

- **Action:**
    - Analyze document
- **Use cases:**
    - Extract structured data from diverse formats (PDFs, images, forms)
    - Kick off validation, downstream process automation, or content enrichment

### 4. AI Operations Connector

- **Actions:**
    - Chunk text with metadata
    - Parse document with metadata
- **Use cases:**
    - Transform unstructured documents into structured, enriched content for semantic search and embeddings
    - Page-level, token-aware chunking for optimal AI workflow preparation

## Agentic and Advanced AI Orchestration

**AgentLoop integration** allows AI models within Logic Apps Standard to orchestrate workflow actions iteratively, enabling document intelligence agents, assistants based on RAG approaches, and advanced evaluators through multi-step reasoning and automation.

## Key Takeaways

- Native AI functionality can now be embedded directly in automation workflows without added infrastructure.
- Teams can streamline document-heavy tasks, enhance workflow intelligence, and explore advanced agentic patterns.
- All capabilities are generally available, ready for production integration.
