# Microsoft's Role in Open-Source Sustainability: From Kernel to Copilot at All Things Open 2025

*By Lachlan Evenson*

The open-source community is facing significant challenges as unpaid maintainers support software critical to our technology infrastructure. Lachlan Evenson, leading Microsoft's open-source strategy, explains how Microsoft is tackling these problems by investing in community health, sponsoring events like All Things Open 2025, and actively contributing code and resources.

## The Open-Source Crisis

- **60% of maintainers are unpaid** and struggling with sustainability
- **58% of maintainers consider quitting** due to burnout
- **90% of enterprises depend on open source**, but corporate investment rarely supports maintainers directly
- Microsoft commits to actively addressing community needs and sustainability

## Microsoft's Open-Source Journey

- Transition from open-source consumer to major contributor
- Investments through GitHub, Azure credits, direct support (e.g., Alpha Omega)
- Projects and technologies: contributions to Linux kernel, CNCF projects, cloud-native platforms

## What’s Happening at All Things Open 2025
