# Intelligent Real-Time Video Insights and Agents with Azure AI Video Indexer: Public Preview

Azure AI Video Indexer, enabled by Azure Arc, now launches its live video analysis features in public preview. Organizations can extract actionable insights from live video feeds locally, benefiting from ultra-low latency and full data privacy, while maintaining centralized control through Azure Arc.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Insights**: Instantly analyze live video for operational decision-making and situational awareness, enabling proactive reactions in dynamic environments.
- **Edge-Native Deployment**: Process and analyze video entirely on-premises on Azure Local or Arc-connected Kubernetes infrastructure for privacy and compliance.
- **Agentic Intelligence**: Employ specialized AI agents—such as RetailOps, Customer Service, Sales Recommendations, Security, and Event Investigation—for targeted video analytics across industries.
- **Custom AI Models**: Users can define detection logic and build tailored models using natural language, easily uploading images and negative examples for fine-tuned event/object detection—no coding required.
- **Conversational Interface**: The AI Video Assistant enables chat-based queries for operational, security, or incident analysis, transforming live video into actionable intelligence for teams.
- **Scalability**: Manage multiple locations centrally; extend capabilities with Azure Arc for consistent performance across distributed environments.
- **Proactive Operations**: Automate notifications and reporting to respond to anomalies and optimize outcomes in real time.

## Architecture and Privacy

Azure AI Video Indexer’s live video analysis is built for edge scenarios. By processing all video data locally—leveraging Foundry Local Gen AI models, VLMs, SLMs, and LLMs—this solution ensures compliance, data privacy, and minimal latency. No sensitive data leaves the organization's site; operations are managed centrally via Azure Arc, allowing scalability without compromising privacy.

The agent-based modular architecture powers vertical-specific use cases (retail, manufacturing, public safety) and enables rich, conversational access to insights with the AI Video Assistant. For example:

- Retail managers ask about staffing and safety in stores
- Safety officers monitor compliance in manufacturing
- Investigators reconstruct event chains after incidents

Custom AI model creation is accessible via both API and portal, allowing non-technical users to rapidly deploy new detectors through simple natural language descriptions.

## Use Cases

- **Manufacturing**: Enhance quality and safety by monitoring equipment and personnel compliance in real time.
- **Retail**: Track store conditions, customer experiences, and product engagement, aided by agents for stock and safety management.
- **Public Safety**: Quickly detect threats or reconstruct incidents for rapid response.
