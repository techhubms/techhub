Nikita_Nallamothu details how Azure Load Testing now uses AI to automate load test scripting and provide actionable analysis, changing how engineers approach performance testing.<!--excerpt_end-->

# AI-Powered Innovations in Azure Load Testing

## Overview

Performance testing is key to delivering robust applications at scale. Azure Load Testing introduces AI-driven features that reduce manual effort, enable intelligent test authoring, and streamline analysis and troubleshooting of performance data.

---

## AI-Assisted Authoring of JMeter Scripts

Traditionally, crafting realistic JMeter load test scripts required:

- Setting correlations for dynamic values
- Proper parameterization of test data
- Smart use of think times to simulate real users
- Detailed configuration and domain expertise

**With Azure Load Testing’s new AI-assisted authoring:**

- Engineers record their scenario via a browser extension
- AI recommends correlations to handle session and dynamic values
- Inputs are auto-parameterized for realistic data
- Requests are labeled and organized for easy flow management
- Appropriate think times are suggested, matching observed user behavior

The result is a production-ready JMeter script generated automatically, ready for execution on Azure Load Testing’s cloud platform. This capability removes many barriers for teams building complex or large-scale performance tests rapidly.

## AI-Powered Actionable Insights

Running load tests is just the start—understanding and reacting to results is more valuable. Azure Load Testing now leverages AI to analyze results and guide engineers, including:

- **Failed Run Insights:** AI inspects logs, identifies root causes of failures, and gives targeted remediation advice.
- **Baseline Comparison:** Engineers can review performance changes across test runs and pinpoint requests that diverge from expected outcomes.
- **Criteria-Focused Recommendations:** If pass/fail thresholds are missed, AI suggests clear next steps, shortening troubleshooting loops.

This means developers spend less time on manual graph inspection and more time on actionable fixes.

## Getting Started & Next Steps

- The AI-powered authoring feature launches in a few weeks.
- The [AI-powered insights feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-testing/load-testing/how-to-analyze-test-results-using-actionable-insights) is available now for Azure Load Testing users.
- Feedback is welcomed via [this form](https://aka.ms/malt-feedback).

---

## Summary

Azure Load Testing’s integration of AI assists engineers in:

- Creating complex performance tests with minimal manual effort
- Troubleshooting issues via AI-driven log analysis
- Automatically comparing test outcomes and taking corrective actions

These capabilities enable teams to build more reliable and scalable applications without a steep learning curve in scripting or debugging performance issues.
