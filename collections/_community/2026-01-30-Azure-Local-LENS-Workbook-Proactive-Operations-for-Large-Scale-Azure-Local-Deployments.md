# Azure Local LENS Workbook—Deep Insights at Scale, in Minutes

*Author: Neil_Bird*

Azure Local LENS is a community-driven, free Azure Workbook designed to enable operations teams and architects to gain comprehensive, actionable visibility across large fleets of Azure Local deployments. As organizations expand from managing a handful of Azure Local instances to hundreds or thousands across different industries and geographies, the challenge moves from troubleshooting isolated issues to uncovering patterns that affect the entire fleet.

## Key Challenges Addressed

- **Scale**: Efficiently monitor and manage hundreds or thousands of Azure Local instances.
- **Consistency**: Standardize operational dashboards, health, and compliance checks organization-wide.
- **Insight**: Quickly visualize fleet-level patterns, fluctuations, outliers, and deployment trends.
- **Actionability**: Rapidly prioritize operational focus on update compliance, health, and capacity planning.

## Who Should Use Azure Local LENS?

- Central operations teams or SREs managing distributed Azure Local resources
- Architects seeking aggregated insights into cloud/hybrid workloads
- Anyone needing estate-wide health, trend, and compliance views across Azure Local

## Main Features

- **Fleet-First Design**: Begin with an overview of your entire Azure Local estate, then drill down to the details of specific clusters or sites.
- **Seven Dashboard Tabs**: Covering health, updates, trends, compliance, and instance-level insights.
- **Aligned Operational Reporting**: Ensure updates and health checks are compared on a standard baseline.
- **Actionable Data**: Highlight outlier resources and provide direct links to remediation workflows in the Azure Portal.

## Insights Delivered

- **Fleet Overview & Status**: View the number, connection, health, and update status of all Azure Local instances.
- **Workload Trends**: Track deployment variances of Azure Local VMs and AKS Arc clusters.
- **Operational Issues**: Surface recurring failures, extension errors, or connectivity gaps.
- **Update Compliance**: Analyze solution and SBE update rates and benchmark update durations (average, deviation, percentiles).
- **Drilldown Workflow**: After identifying an anomaly, access deep-dive, instance-level dashboards for remediation steps.

## Deployment and Getting Started

- Access the Azure Local LENS workbook and step-by-step deployment instructions here: [https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS](https://aka.ms/AzureLocalLENS)
- The project is open-source, hosted on GitHub, and ready for contributions and feedback.
- Most environments can deploy and start leveraging insights in minutes, with instructions to customize for your organization’s needs.

## Practical Uses

- **Weekly Reviews**: Standardize the monitoring of outlier instances and evolving trends.
- **Update Planning**: Prioritize updates and maintenance based on real compliance and health data.
- **Baseline Validation**: Detect clusters that deviate from organizational norms—potentially due to configuration, policy, or environmental drift.
- **Incident Response**: Quickly drill into failing or disconnected resources and follow remediation workflows.
