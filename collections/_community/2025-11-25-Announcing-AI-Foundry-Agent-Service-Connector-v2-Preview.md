# Announcing AI Foundry Agent Service Connector v2 (Preview)

**Author: KentWeareMSFT**

## Overview

Microsoft has released updates to the AI Foundry Agent Service connector for Azure Logic Apps. This enhancement facilitates seamless enterprise integration with AI Foundry Agent APIs, allowing organizations to securely incorporate advanced AI into their business workflows without custom code. The improvements focus on deployment simplicity, governed connectivity, and global scalability.

## Key Benefits

- **Secure, governed integration:** Enterprises can now connect AI Foundry Agents to their business processes securely using Azure Logic Apps' low-code capabilities.
- **Accelerated deployment:** The connector streamlines the process, reducing the need for custom development and enabling faster deployment.
- **Scalable AI orchestration:** Supports global operations and complex, multi-agent scenarios via Logic Apps and the Agent Loop ecosystem.

## Example Use Cases

- **Event-driven AI processes:** Use Logic Apps' trigger system (e.g., from SharePoint or mailboxes) to invoke Foundry agents when certain enterprise events occur.
- **Document Processing:** Automate workflows by passing new SharePoint documents to a Foundry agent for AI-based processing.
- **Mailbox Agent Routing:** Filter and process incoming emails and attachments via Foundry agents.
- **Agentic Business Orchestration:** Build multi-agent enterprise solutions—Logic Apps can coordinate across the Agent Loop and Foundry agents for advanced, distributed automation.

## New Connector Operations

1. **External agent activity protocol (application context):**
   - Track and manage agent activities for a specific application.
2. **External agent activity protocol (agent identifier):**
   - Monitor and control individual agent actions, supporting auditing and external workflow automation.
3. **Invoke Agent:**
   - Trigger particular tasks/actions in an agent as part of a Logic Apps orchestration or complex workflow.

## Demo

A demonstration is included (see video) showcasing how Logic Apps can directly invoke an AI Foundry agent in real-world automation scenarios.

## Conclusion

The new AI Foundry Agent Service connector makes it much easier for organizations to build secure, governed, and scalable AI-driven processes within their existing Azure infrastructure. With the new operations, multi-agent orchestration, and low-code capabilities, enterprises can unlock more value from their data and rapidly integrate AI into workflows.
