# Arc Jumpstart Drops: Enhancing Community Collaboration for Hybrid Cloud Automation

*By Thomas Maurer*

## Overview

Tech is always evolving, and success requires continuous innovation, collaboration, and a drive for excellence. Drawing on feedback from the community and past improvements to resources like ArcBox, HCIBox, and Agora, Arc Jumpstart Drops represents a significant leap forward in automation and collaborative workflows for hybrid, multicloud, and edge computing environments. This initiative showcases Microsoft's ongoing commitment to innovation and knowledge sharing.

## What Are Arc Jumpstart Drops?

Arc Jumpstart Drops is a community-curated repository of scripts, tools, tutorials, and assets aimed at easing the lives of developers, IT, OT, and Day-2 Operations professionals working with Microsoft technologies. These "Drops" are:

- Small, self-contained pieces of code, automations, tools, libraries, or tutorials
- Designed to simplify tasks and procedures
- Meant to showcase how to build solutions on Microsoft products and services
- Intended to foster a culture of community support and knowledge sharing

## Core Principles and Benefits

### 1. Simplifying Operations

Jumpstart Drops are focused on making everyday tasks easier in complex environments—hybrid, multicloud, and edge setups. Whether you need a dashboard, sample app, script, automated workflow, or detailed instructional tutorial, these resources are crafted to transform how professionals leverage Microsoft's ecosystem.

### 2. Encouraging Knowledge Sharing

At the movement's core is the idea of building a supportive, open community. Contributors are encouraged to share their expertise so others can learn, adopt, and iterate on proven solutions. The result is a continuous cycle of innovation and improvement.

### 3. Community Engagement

By sharing scripts and tools, contributors receive feedback and suggestions from a broad range of peers. This collaborative model not only nurtures learning and professional growth, but also helps collectively improve the pool of resources everyone can access.

### 4. Professional Recognition

Contributing to Arc Jumpstart Drops is a platform for individuals to demonstrate their skills and earn recognition within the technical community. Participation may also aid career advancement and networking throughout the Microsoft and cloud-native ecosystem.

### 5. Supporting Open‐Source Development

All Drops are licensed under the MIT License, enabling open use, modification, and redistribution. This commitment ensures that everyone benefits from each other's work, reinforcing open-source principles and accelerating innovation.

### 6. Earning Badges

Participants have the opportunity to earn [Jumpstart Badges](https://jumpstart.azure.com/badges) as a recognition of their contributions and community involvement.

## How to Get Involved

- **Submit your Drops:** Whether it’s a script, new tool, or an in-depth tutorial, everyone is welcome to contribute.
