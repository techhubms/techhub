# ControlMonkey Introduces AI Agents for Infrastructure Automation

**Author:** Mike Vizard

ControlMonkey has expanded its infrastructure automation platform by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) agents—specifically the KoMo AI extension. This innovation aims to simplify the process for developers to securely provision infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform, regardless of their experience level.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **AI-Powered Code Generation:**
  - KoMo AI agents enable the creation of Terraform code using context-aware data from existing IaC repositories.
  - All generated code is automatically vetted against security and regulatory standards, ensuring compliance and reducing errors.

- **Policy and Guardrail Enforcement:**
  - The platform enforces policies and best practices as code, lowering the risk of misconfigurations and increasing operational consistency.

- **Human-Readable Explanations:**
  - KoMo AI can provide natural language explanations of Terraform code, trace dependencies, explain module usage, and identify misconfiguration risks, making IaC transparent and auditable.

- **Ongoing AI Expansion:**
  - ControlMonkey plans to add more AI agents over time, each varying in size and capability to automate additional infrastructure tasks.

## Addressing IaC Skills Gaps and Security

- Many organizations face cloud skills shortages, especially around secure IaC development.
- By generating secure, compliant Terraform code, KoMo AI removes much of the manual effort and expertise previously required.
- This also helps reduce misconfigurations—a key security concern exploited by cybercriminals.

## Platform Approach

- Combines deterministic and generative AI for robust, context-sensitive code automation.
- Designed to let IT teams decide their preferred level of infrastructure automation.
- Aims to reduce configuration errors and minimize the impact of potential incidents.

## Why This Matters

- As cloud infrastructures become more complex, ensuring secure and efficient deployment through automation and AI is increasingly important.
- ControlMonkey’s AI-driven approach offers a way to bridge skills gaps, enforce policy at scale, and provide transparency for DevOps teams managing critical cloud resources.
