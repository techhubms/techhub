# Debug Faster with GitHub Copilot

*Posted on Jun 20, 2025 by Randy Pagels*

No developer loves debugging—but with GitHub Copilot, you can make it a lot less painful. This post covers four key ways Copilot can help you identify and fix problems faster, so you can spend more time building and less time bug-hunting.

---

## 1. Explain Errors

You can prompt Copilot to interpret confusing error messages. For example, in Python:

```python
# Explain this error and suggest a fix
```

Copilot will break down complex stack traces and offer actionable fixes.

---

## 2. Find Bugs in Your Code

Let Copilot review your functions and spot issues. In JavaScript:

```javascript
// Review this function and suggest potential issues
```

Get feedback about possible logic errors or common pitfalls.

---

## 3. Generate Debugging Code

Need better visibility? Ask Copilot for debug print statements:

```python
# Add debug print statements to this function
```

Copilot inserts logging where you need it, so you can trace what your code is doing at runtime.

---

## 4. Write Test Cases to Catch Bugs

Quickly generate unit tests to catch problems before they hit production. In TypeScript:

```typescript
// Generate a unit test for this function
```

Automated tests help prevent bugs from sneaking in later.

---

## Quick Takeaway

GitHub Copilot can make debugging less frustrating by helping with error explanations, bug detection, runtime diagnostics, and test generation. Next time you're stuck on a bug, let Copilot give you a hand—and stay focused on building great solutions.
