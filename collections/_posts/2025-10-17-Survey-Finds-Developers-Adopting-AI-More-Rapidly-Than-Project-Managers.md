# Survey Finds Developers Adopting AI More Rapidly Than Project Managers

**Author:** Mike Vizard

A survey of 1,129 developers and 50 project managers, conducted by BairesDev, reveals that developers are outpacing project managers in adopting and applying AI within the software development process.

## Key Findings

- **Developers save 7.3 hours per week on average through AI use**, amounting to over a full working day.
- **AI creates 25% of developer code**, highlighting the technology’s direct influence on daily tasks.
- **Most-cited AI benefits:**
  - Faster coding (65%)
  - Accelerated learning (48%)
  - Increased productivity (45%)
  - Quicker prototyping (34%)
  - Higher code quality (27%)
- **88% of developers see AI as a career gateway**, fostering opportunities like automating repetitive tasks and pursuing AI/ML specializations.
- Major upskilling methods: On-the-job training (66%), YouTube (58%), paid courses (48%), but only a minority use formal certifications (15%).
- **44% of developers would like more structured AI/ML training.**

## Project Manager Challenges

- **Slower AI adoption among project managers** due to:
  - Gaps in business/contextual knowledge (43%)
  - Shortage of AI/ML specialists (41%)
  - Lack of internal upskilling (38%)
  - Limited ROI clarity, data privacy/security concerns, and resource constraints
- **Only 15% offer structured AI training for teams**, showing a need for more proactive leadership.

## Developer and DevOps Implications

- DevOps and software team leaders are encouraged to gain hands-on AI experience to design effective upskilling programs and stay abreast of change.
- The survey emphasizes ongoing code review and validation to mitigate risks such as technical debt or security vulnerabilities in AI-generated code.
- The findings indicate AI is shifting from 'if' to 'how much' across software engineering contexts.

## Practical Recommendations

- **Continuous learning**—via self-directed and structured programs—remains critical for teams seeking to maximize AI benefits.
- Project managers and DevOps leaders should prioritize AI training and understanding to maintain effective team leadership in rapidly evolving environments.
