Mike Vizard details how Observe Inc. equips its observability platform with two new AI agents, empowering DevOps and SRE teams to automate root cause analysis, streamline code instrumentation, and use natural language tools for advanced debugging.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Observe Integrates AI Agents to Enhance Observability for DevOps Teams

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Observe Inc. has expanded its observability platform with two artificial intelligence (AI) agents designed to streamline operations and troubleshooting for DevOps and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) teams:

## AI SRE Agent

- **Purpose:** Automates incident investigations by leveraging platform-context to identify root causes and suggest resolutions for critical issues.
- **Designed For:** SREs looking to speed up incident response and minimize downtime.

## o11y.ai Agent

- **Purpose:** Empowers developers to automatically generate OpenTelemetry code required for instrumentation.
- **Functionality:** Enables natural language queries on application usage, errors, and performance, and supports debugging based on collected telemetry data and code structure.

## Technical Integration

- Both agents utilize a graph and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server—originally developed by Anthropic—embedded in the Observe platform.
- This enables seamless data discovery and querying for AI-driven investigation.
- **Supported AI coding tools:** Integration with tools like Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Augment Code, Windsurf, and n8n, allowing developers to access Observe telemetry data directly from their code editor or development environment.

## Value Proposition

- **Ease of Use:** Developers can access observability insights within their existing workflows, without navigating complex UI dashboards.
- **Productivity:** Early access organizations report up to a 10x improvement in issue triage speed—resolving in minutes what used to take hours.
- **Burnout Reduction:** Automating routine investigations helps minimize operational fatigue for engineering teams.

## Industry Insight

- While AI agents are unlikely to fully replace DevOps engineers or developers, they act as force multipliers by reducing repetitive toil.
- As teams adopt more tools powered by large language models (LLMs), these agents help manage the increased complexity and verbosity in modern application codebases.

## Looking Forward

- DevOps teams may ultimately deploy a mix of out-of-the-box platform agents (like those from Observe) and custom-built AI automations for specialized workflows.
- Regardless of automation maturity, human engineers remain central in interpreting and acting on observability insights for high-quality software delivery.
