# Qwiet AI Expands Microsoft DevOps and GitHub Integration for Code Vulnerability Remediation

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Qwiet AI has extended its AI-driven application security platform to improve its integration with core Microsoft DevOps ecosystems. The latest enhancements include deeper connectivity with Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, and GitHub, enabling development teams using these Microsoft platforms to integrate security automation seamlessly.

## Key Enhancements

- **Deeper Microsoft Integration**: Built-in connections to Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, and GitHub allow continuous security monitoring in the popular Microsoft coding environments.
- **Automated Remediation with AI Agents**: Qwiet AI uses intelligent agents to proactively discover and fix code vulnerabilities in real time, reducing risk and accelerating secure software delivery.
- **Expanded AutoFix Features**: The AutoFix AI agents now support analyzing SARIF files for projects and provide policy support for Swift-based applications, extending remediation capability beyond the Microsoft ecosystem.
- **DevSecOps Workflow Modernization**: Enhanced webhook notifications, automated reporting, and secrets configuration improvements enable streamlined DevSecOps practices with better observability and visibility on vulnerability trends.
- **Static Analysis and Software Composition Analysis**: The platform combines SAST with software composition analysis, leveraging AI to scan both custom code and dependencies for security issues.

## AI and DevSecOps Synergy

Qwiet AI's platform addresses the critical challenge posed by the increasing adoption of AI coding tools—which, while improving developer productivity, can also produce insecure code due to flaws inherited from training examples. By focusing on automated and AI-assisted vulnerability discovery and remediation, the platform helps DevSecOps teams secure both human- and machine-generated code.

> "The only way to address issues at scale is to use a platform with trained AI agents to both discover vulnerabilities and automatically remediate them," said CEO Stuart McClure.

Developers are encouraged to remain vigilant, treating code generated by AI tools with the same scrutiny given to human-generated code. Automated security platforms like Qwiet AI are positioned as essential components of a robust DevSecOps pipeline for teams working with Microsoft technologies.
