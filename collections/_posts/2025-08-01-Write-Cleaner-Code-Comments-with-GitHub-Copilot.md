# Write Cleaner Code Comments with GitHub Copilot

*Posted on Aug 1, 2025 by Randy Pagels*

Writing code that works is important, but writing code that's understandable is even better. Well-written comments ensure that teammates—and your future self—can easily follow the logic and intent behind your code.

GitHub Copilot can help you take your comments from vague or sparse to clear and meaningful. Here’s how you can use Copilot’s various modes to enhance your documentation process:

## How to Use Copilot to Improve Comments

### 1. Copilot Chat: Add Explanations

Use prompts like:

```python
# Add inline comments explaining each step of this function
```

Copilot Chat excels at walking through the logic in complex methods and providing understandable explanations.

### 2. Edit Mode: Comment While You Code

Highlight your code and try:

```python
# Add docstrings to describe inputs, outputs, and edge cases
```

Copilot can instantly generate docstrings, which make your functions easier to reuse and maintain.

### 3. Agent Mode: Review for Readability

Ask Copilot:
> Review this file and suggest clearer inline comments where the logic might confuse a new developer.

This is especially useful when onboarding new teammates or preparing for code reviews.

## Extra Prompts to Encourage Better Documentation

- `# Add comments that explain the purpose of each class property`
- `// Generate a top-level comment explaining what this script does`
- `# Add inline notes for this algorithm to clarify performance trade-offs`

## Quick Takeaway

Readable code is about more than syntax. With just a few targeted prompts, GitHub Copilot can help you document your logic as you write, making your code easier to maintain, review, and share.
