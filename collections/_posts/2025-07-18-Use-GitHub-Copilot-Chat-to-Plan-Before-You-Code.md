# Use GitHub Copilot Chat to Plan Before You Code

*By Randy Pagels*

## Overview

Starting a new feature or coding project can be daunting—especially when facing a blank editor. GitHub Copilot Chat isn't just for auto-completing lines of code; it's a valuable tool for planning, outlining, and discussing your implementation **before** you write functions or classes.

## Why Plan with Copilot Chat?

Engaging Copilot Chat in early planning stages helps with:

- Breaking a problem into logical steps
- Surfacing edge cases and hidden assumptions
- Structuring code before jumping into details
- Reducing rework later on

### Sample Workflow

**Step 1: Start a Conversation**

Ask Copilot Chat to outline your approach before you code.

```text
Help me outline the steps to build a login flow that checks credentials, tracks failed attempts, and redirects users based on roles.
```

Copilot typically responds with:

- Key steps in the flow
- Checks and logic needed for security and roles
- Edge conditions you might overlook

**Step 2: Refine with Follow-Up Prompts**

Push further with targeted follow-ups.

```text
Now turn that into a JavaScript function with placeholders for the missing logic.
```

Copilot produces skeleton code, leaving slots for you to fill in specialized details.

## Benefits for Developers

- **Clarified logic**: See the roadmap before getting stuck in implementation details
- **Higher quality structure**: Identify issues up front, not after refactoring
- **Faster starts**: No more staring at blank screens
- **Knowledge sharing**: Share your planning prompts with the team to boost everyone's productivity

## Takeaway

GitHub Copilot Chat is more than a code autocomplete—it's a planning partner that helps you thoroughly map out features before coding. Try starting your next project with a conversation, and notice how much smoother and more predictable your workflow becomes.
