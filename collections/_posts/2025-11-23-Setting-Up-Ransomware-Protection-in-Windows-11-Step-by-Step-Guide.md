# Setting Up Ransomware Protection in Windows 11

By John Edward

## Introduction

Ransomware is a growing threat to all computer users, frequently spreading through email attachments, malicious websites, and fake downloads. While many people believe ransomware targets only businesses, individual users are also at risk of losing important files or personal information. Fortunately, Windows 11 provides integrated tools to help prevent these attacks.

## Understanding Ransomware and Built-In Protection

Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computers, locks or encrypts files, and demands payment for their release. Even paying the ransom offers no guarantee of recovery. Prevention is the best strategy. Windows 11 features several layers of security, focusing on **Controlled Folder Access** within **Windows Security**—a tool designed to block unauthorized changes to your files.

## Step-by-Step: Enabling Ransomware Protection

### 1. Open Windows Security

- Click the **Start** button.
- Type **Windows Security** and open the app.

### 2. Access Virus & Threat Protection

- In Windows Security, select **Virus & threat protection**.

### 3. Locate Ransomware Protection

- Scroll to find **Ransomware protection** and click to enter its settings.

### 4. Enable Controlled Folder Access

- On the ransomware settings page, switch **Controlled folder access** to **On**.
- Provide administrator permission if prompted.

This feature blocks suspicious or unauthorized apps from modifying files in protected folders.

## Customizing Your Protection

### Add Additional Folders

- Built-in protection covers standard folders like Documents, Pictures, Videos, and Music.
- To protect other locations:
  1. Click **Protected folders** under Controlled Folder Access.
  2. Select **Add a protected folder** and pick your desired location.

### Allow Trusted Apps

- If Windows blocks reputable software that needs folder access:
  1. Return to Controlled Folder Access settings.
  2. Choose **Allow an app through Controlled folder access**.
  3. Select the app you trust.

## Activating Cloud-Based and Real-Time Security

- In **Windows Security** > **Virus & threat protection**, click **Manage settings**.
- Ensure these are turned **On**:
  - Real-time protection
  - Cloud-delivered protection
  - Automatic sample submission

Enabling these makes it easier for Windows to detect and block new malware variants more quickly.

## Setting Up OneDrive Backup

- Open **Settings**
- Go to **Accounts** > **Windows Backup**
- Sign in to OneDrive if it’s not already set up
- Enable backup for key folders

This ensures you can recover clean versions of files if ransomware strikes.

## Safe Computing Habits

To further reduce risk:

- Avoid opening email attachments from unknown sources
- Use official download sites
- Apply system and software updates regularly
- Don’t click suspicious links
- Use strong passwords or a password manager

## What If You’re Infected?

If you suspect an attack:

1. Disconnect from the internet immediately
2. Open Windows Security and run a Full scan
3. Check backups for file recovery
4. Don’t pay the ransom; recovery is not guaranteed

## Conclusion

With a few quick setups in Windows 11’s security features and regular safe computing practices, you can dramatically reduce your risk of ransomware infection and data loss.
