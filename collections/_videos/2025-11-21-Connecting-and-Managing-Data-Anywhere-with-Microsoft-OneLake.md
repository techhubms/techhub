# Connecting and Managing Data Anywhere with Microsoft OneLake

**Session Overview**

This Microsoft Ignite 2025 breakout session focuses on how Microsoft OneLake enables organizations to connect to and manage any data source—structured or unstructured—without the need for ETL processes or data duplication. The session features experiences from Chevron and demos by Microsoft staff.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Unified Access Point:** OneLake acts as a single data lake for all users, supporting direct access to multiple data sources and locations.
- **No-ETL Data Integration:** Data from SharePoint, OneDrive, Snowflake, and other platforms can be accessed or shared bi-directionally without moving or duplicating data.
- **Enterprise Security and Governance:** Lake-level access controls, as used by Chevron, demonstrate how organizations can enforce robust security and governance across diverse datasets.
- **OneLake Catalog:** Discover how the comprehensive data catalog enables easy search, discovery, and management of data assets, including support for both Microsoft and third-party integrations.
- **Fabric User/Admin Tools:** Demonstrates how both end-users and administrators utilize OneLake's catalog and security features within Microsoft Fabric.

## Session Chapters Breakdown

- **Chevron’s Experience:** Leveraging OneLake for AI-ready data with effective use of shortcuts for seamless access (0:00)
- **Security and Governance:** Applying lake-level access controls to secure sensitive data (06:11)
- **Shortcuts for SharePoint/OneDrive:** Eliminating data duplication by creating shortcuts to external data sources (16:16 – 21:07)
- **Multi-Endpoint Fabric Access:** Allowing data access through various endpoints, including integration and bi-directional sharing with Snowflake (21:07 – 24:09)
- **Handling Varied Data Types:** Unifying structured and unstructured data handling within a single lakehouse (24:09 – 33:03)
- **Catalog Features and Global Scale:** Exploring catalog support for management, searching, and global scaling (33:03 – 37:14)
- **Live Demos:** In-depth demonstrations of how to use the catalog for data discovery, governance, and security (40:20)

## Key Learnings

- OneLake eliminates traditional ETL bottlenecks for data connectivity
- Enterprise-grade security and governance are built in at the lake level
- Shortcuts allow for rapid access to internal and external data sources with no duplication
- The OneLake catalog simplifies data discovery and management for both technical users and admins

## Who Should Watch
