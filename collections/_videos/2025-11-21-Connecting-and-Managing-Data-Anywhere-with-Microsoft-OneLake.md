# Connecting and Managing Data Anywhere with Microsoft OneLake

**Session Overview**

This Microsoft Ignite 2025 breakout session focuses on how Microsoft OneLake enables organizations to connect to and manage any data source—structured or unstructured—without the need for ETL processes or data duplication. The session features experiences from Chevron and demos by Microsoft staff.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Unified Access Point:** OneLake acts as a single data lake for all users, supporting direct access to multiple data sources and locations.
- **No-ETL Data Integration:** Data from SharePoint, OneDrive, Snowflake, and other platforms can be accessed or shared bi-directionally without moving or duplicating data.
- **Enterprise Security and Governance:** Lake-level access controls, as used by Chevron, demonstrate how organizations can enforce robust security and governance across diverse datasets.
- **OneLake Catalog:** Discover how the comprehensive data catalog enables easy search, discovery, and management of data assets, including support for both Microsoft and third-party integrations.
- **Fabric User/Admin Tools:** Demonstrates how both end-users and administrators utilize OneLake's catalog and security features within Microsoft Fabric.
