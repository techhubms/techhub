# Introducing GitHub Agentic Workflows: Intent-Driven Repository Automation

GitHub is unveiling Agentic Workflows, a modern automation framework designed for repositories in the era of AI coding agents. These workflows are automated, intent-driven, and operate seamlessly within GitHub Actions.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Automation**: Integrate leading coding agents—GitHub Copilot, Claude by Anthropic, and OpenAI Codex—to automate repository tasks based on user intent.
- **Intent-Driven Workflows**: Move beyond manual scripting and event-driven automation to workflows that understand and act on developer intent.
- **Safety and Guardrails**: Agentic Workflows are built with robust security mechanisms to ensure safe operation and protect repositories from unintended or harmful automation.
- **Seamless Integration with GitHub Actions**: These workflows run directly in GitHub Actions, leveraging the existing automation and CI infrastructure.

## Getting Started

- Visit the [GitHub blog post on Agentic Workflows](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows/?utm_source=brand-youtube-vid-description-blog-agentic-workflows-tech-preview&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=agentic-workflows-tech-preview-feb-2026) for a technical overview and setup instructions.
- Begin automating your repositories today by activating Agentic Workflows within your GitHub Actions pipelines.

## Supported Coding Agents

- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-powered code completion and automation.
- **Claude by Anthropic**: Large language model for code generation and reasoning.
- **OpenAI Codex**: General-purpose coding agent for automation and integration.

## Security and Guardrails

- Agentic Workflows are developed with a strong focus on security, providing controls and monitoring to prevent unintended automation or code changes.
- Guardrails help ensure automations comply with organizational policies and industry best practices.
