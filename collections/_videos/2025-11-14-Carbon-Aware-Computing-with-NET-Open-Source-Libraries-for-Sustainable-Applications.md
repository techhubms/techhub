# Carbon Aware Computing with .NET Open Source Libraries for Sustainable Applications

**Speaker:** dotnet  
**Session:** .NET Conf 2025

## Overview

Modern software development faces the crucial challenge of minimizing its environmental impact. This session dives into practical methods to build climate-friendly and resource-efficient applications by leveraging existing Green Software Development design patterns and open source .NET libraries.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Carbon Aware Computing Principle:** Software should align its resource usage with the availability of renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions by shifting workloads and adapting dynamically.  
- **Time-Shifting:** Scheduling plannable jobs (batch processes, background tasks) to run during periods where renewable energy dominates the grid supply.  
- **Demand Shaping:** Adapting application capacity and features to match available resource supply, especially for on-demand scenarios.

## Implementation Strategies

- **.NET Open Source Libraries:** The talk demonstrates how to use libraries like CarbonAware SDK for real-time carbon intensity data, integrate job scheduling with Hangfire, automate workloads using Powershell, and export relevant metrics with Kubernetes Exporter for KEDA & Prometheus.
- **Deployment Environments:** Solutions and demos span across on-premises, Azure PaaS, and Kubernetes clusters—showing flexibility for various architectures.
- **Dynamic Scaling and Load Shedding:** Methods to dynamically scale applications or limit functionality based on power grid carbon intensity are emphasized, alongside techniques to “shed” unnecessary load.
- **Data Integration:** The session covers how to source and consume prediction data about grid carbon intensity for smarter, environmentally adaptive applications.

## Technologies Demonstrated

- CarbonAware SDK
- Hangfire (.NET job scheduling)
- Powershell commandlets (automation)
- KEDA (Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaling)
- Prometheus (monitoring/exporter)

## What You'll Learn

- How to schedule and shift workloads for sustainability (time-shifting)
- Design patterns for carbon-aware job execution
- Ways to automate and monitor environmental impact across development and production
- Applying open source .NET tools for sustainable scaling in cloud and containerized setups
