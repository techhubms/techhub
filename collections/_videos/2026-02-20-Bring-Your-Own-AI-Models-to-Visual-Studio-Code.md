# Bring Your Own AI Models to Visual Studio Code

Presented by the Visual Studio Code team, this session introduces the capability to configure BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) models in VS Code. This allows developers to supply their own API keys and utilize custom model providers—beyond the default GitHub Copilot integration.

## Key Topics

- **Custom Model Support:** Configure VS Code to connect to alternative AI model providers using your own API keys.
- **Integrating With GitHub Copilot:** Continue benefiting from GitHub Copilot but expand your options with third-party or self-hosted models.
- **Local Agents:** Leverage local AI agents that can interact with a range of models, increasing choice and flexibility for developers.

## How to Get Started

1. **Access Relevant Resources:**
   - [Configure BYOK models](https://aka.ms/vscode/109)
   - [VS Code Insiders](https://aka.ms/vscode/insiders)
   - [Live events and updates](https://aka.ms/vscode/live)
   - [In-depth blog post](https://aka.ms/vscode/109blog)
   - [VS Code Copilot Resources](https://aka.ms/awesome-copilot)
2. **Set Up API Keys & Providers:**
   - Enter your specific API keys in VS Code settings as described in the linked resources.
   - Follow provider-specific documentation to connect additional or custom AI services.
3. **Use Local Agents:**
   - Explore VS Code's support for agent-based AI integrations, enabling model switching and customization.

## Developer Benefits

- Greater freedom of choice in AI-powered coding tools and models
- Easily incorporate both open-source and commercial models
- Mix GitHub Copilot with alternative providers according to project or security requirements

## Use Cases

- Organizations with strict compliance or privacy needs can use their own AI models locally or via company-approved providers.
- Developers experimenting with new or rapidly-evolving AI technology can quickly switch providers in their preferred editor.
