# Azure AI Infrastructure Updates for High-Performance Workloads

**Presented by: Microsoft Events, Param Shah, Matt Vegas**

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 reviews the ongoing transformation of Azure's AI infrastructure to support the increasing demands of both frontier and enterprise AI workloads. Topics include:

## Key Infrastructure Innovations

- **Silicon-to-Systems Optimization:** Holistic enhancement of hardware and software integration for AI, from custom silicon to distributed compute systems and networking.
- **Datacenter Advances:** Next-gen cooling technologies, power management, and infiniBand networking (Quantum-2) ensure scalability and reliability for massive parallel AI workloads.
- **Security Enhancements:** Improved threat mitigation and data integrity across hardware and software layers.

## Featured Hardware Platforms

- **NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchips:** Powering the new ND GB200/GB300 VM families, enabling exascale performance and throughput exceeding 860,000 tokens/sec on LLAMA 70B.
- **NC H100 and NC RTX Blackwell VMs:** Purpose-built for robust enterprise-level AI inferencing and training.

## Software and Platform Updates

- **Hardware-Software Codesign:** Coordinated development between device engineering and software stack for optimal performance in AI scenarios.
- **Agent Mode in Microsoft 365 Apps:** Demonstrations include discounted cash flow modeling in Excel and automated content gathering in Word—all powered by coordinated AI agents.
- **Agent Context Transfer:** Techniques to move agent state across applications and integrate external models, such as Anthropic for orchestration.

## Additional Highlights

- **Major Announcements:** Introduction of Work IQ, new features for improved data access methods, and upcoming developer summit details.
- **Interactive Format:** Session combines discussion, live demos, and Q&A, allowing attendees to explore Azure's technical roadmap for AI infrastructure firsthand.
