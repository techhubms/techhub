# Agent: Concurrent Orchestration in Semantic Kernel

Presented by Learn Microsoft AI

## Overview

This video introduces the concurrent pattern in the orchestration of AI agents using Microsoft's [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) framework. The presenter demonstrates how concurrent orchestration enables multiple agents to process tasks independently and aggregate their outputs, making AI applications more flexible and intelligent.

## What’s Covered

- **What is the Concurrent Pattern?**
  - Technique to enable multiple agents to address the same input simultaneously
  - Aggregates diverse outputs for improved results
- **Use Cases**
  - Brainstorming ideas with multiple agents
  - Implementing ensemble reasoning
  - Building voting systems for decision making
- **Hands-on Demo**
  - Coding demonstration using .NET and Semantic Kernel
  - Running multiple AI agents in parallel
  - Collecting and combining agent outputs

## Technical Highlights

- Use of **Semantic Kernel** for orchestrating agents
- .NET implementation patterns
- Support for multiple agent workflow scenarios
- Aggregation strategies for synthesizing agent responses

## Example Scenario

> Need to brainstorm product ideas? The concurrent pattern lets several AI agents generate their own unique ideas in parallel, then aggregates them for richer, more creative output.
