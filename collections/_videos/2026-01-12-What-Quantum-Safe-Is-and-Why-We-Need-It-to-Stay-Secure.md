# What Quantum Safe Is and Why We Need It to Stay Secure

**Presenter:** John Savill's Technical Training

## Introduction

This session examines the landscape of digital security in the context of emerging quantum computing technology. It provides a thorough breakdown of the limitations of classical computing, the disruptive potential of quantum computers, and why organizations must proactively address security threats posed by these advances.

## Classical vs Quantum Computing

- **Classical Computing:** Overview of current computational models and their cryptographic limitations.
- **Problems with Classical Computing:** Challenges faced when relying on traditional encryption algorithms, including looming vulnerabilities.
- **Quantum Computing:** Explains how quantum computers function differently and why their future scalability matters for cryptography.

## The Security Threat: Why Quantum-Safe?

- **Current Encryption at Risk:** Algorithms like RSA and ML-DSA rely on mathematical problems that quantum computers could solve efficiently, undermining security.
- **Quantum Computers Factor Large Numbers Easily:** Classical encryption can be broken by quantum computers running algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm.
- **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later:** Bad actors may intercept and store encrypted data now, intending to decrypt it when quantum capabilities are available.

## Protecting Communications Today

- **Quantum-Safe Cryptography:** Examines cryptographic algorithms and protocols designed to be resistant to quantum attacks.
- **SymCrypt Readiness:** Addresses readiness of Microsoft's SymCrypt and the broader efforts within Microsoft to prepare for this transition.
- **Recommended Actions:** Concrete steps for organizations to assess their cryptographic posture and implement risk mitigation measures.

## Timelines and Industry Response

- **Industry Awareness:** Provides an assessment of current timelines for quantum threats and what enterprises should realistically expect.
- **Microsoft Blog:** References key updates and guidance from Microsoft regarding post-quantum security ([Microsoft article on quantum-safe security](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2025/08/20/quantum-safe-security-progress-towards-next-generation-cryptography/)).

## Additional Resources

- **Learning Path for Azure:** [Azure resources and training](https://learn.onboardtoazure.com)
- **Certification Content Repository:** [GitHub materials](https://github.com/johnthebrit/CertificationMaterials)
- **Q&A Guidance:** Recommends using platforms like Reddit and Microsoft Community Hub for further questions.

## Summary

This video provides a comprehensive yet practical roadmap for anticipating and mitigating the risks introduced by quantum computing. Viewers will understand why quantum-safe cryptography matters and how to start preparing technical controls and business processes now.
