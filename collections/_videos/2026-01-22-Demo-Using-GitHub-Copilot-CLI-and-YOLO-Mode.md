# Demo: Using GitHub Copilot CLI and YOLO Mode

In this demonstration, @shanselman walks through the functionality of the `--yolo` mode in the GitHub Copilot CLI. Traditionally, developers must manually approve each command that Copilot suggests, but with `--yolo`, all tool calls and path accesses are approved automatically. This allows Copilot to execute commands autonomously without user intervention.

## Key Features

- **Bypassing Manual Approvals**: The `--yolo` command lets the agent skip manual confirmations, making the workflow more efficient when repetitive approvals are not needed.
- **Best Uses**: Particularly useful when working in **containerized environments** or automated testing scenarios, where frequent human approvals would slow progress.
- **Caution**: Granting autonomous execution means Copilot has more power, so use it only in trusted, isolated, or disposable environments.

## Example Use Case

- Running installation scripts or repetitive tasks inside a Docker container, letting Copilot handle command execution without stopping for manual checks.

## Why Use YOLO Mode?

- Increases development speed for specific use cases
- Reduces constant interactions for approvals
- Facilitates smoother automation in controlled settings

> "Letting Copilot run autonomously with --yolo drops the friction in development pipelines that rely on repetitive command approvals."
