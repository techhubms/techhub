# Technical Deep Dive: Managed Instance for Azure App Service

## Introduction

Azure App Service Managed Instance is a new offering designed to streamline the migration of legacy ASP.NET applications to the cloud. The service facilitates migration without requiring code changes, directly addressing blockers such as file access, custom installers, and execution of system commands.

### Migration Strategies

- **Eliminating Migration Blockers**: Overcome issues like sandbox limitations, file access problems, and custom installation needs.
- **Configuration Scripts**: Use configuration scripts and containers to automate dependency installation and application setup.

### Security and Identity

- **Managed Identity**: Enables secure communication between App Service instances and Azure Storage, reducing manual credential handling.

### Performance and Scalability

- **Efficient Scaling**: Design strategies for scaling applications cost-effectively and optimizing performance on the Managed Instance platform.
- **Lowering Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: Migrate legacy workloads while driving operational efficiency and reducing cloud expenses.

### AI Ecosystem Integration

- **Leveraging Azure AI**: Integrate migrated applications with Azure's AI ecosystem to enable new innovations, such as using agentic frameworks and AI-powered features.

### Developer Tool Integration

- **GitHub Copilot Tools**: The session announces integration options with GitHub Copilot, supporting AI-assisted coding and deployment workflows.
- **Live Demonstration**: Walkthroughs on setting up Managed Instances, migrating legacy apps, and connecting APIs through agentic frameworks and AI services.
