# How to Use AI Models in Your GitHub Actions Workflows

In this video, GitHub demonstrates how teams can leverage AI models to automate and streamline repository management tasks directly within GitHub Actions. By configuring specific workflow permissions, it's now possible to integrate advanced AI capabilities into continuous integration and repository automation pipelines.

## Key Highlights

- **AI-Powered Bug Reproduction Checker**
  - Set up GitHub Actions to automatically identify and reproduce bugs by invoking AI models, reducing time spent on manual testing.

- **Automated Changelog Generation**
  - Use AI to analyze commits and issues, then generate comprehensive changelogs for every release cycle, improving release communication.

- **Weekly Issue Summaries**
  - Automate the creation of weekly summaries for open issues, helping teams stay on top of priorities and project progress.

- **Documentation Automation with Project Bloom**
  - Leverage Project Bloom and AI to automate production of up-to-date project documentation, saving developers time and improving quality.

## Getting Started

1. **Update Workflow Permissions**  
   - Add required permissions to your workflow YAML files to enable AI model invocation.
2. **Incorporate AI Models**  
   - Call AI models through existing or new steps in your workflows for tasks like summarization, generation, or formatting.
3. **Explore Practical Use Cases**  
   - Experiment with and expand on the provided examples such as bug reproduction, documentation creation, and issue management.
