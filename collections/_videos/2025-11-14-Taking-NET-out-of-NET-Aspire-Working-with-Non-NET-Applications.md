# Taking .NET out of .NET Aspire: Working with Non-.NET Applications

**Presenter:** dotnet

## Overview

.NET Aspire is designed to simplify the creation, observation, and management of production-ready distributed applications. Traditionally targeting .NET environments, Aspire can also support applications not written in .NET, such as those built with Python or Node.js.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Code-Based Modeling:** Define services, resources, and interconnections for distributed systems, regardless of their implementation language.
- **Mixed Technology Stacks:** Practical ways to incorporate .NET Aspire into environments where only some or none of the applications are written in .NET.
- **Integration Patterns:** Tips for configuring Python, Node.js, or other web apps to work alongside Aspire-managed .NET components.
- **Real-Time Developer Dashboard:** Harness Aspire's rich observability and diagnostics even in heterogeneous application landscapes.
- **Local Development and Debugging:** Streamline the developer workflow for multi-language systems with simplified orchestration and diagnostics.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Techniques for packaging and launching distributed systems using Aspire that span several programming ecosystems.

## Practical Scenarios

- Making existing Python or Node.js services observable via Aspire's dashboard
- Unified local orchestration for services written in several different languages
- Ensuring consistent resource configuration and secure service connectivity in a polyglot architecture

## Conclusion

.NET Aspire can be leveraged for complex, distributed applications regardless of tech stack, giving teams the orchestration and observability tools needed to build robust systems beyond the .NET ecosystem.
