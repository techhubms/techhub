# Multi-agent Development in VS Code

In this video, Olivia Guzzardo McVicker (@OliviaGuzzardo) demonstrates how Visual Studio Code supports multiple agent integrations—including local, background, cloud, and advanced AI assistants like Claude and Codex—to help manage and automate a wide range of development tasks.

## What You’ll Learn

- **Agent Sessions Welcome Page**: Introduction to the new workflow for initiating and managing agent sessions in VS Code.
- **Tour of Agent Sessions**: An overview of the different types of agents available and how they work together within your development environment.
- **Parallel Subagents**: How to delegate tasks to several agents concurrently, boosting productivity and streamlining repetitive coding procedures.
- **Managing Agent Experiences**: Explore the updated interface for monitoring, switching, and configuring multiple agents to handle specific development needs.

## Featured Agents

- **Local Agents**: Run processes locally for high performance and privacy.
- **Background Agents**: Automate common background tasks without user intervention.
- **Cloud Agents**: Leverage cloud resources for scalability and access advanced AI models externally.
- **AI Agents (Claude, Codex)**: Integrate with state-of-the-art AI models to assist with code suggestions, completion, and more.
