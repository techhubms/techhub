# Use Copilot and MCP to Query Microsoft Learn Docs

**Presented by:** Carlotta Castelluccio

Discover how to combine GitHub Copilot and the Microsoft Docs Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server tools to enhance your development workflow. This session covers both an overview of MCP and a live demo illustrating how to query Microsoft Learn Docs using a custom Python client.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol and tooling from Microsoft designed to provide AI-powered, contextually relevant answers by grounding responses in official Microsoft Documentation. MCP integrates with the Microsoft Learn platform and facilitates prompt-driven development workflows.

## Using MCP with GitHub Copilot

- **Setup:** The video demonstrates how to set up and connect to the MCP Server, walking through the steps in Visual Studio Code.
- **Querying Docs:** Learn how to use GitHub Copilot with your own Python client to send queries to the MCP and retrieve documentation-backed answers.
- **Demo:** Key moments include a walkthrough of how questions are processed via Copilot and how results are sourced from Microsoft Docs.

## Key Resources

- [MCP for Beginners](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners)
- [MCP Bootcamp](https://aka.ms/mcpbootcamp)
- [MCP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mcp)
