# Accelerating R&D and Scientific Breakthroughs with Microsoft Discovery

*Session: BRK182 | Microsoft Ignite 2025*

## Overview

The Microsoft Discovery Platform is designed to empower scientific researchers by providing agentic AI capabilities – teams of intelligent, collaborative agents focused on advancing innovation. Through a continuous R&D cycle, researchers can orchestrate specialized agents for both complex reasoning and hands-on research tasks.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Announcement and Purpose**: Introduction to the Discovery Platform's vision of synergistic, tireless AI agents supporting R&D.
- **Azure AI and Foundry**: Integration of Azure AI services and Foundry to leverage existing tools and avoid redundant development.
- **GraphRAG Technology**: Advances in GraphRAG for organizing and retrieving scientific knowledge.
- **Science Supercomputer & Quantum**: Usage of quantum computing to accelerate scientific simulations.
- **AI Product Development**: Building internal chatbots and sales tools as initial AI products supporting the Discovery project.
- **Scientific Data Challenges**: Navigating data challenges and defining scientific use cases for agent-based workflows.
- **Report & Simulation**: Running large-scale simulations and generating final reports to inform research outcomes.
- **Broader Impact of AI**: How agentic AI is shaping product design and the future of R&D.
- **Collaboration Invitation**: Encouragement to participate and collaborate in ongoing Discovery initiatives.
