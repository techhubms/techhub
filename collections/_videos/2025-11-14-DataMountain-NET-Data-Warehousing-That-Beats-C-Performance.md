# DataMountain: .NET Data Warehousing That Beats C++ Performance

Pansynchro Technologies introduces **DataMountain**, a data warehouse built entirely in .NET that delivers SQL performance able to compete with and sometimes surpass systems like ClickHouse.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Why .NET for Data Warehousing:** Traditionally, high-end data processing is dominated by systems languages such as C, C++, and Rust. DataMountain leverages .NET's performance-focused advancements to challenge this status quo.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Utilizes recent .NET developments, including:
  - Code generation for efficient execution
  - High-performance structures like Spans and Vectors
  - .NET-specific tricks not possible in other languages
- **Benchmarks:** Internal tests show occasions where DataMountain edges out C++ competitors like ClickHouse.
- **Development Techniques:** Insights into how .NET’s continuous improvements (like those in .NET 10, C# 14, and F# 10) contribute to a data platform's speed and efficiency.

### Additional .NET Innovations Mentioned

- .NET Aspire 13 for cloud-native orchestration
- ASP.NET Core 10 for modern full-stack development
- .NET MAUI 10, Visual Studio 2026, and updates in C# and F#

### Further Resources

- [Official .NET Blog](https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog)
- [Microsoft Learn for .NET](https://aka.ms/learndotnet)

### Conclusion

DataMountain exemplifies how .NET can now rival traditional systems programming languages in high-performance data warehousing, opening new possibilities for .NET developers in the data engineering and data science ecosystems.
