# Modernizing Legacy .NET Apps with GitHub Copilot: Step-by-Step Upgrade

Upgrading older .NET applications presents risks: complex dependencies, breaking changes, and uncertainty over build outcomes. This video delivers a hands-on demo using the GitHub Copilot app modernization agent inside Visual Studio, guiding developers through a structured upgrade process.

## What You'll Learn

- **Assessment**: Analyze your legacy .NET codebase to discover technical debt, outdated dependencies, and compatibility issues.
- **Planning**: Use GitHub Copilot to help map out the migration path, including identifying required changes and dependencies for modern .NET.
- **Execution**: Execute the migration step by step with Copilot's AI assistance, reducing risk and streamlining code updates.
- **Hands-On Workflow**: The workflow is demonstrated on an actual .NET project, suitable for developers upgrading from .NET Framework or early .NET Core.

## Topics Covered

- Assessing legacy .NET apps for modernization
- Generating an upgrade plan with GitHub Copilot
- Executing the code migration to newer .NET versions
- Using Copilot for code analysis and to identify upgrade challenges
- Leveraging Visual Studio extensions and sample repositories
