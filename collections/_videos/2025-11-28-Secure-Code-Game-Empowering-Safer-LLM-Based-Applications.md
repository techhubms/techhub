# Secure Code Game: Empowering Safer LLM-Based Applications

**Presented by GitHub | Featuring Bartosz Gałek & jkcso**

This special episode of Open Source Friday invites contributors Bartosz Gałek and jkcso to explore Season 3 of the Secure Code Game. The episode provides:

- **Overview of Secure Code Game**: An open source initiative teaching secure coding practices to developers and students through challenges focused on current technology trends, especially AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).

- **Safer LLM-Based Applications**: Guidance on identifying and mitigating common security risks in LLM-augmented apps, such as prompt injection, data leakage, and model exploitation.

- **Engineering Decisions**: Discussion around the architectural, design, and code quality decisions made during the development of Secure Code Game, with reflections on trade-offs, lessons learned, and community contributions.

- **Open Source Journey**: Insights into collaborating within an open source ecosystem, fostering developer education, and evolving security training resources to match the changing AI landscape.

## Key Topics Covered

- Threat modeling and secure design for LLM-powered apps
- Secure coding patterns for AI integrations
- Risk mitigation techniques and real-world attack vectors
- Community-driven approaches to developer education
- Tips and best practices for contributing to open source security tools
