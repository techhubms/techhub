# Building Omnichannel Voice AI Agents with Azure

## Overview

This session from Sip and Sync with Azure, featuring Pablo Salvador Lopez and Priyanka Vergadia, demonstrates how organizations—like those in insurance—can create real-time, multilingual customer service bots using Azure Voice AI.

## Key Topics

- **Demo Walkthrough:** Real-world insurance claim scenario
- **Multilingual Support:** Seamless switching between languages (English, Spanish)
- **Intent-Based Workflow:** Automatic agent handoffs for specific queries, e.g., claims or policy details

## Architecture Breakdown

### AI Layer

- Multi-agent orchestration enabling specialized agents for tasks
- Intent recognition and AI-driven conversation management

### Speech Layer

- Integration of Azure Speech Services for speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- Language detection and real-time voice interactions

### Application Layer

- Use of WebSocket and WebRTC for real-time voice pipelines

### Telephony Integration

- Azure Communication Services connects voice AI to telephony systems

### Tools and APIs

- Voice Live API accelerates voice application development
- Multi-Agent Accelerator solution provides reusable architecture patterns

## Best Practices

- Architect for scalability and seamless agent handoffs
- Optimize multilingual pipelines for diverse user bases
- Leverage real-time processing through Azure’s Speech and Communication Services
