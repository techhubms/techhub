# Advancing Mainframe Modernization with Slingshot and Microsoft Azure

**Presented by:** Thanumoorthy Sundaresan & John Weston
**Source:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 | ODSP1409

## Overview

This session demonstrates a modern approach to resolving legacy technology debt in a major US healthcare company by harnessing the capabilities of Sapient Slingshot, AI technologies, and Microsoft Azure. The company transformed thousands of COBOL screens to a cloud-based architecture, achieving a migration speed three times faster than comparable efforts.

## Key Topics

- **Efficiency Gains Through AI-Powered Modernization:**
  - AI tools accelerate screen translation and migration
  - Reduction of manual processes, enabling faster turnaround
- **Two-Step Modernization Process:**
  - Step 1: System analysis and technical specification generation
  - Step 2: Automated code, test creation, and client reviews with AI assistance
- **System Architecture:**
  - Use of FastAPIs for scalable and modern integrations
  - Azure cloud infrastructure hosts new solutions and supports seamless operations
- **Finalization Procedures:**
  - Output file creation and technical documentation
  - Pseudocode generation supports validation and quality controls
- **AI-Driven Input Conversion:**
  - Specifications produced via AI serve as direct input for further development stages

## Impact and Results

- Migration achieved 3x faster than legacy approaches
- Significant improvement in operational efficiency and modernization effectiveness
- Cloud-based architecture enables ongoing scalability and integration of additional services
