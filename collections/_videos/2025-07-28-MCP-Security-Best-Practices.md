## Summary

In this video, Microsoft Developer highlights the unique security challenges that come with using the Multi-Agent Collaboration Platform (MCP) to build and scale AI applications. As MCP enables more advanced and dynamic AI scenarios, it also introduces a range of security risks beyond traditional threats. These risks include:

- **Prompt Injection:** Attackers manipulating AI inputs to achieve undesired results.
- **Tool Poisoning:** Compromising or subverting external tools integrated with AI agents.
- **Dynamic Tool Swapping:** Malicious changes in the toolchain that AI agents depend upon.
- **Token Passthrough:** Unauthorized access to authentication tokens or session data.
- **Session Hijacking:** Taking control of an AI agent's active session to inject malicious behavior.

### Key Strategies Presented

- Identifying threat vectors specific to MCP-powered systems.
- Implementing prompt validation and sanitization techniques.
- Using secure authentication and token management practices.
- Monitoring for abnormal tool behavior or unexpected tool interface changes.
- Leveraging enterprise-grade tools and security modules that integrate with MCP.

The session guides viewers through actionable steps and recommends tooling to ensure that AI systems built on MCP remain secure, resilient, and suitable for use in enterprise environments.
