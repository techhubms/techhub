# Choosing Between MCP and A2A for AI Applications

In this session, John Savill provides a comprehensive discussion on when to use Microsoft's MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform), the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol, or a combination of both for building AI and generative AI applications leveraging LLMs.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to AI Applications**: Overview of the challenges and design considerations when building with LLMs and generative AI components.
- **What is MCP?**: Detailed segment on the Microsoft Cloud Platform—its core features, where it excels, and scenarios it solves.
- **Understanding LLMs and MCP**: How MCP interacts with large language models in real-world deployments.
- **The Role of Agents and Agent Protocols**: Explanation of how agents interact, the need for orchestration, and the emergence of the A2A protocol.
- **A2A Protocol Overview**: Deep dive into the A2A protocol, including the structure and function of agent cards, task coordination, message passing, and artifact management between agents.
- **Combining MCP AND A2A**: When and why you might need both platforms, and the architectural considerations to keep in mind.
