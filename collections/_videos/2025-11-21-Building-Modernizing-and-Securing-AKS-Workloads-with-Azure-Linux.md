# Building, Modernizing, and Securing AKS Workloads with Azure Linux

Presented by Sudhanva Huruli and Dongha Paek at Microsoft Ignite 2025, this session explores strategies to enhance Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) workloads through the Azure Linux Container Host.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction and Rebranding**
  - Evolution of CBL Mariner into Azure Linux
- **Migration Strategy**
  - Seamless migration from Ubuntu to Azure Linux with no extra capacity requirements
- **Performance Improvements**
  - Benefits of a lightweight operating system
  - Consistent, reliable update mechanisms
- **Container Innovations**
  - Running both Normal and Sandbox containers on Azure Linux nodes
  - Deep dive into Kata Container Architecture within AKS
- **Enhanced Security Features**
  - Demo of OS Guard and its role in securing containers
  - Integrity Policy Enforcement (IPE) using the kernel module
  - Implementation of SELinux for enhanced security
  - dm-verity for workload integrity validation
- **Workload Isolation**
  - How enterprises use Azure Linux to isolate and protect workloads
- **Roadmap and Future Enhancements**
  - Planned features: stricter SELinux enforcement, minimal image builds, GPU support

## Security and Compliance Features

- **Integrity Policy Enforcement:** Policy-driven kernel security
- **SELinux:** Mandatory access control for containers
- **dm-verity:** Data integrity for block devices
- **OS Guard:** Kernel isolation for container workloads

## Migration and Modernization Guidance

- Strategies for migrating containerized workloads to Azure Linux
- Benefits in node lifecycle management and performance
