# Assigning Linear Issues to GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

GitHub has added Copilot coding agent to their Linear integration, allowing developers to assign issues in Linear for automated code creation and pull requests using GitHub Copilot. This workflow streamlines collaboration and development:

- **Copilot Coding Agent** automatically interprets Linear issues and converts them into actionable code tasks and pull requests.
- Integration requires the GitHub app for Linear, which brings GitHub Copilot's capabilities directly into issue tracking.
- Developers collaborate within Linear issues, ensuring smoother transitions from planning to implementation.
- This feature aims to boost productivity and unify project management with automation and AI-powered coding solutions.
