# REST APIs, Vectors, and AI in SQL Server 2025

In this episode of Data Exposed: MVP Edition, Ben Weissman, a recognized Microsoft MVP and Data Platform expert, discusses the latest advancements in SQL Server 2025. The episode focuses on three key areas:

- **REST API Integration**: SQL Server 2025 brings native support for REST APIs, making it easier for developers to interact with data, integrate external applications, and automate processes using standard HTTP requests.

- **Vector Data Support**: With the increasing adoption of AI workloads, SQL Server 2025 introduces native vector data handling, allowing storage and querying of vector embeddings. This is particularly relevant for machine learning and AI-powered search scenarios, such as integrating with generative AI models or semantic search within databases.

- **AI Features in SQL Server**: The episode highlights how SQL Server is evolving to support modern AI practices, including running AI workloads, integrating with Azure AI services, and enabling richer analytics directly inside the database.

## Demo

Ben demonstrates how to:
