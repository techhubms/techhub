# A Unified Agent Experience in Visual Studio Code

Presenters: Josh and Osvaldo  
Source: Visual Studio Code team

## Overview

Discover new features in Visual Studio Code that allow you to manage agents running locally, in the background, or in the cloud. This session explores how the unified experience makes it easier to organize and orchestrate development and operational tasks across a fleet of agents—from your own machine to cloud environments via Azure.

## Key Topics

- **Unified Agent Management**: Centrally organize, control, and monitor local, cloud, and background agents from within VS Code using a streamlined interface.
- **Developer Productivity**: Leverage new tooling to automate tasks and coordinate workflows between different agent types.
- **Integration with Cloud Services**: Learn about connecting VS Code tasks to Azure-hosted agents and discover workflow improvements for cloud-based development.
- **Real-World Demos**: See step-by-step demonstrations of registering agents, configuring distributed tasks, and managing operations directly from VS Code.
