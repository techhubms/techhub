# Build Secure Applications with Azure Policy and Service Groups

**Session Speakers:** Jodi Boone, Kemley Nieva  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Session ID:** BRK169

## Overview

Building secure cloud applications requires not only technical controls but also consistent governance and automated compliance. This session teaches how to leverage **Azure Policy** to enforce organizational standards, automate remediation of non-compliant resources, and confidently maintain compliance at scale within Azure environments.

### Key Topics

- **Azure Policy Enforcement:**
  - Define and enforce rules for resource configurations.
  - Continuous compliance checks and automated remediation.
  - In-guest configuration management for deeper policy coverage.

- **Service Groups:**
  - Group related resources or applications for easier policy management.
  - Apply policies at different levels of hierarchy (applications, environments, resource types).
  - Aggregate multiple resources for flexible policy application.
  - Service Groups now publicly available with multi-deployment support.

- **Automation and AI Integration:**
  - Copilot automates resource tagging and service group membership assignments.
  - Intelligent Governance: Leverage LLMs (Large Language Models) to assist in creating robust Azure Policy definitions.

- **Security Management Across Workloads:**
  - Secure Windows, Linux, and database workloads with consistent governance tools.
  - Real-world examples from Microsoft’s own internal governance practices.
  - Learn about the Secure Future Initiative and 'Secure by Default' principles.
