# The Future of Web Development with AI Integration

In this GitHub Podcast clip, host Jason Lengstorf examines how the web needs to evolve in response to the rise of AI technologies. Rather than focusing solely on chatbots, Lengstorf envisions a future where AI agents become deeply integrated into user experience design. He predicts a 'next jQuery' moment—where new tools and design patterns specifically for AI-powered interactions will emerge, dramatically accelerating innovation in web development.

**Key Discussion Points:**

- AI will fundamentally change user experience, making interactions more dynamic and personalized.
- The web's evolution isn't limited to conversational bots; it's about new frameworks for integrating AI capabilities directly into applications.
- Future web development may be shaped by reusable agent patterns and libraries that become as foundational as jQuery once was for DOM manipulation.
- Developers should prepare for rapid changes in tooling and workflow, and continue exploring AI integration opportunities.
