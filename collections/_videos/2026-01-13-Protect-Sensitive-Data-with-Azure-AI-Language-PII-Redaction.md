# Protect Sensitive Data with Azure AI Language PII Redaction

Protecting personally identifiable information (PII) is essential for compliance and user trust. This video introduces Microsoft's Azure AI Language PII Redaction service and demonstrates how it empowers organizations to automatically detect and redact sensitive data across text, document files, and conversational transcripts.

## Why PII Protection Matters

- Data breaches can lead to serious compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA) and loss of trust.
- Industry stats highlight increasing risks and the impact of identity theft.
- Regulatory demands require proactive PII protection.

## Overview of Azure AI Language PII Redaction

- Integrated within Azure AI Language services.
- Automates the detection and masking of PII such as names, addresses, credit card numbers, and more.
- Supports text, documents, and conversational transcripts.

## Key Features and Customization

- **Custom Entity Types:** Select which categories of PII to redact.
- **Masking Styles:** Choose how detected data is hidden (e.g., asterisks, token replacement).
- **Exclusions & Synonyms:** Fine-tune detection to suit specific compliance requirements.

## Demo and Real-World Use Cases

- Demonstration of PII redaction on sample text and files.
- Finance: Protect financial records and transaction data.
- Healthcare: Comply with regulations and protect patient information.
- AI Workflows: Integrate redaction into AI-driven pipelines and conversational systems.
