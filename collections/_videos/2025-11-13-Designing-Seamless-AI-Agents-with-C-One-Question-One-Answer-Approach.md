# Designing Seamless AI Agents with C#: One Question, One Answer Approach

**Speaker:** Mark Miller (Chief Architect, DevExpress; creator of CodeRush & AiGen)

## Overview

Most current AI assistants operate in chat mode—users ask, refine, iterate. This session presents an alternative: the 'one-question, one-answer' model for AI agents in C#. The approach aims for seamless user experiences by providing accurate, context-driven solutions on the first attempt.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Why Single-Question/Single-Answer Outperforms Chat:**
  - Reduces cognitive/UX load on the user
  - Encourages AI to understand and solve the problem promptly
  - More natural and less disruptive in flow-oriented tasks
- **Feeding the Right Context to AI:**
  - Techniques for delivering context instantly to improve result quality
  - Patterns for providing structured and relevant inputs to AI backends
- **UX and Design Principles for AI-Powered Apps:**
  - How to create intuitive, helpful experiences for coding assistants, enterprise tools, and productivity apps
  - Making AI assistants feel like trustworthy partners
- **Proven Development Patterns for AI Experiences:**
  - Real-world lessons from AI agent implementations in .NET
  - Strategies to integrate single-response AI into C# apps

## Who Should Watch

- .NET developers interested in embedding AI
- Teams building code assistants or productivity enhancements
- Anyone aiming to improve AI-driven user experiences

## Takeaways

Developers and architects will gain:

- Practical strategies for integrating AI into C# applications
- UX techniques for making AI interactions more seamless and effective
- Patterns for building trustworthy AI that 'just gets it done'
