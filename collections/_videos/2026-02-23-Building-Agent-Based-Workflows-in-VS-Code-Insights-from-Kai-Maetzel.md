# Building Agent-Based Workflows in VS Code: Insights from Kai Maetzel

In this closing session from Agent Sessions Day, James Montemagno sits down with Kai Maetzel, engineering lead for Visual Studio Code. They discuss the real-world integration of AI and agent-based architectures in Microsoft’s flagship code editor team.

## Key Discussion Points

- **From Pipelines to Actor-Based Workflows:**
  - The team describes their transition from classic software development pipelines to actor-based workflows, enabling more granular automation and flexibility.
  - Actor models allow independent agents to handle specialized tasks, improving the ability to scale and adapt workflows rapidly.

- **Leveraging Multiple Models for Multiple Jobs:**
  - VS Code’s engineering team employs different AI models for distinct tasks within their process, selecting the best-fit model depending on requirements.
  - This modular approach supports experimentation and incremental improvement.

- **Rapid Prototyping at Scale:**
  - Kai emphasizes his hands-on strategy for prototyping new workflows and features quickly, using agents as testbeds.
  - Fast cycles help isolate problems and speed up learning within the team.

- **AI-Driven Evolution of Engineering Practices:**
  - The integration of AI is not just about productivity but also fundamentally changes how the VS Code team collaborates and delivers value.
  - The team is adopting AI-driven automation and decision-making to streamline DevOps and coding practices.
