# AI Fine-Tuning in Microsoft Foundry: Building Production-Ready Agents

## Session Overview

This Microsoft Ignite breakout session explores how fine-tuning in Microsoft Foundry enables the creation of agents that excel in practical scenarios. The session covers:

- Model selection and customization (Azure OpenAI, OSS)
- Synthetic data generation for training
- Tool calling, data extraction, and workflow execution
- Multi-agent strategies for high-quality results
- Real-world applications, including contract repository solutions

## Key Topics and Demos

### 1. Practical Model Fine-Tuning

- Steps: choosing models, generating relevant training data, evaluating model performance.
- Announcement: Microsoft Foundry now supports automatic synthetic data generation for training, simplifying the data preparation process.

### 2. Synthetic Data Generation

- Utilizes Swagger definitions to guide automatic generation of quality data.
- Demonstrated multi-agent collaboration to improve synthetic data quality.
- Example: Creating diverse scenarios for agent training.

### 3. Advanced Agent Capabilities

- Agents are designed for accuracy and reliability in production.
- Demo: Foundry launching RFT using models like GPT-5 and O4 Mini for complex query handling.

### 4. Real-World Application: AI-Powered Contract Repository

- 'Navigator' is introduced as an AI-powered solution for storing and processing contracts.
- Data extraction: AI identifies key contract details and relationships, enabling the processing of millions of documents daily.

### 5. Scalable AI Workflows

- Focus on building agents that perform, not just respond.
- Covers workflow execution and best practices for scaling agents in enterprise environments.
