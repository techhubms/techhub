# Building Omnichannel Voice AI Agents with Azure

**Presented by:** Pablo Salvador Lopez (Microsoft AI GBB Team)

In this demo-driven video session, you'll discover how Azure services enable the development of omnichannel voice AI agents that can handle real-world scenarios such as insurance claims. The session demonstrates:

- **Multilingual Conversations:** Voice AI agents manage real-time conversations in multiple languages, breaking barriers for global operations.
- **Intent-Based Handoffs:** The system detects user intent to facilitate automated agent switching or human escalation when needed.
- **Complex Workflow Execution:** Orchestration of backend processes is handled automatically based on the conversation's context and user's intent.

## Key Architecture Components

### AI Layer

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Coordinates numerous AI agents for different tasks or specialties within a single conversation.
- **Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech:** Utilizes Azure AI Services for accurate speech recognition and natural-language response generation.

### Application Layer

- Integrates real-time technologies like **WebSocket** and **WebRTC** for seamless voice communication and streaming.

### Telephony Integration

- **Azure Communication Services** provide virtually limitless telephony integration, allowing agents to connect with users on traditional phone networks as well as digital platforms.

## Demo Scenario

The showcased case involves an insurance claim, simulating:

- Automated voice interactions for claim initiation and status tracking
- Handling multilingual requests and mapping user input to specific intents
- Backend workflow executions, like scheduling appointments or verifying documents
