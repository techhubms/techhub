# Reimagining Software Development with GitHub Copilot and AI Agents

**Speakers:** Mario Rodriguez, Luke Hoban  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 - BRK105

## Overview

This session demonstrates how organizations with robust DevOps practices can maximize productivity, scale, and security by adopting GitHub Copilot and AI-powered coding agents. Leveraging these tools, development teams can:

- Automate code feedback and pull request (PR) integration
- Manage agent tasks through GitHub Mission Control
- Streamline responses to operational incidents (e.g., SRE agents integrating with tools like PagerDuty)
- Move toward a more open and collaborative development environment with both human and agent interactions

## Session Highlights

- **Impact of Coding Agents**: Productivity and workflow improvements across Microsoft and GitHub
- **Demos**:
    - Cross-device developer experiences with AI agents
    - Using GitHub Mission Control for managing cloud-based agent tasks
    - SRE agents automatically responding to incidents
    - Automating PR feedback and implementation
- **Security & Controls**: Deep dive into Copilot controls and MCP registry options
- **Enterprise Considerations**: Permissions, deployment strategies, and future directions for collaboration between GitHub and Azure DevOps
