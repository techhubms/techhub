# Resilience by Design: Secure, Scalable, AI-Ready Cloud with Azure

**Speakers:** Gargi Banerjee, Molina Sharma  
**Session:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 | BRK217 | Advanced (Level 300)

## Overview

Resiliency is central to building trusted cloud solutions on Azure. This session covers the following topics:

- The foundational importance of trust, security, and quality in cloud architecture
- Treating resiliency as both a strategic advantage and a partnership
- Azure's framework for resiliency, including infrastructure best practices
- Setting resilience goals and simulating failures to orchestrate robust recovery processes

## Key Concepts

### 1. Strategic Advantage of Resiliency

- Resiliency supports secure, scalable, and AI-ready architectures
- Trust and quality are core values for every cloud deployment

### 2. Azure Resiliency Deep Dive

- Framework for designing resilient solutions on Azure
- Principles include redundancy, failover, and disaster recovery

### 3. Infrastructure Resiliency

- Ensuring infrastructure can withstand outages and recover quickly
- Example: Contoso Mart outage, demonstrating the need for robust recovery solutions

### 4. Four-Step Resiliency Journey

- **View:** Analyze current architecture for resiliency
- **Assess:** Identify gaps and risks in existing setup
- **Improve:** Implement changes to increase resilience
- **Validate:** Test recovery and validate improvement

### 5. Live Demonstrations

- Setting up VM backups in Recovery Services vault
- Initiating threat detection for backups

### 6. Shared Responsibility

- Teams play a vital role in ensuring resilience
- Azure enables shared responsibility for secure and trusted outcomes
