# Modernizing Automation with Copilot Studio and Power Automate: Agents and Flows

## Overview

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 explores how Copilot Studio and Power Automate work together to modernize and scale automation in enterprise scenarios. The focus is on integrating agent flows, desktop flows (RPA), and leveraging large language models (LLMs) for resilient automation.

## Key Topics

- **Process Insights and Analytics:** Monitoring automation processes with process maps and analytics for better visibility and management.
- **Agent Flows:** Introduction to agent flows as a new starting point for designing automation, enabling reasoning and LLM-based orchestration.
- **Integration and Conversion:** Guidance on integrating and converting existing Power Automate cloud flows, including orchestration and bi-directional invocation between agents and flows.
- **Frameworks and Entry Points:** Explanation of architectural frameworks for integrating Copilot Studio with other automation tools, and using Microsoft 365 Copilot as an entry point (note: productivity Copilots themselves are excluded from categories, but Copilot Studio is included as a developer/maker tool).
- **Demonstrations:**
  - Reasoning agent performing UI automation
  - Cineplex’s case study for automation evolution and integration
  - Basic agentic automation workflow
  - Advanced example with purchase approval agent flow

## Practical Insights

- Strategies to choose between agent-based and flow-based automation depending on complexity and orchestration needs.
- Real-world use cases showing scalability, resilience, and security considerations.
- How to utilize LLM-powered agents in Copilot Studio for smarter automation.
