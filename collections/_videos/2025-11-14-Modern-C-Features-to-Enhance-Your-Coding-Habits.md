# Modern C# Features to Enhance Your Coding Habits

## Overview

This session by Dotnet takes you through a range of new and practical features included in C# 12, C# 13, and C# 14—each part of recent LTS (Long-Term Support) releases of the language. These often overlooked features, while small in scope, address real-world developer needs and frequently become favorites due to their impact on day-to-day coding.

## Why Focus on Recent C# Features?

- **Continuous Productivity:** Small language enhancements can significantly improve coding speed and reliability.
- **Refresher for All Developers:** Whether you regularly work in C# or are returning after some time away, these updates can modernize your development habits.

## Key Highlights from C# 12 - C# 14

- **Pattern Matching Improvements:** More expressive ways to write conditionals and switch statements, leading to cleaner and safer code.
- **Primary Constructors for Classes:** Simplifies object creation and enhances clarity, especially in immutable types.
- **Collection Expressions:** Smoother initialization and manipulation of collections, making code more concise.
- **Interpolated String Handlers:** Advanced string formatting techniques that optimize performance and readability.
- **Required Properties:** Ensures objects are always properly initialized, helping to catch errors at compile time.
- **Extended ‘with’ Expressions:** Enables easier and safer object copying and modification, supporting better functional programming patterns.
- **Enhanced Type Aliases and Using Declarations:** Organize code for greater maintainability and clarity.

## Adopting Better Habits

- Review your usage of older constructs and refactor where new features can simplify logic.
- Encourage team adoption of these features for improved consistency and maintainability.
- Use LTS releases to ensure access to language stability and support for enterprise environments.
