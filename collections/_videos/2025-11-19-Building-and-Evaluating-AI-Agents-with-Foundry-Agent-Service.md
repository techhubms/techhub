# Building and Evaluating AI Agents with Foundry Agent Service

**Speaker**: Katherin Madche  
**Event**: Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Session Code**: ODSP1411  
**Language**: English (US)

## Overview

Building intelligent AI agents requires robust tools and seamless integration. This session demonstrates how the Microsoft Foundry Agent Service can accelerate agent creation and deployment with the security, scalability, and flexibility of Azure services.

## What You'll Learn

- How to prepare a Function App in Azure with API keys.
- Registering tools and connecting live data endpoints for agent use.
- Integrating Azure Functions as real APIs with agents.
- Using W&B Weave for tracking agent reasoning, input/output, and logging.
- Step-by-step Python-based interaction with your agent.
- Testing and evaluating agent output (e.g., live data queries, such as finding nearby restaurants).

## Session Chapters

- **0:00 – Preparing Function App with API Keys**
- **3:16 – Functions Live for Agent Use**
- **4:38 – Tools Introduction and Dashboard Overview**
- **6:09 – Testing Agent Using 'Try in Playground' Interface**
- **7:40 – Viewing Trace Logs in Weave**
- **8:09 – Displaying Agent Output: Restaurant Results Example**

## Key Integration Points

- **Foundry Agent Service**: Manage, scale, and secure cloud-based AI agents.
- **Azure Functions**: Deploy APIs for agent consumption.
- **W&B Weave**: Track agent workflows, inspect logging, and monitor real-time analytics.
- **Python SDKs**: Scripting and interaction with the agent.
