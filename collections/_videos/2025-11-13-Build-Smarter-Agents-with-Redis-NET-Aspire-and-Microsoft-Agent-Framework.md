# Build Smarter Agents with Redis, .NET Aspire, and Microsoft Agent Framework

Discover how Redis can make Agentic applications running in Azure more intelligent, performant, and collaborative. This session covers:

- **Redis Integration Patterns**:
  - Semantic cache for agent reasoning and retrieval
  - Vector store for efficient similarity search
  - Persistent chat history management
  - Session management for scalable, stateful workflows

- **Key Technologies Featured**:
  - **.NET Aspire**: Latest cloud-native orchestration tools for .NET apps
  - **Microsoft Agent Framework**: Building smarter, context-aware agents
  - **.NET 10 / ASP.NET Core 10 / C# 14 / F# 10 / .NET MAUI 10**: Modern language and framework updates for higher productivity, security, and unified development
  - **Visual Studio 2026**: Enhanced IDE features for intelligent application development

- **Developer Best Practices**:
  - Optimizing agent collaboration through Redis
  - Leveraging robust semantic caching to reduce latency
  - Managing vector data for search and retrieval
  - Maintaining scalable chat and session data for multi-agent scenarios
