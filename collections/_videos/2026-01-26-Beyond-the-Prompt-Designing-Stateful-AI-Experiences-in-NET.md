# Beyond the Prompt: Designing Stateful AI Experiences in .NET

## Overview

AI integration in modern applications is rapidly evolving. This session focuses on designing stateful, context-aware AI experiences using Azure AI Assistants within .NET. The goal is to move beyond simple, stateless API calls and enable intelligent systems that maintain conversational continuity, remember user context, and deliver more meaningful interactions.

## Key Topics

- **Stateful vs Stateless AI**: Understand the limitations of stateless prompt-response models and the value of persistent context in user conversations.
- **Azure AI Assistants**: Learn how to leverage Azure AI capabilities to build conversational agents that adapt to user needs over time.
- **.NET Architecture Patterns**: Explore real-world architectural approaches and best practices for integrating AI with existing .NET solutions.
- **Production Challenges**: Analyze the unique challenges encountered when deploying AI assistants in live environments, including handling context, user state, scalability, and reliability.
- **Best Practices**: Guidance for creating maintainable, robust, and secure AI-enabled .NET systems.

## Real-World Examples

The session features example scenarios where .NET developers utilize Azure AI to create conversational agents, implement context management, and improve user experiences through persistent memory and adaptive responses.

## Featured Speakers

- Saeed Esmaeelinejad
- Katie Savage
- Maira Wenzel
- Scott Addie

## Practical Takeaways

- Strategies for bridging .NET development with Azure AI services
- Architectures for handling state and context in conversational systems
