# Redefining the SDLC with GitHub Copilot and Context-Driven AI

**Presented by Jon Perkins, Slalom**  
Microsoft Ignite 2025 Session ODSP1414

## Overview

Slalom demonstrates transformation of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) using GitHub Copilot enhanced with project context, standards, and design rules. This session shows how context frameworks and AI tools can help organizations embed best practices directly into their code workflows.

## Key Topics

- **Prototyping SPAs:** Using React or Angular with Copilot for rapid single-page application development.
- **Embedding Enterprise Practices:** AI-driven code creation aligned with organizational standards via context frameworks.
- **Tool Integrations:** Connecting Copilot workflows with Jira, Azure DevOps, and Figma for project management and design alignment.
- **Dynamic Context via MCP:** Utilizing MCP servers to inject real-time project context and design rules for Copilot guidance.
- **Slalom Accelerator:** Introduction to asynchronous agentic workflow automation to boost deliverable alignment and developer collaboration.
- **Project Alignment:** Capturing best practices and coding standards from existing projects and embedding them in Copilot workflows.

## Real-World Outcomes

- Boosted code quality and consistency via context-driven Copilot suggestions.
- Enterprise deliverables more closely aligned with human and organizational standards.
