# Debugging Dockerfiles in Visual Studio Code Using the Debug Adapter Protocol

This session, led by Reynald Adolphe, Remy Suen, and Jonathan Sternberg, explores how to debug Dockerfile builds directly within Visual Studio Code. By leveraging the Debug Adapter Protocol, developers can step through build stages, set breakpoints, and inspect the build process, making troubleshooting Docker images easier and more transparent.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Debug Adapter Protocol**: Overview of the protocol and its integration in VS Code for Dockerfile debugging.
- **Step-by-Step Dockerfile Debugging**: Demonstrates how to set breakpoints and step through commands in a Dockerfile during the build process.
- **Practical Debugging Scenarios**: Real-world examples of diagnosing and fixing Dockerfile issues.
- **Integrating with Developer Workflows**: Tips for incorporating Dockerfile debugging into day-to-day development.
- **Presenter Insights**: Reynald Adolphe, Remy Suen, and Jonathan Sternberg share practical advice for effective debugging in containerized development environments.

## Resources

- [Debug Docker Builds with Visual Studio Code - Docker Blog](https://www.docker.com/blog/debug-docker-builds-with-visual-studio-code/)

## Takeaways

- Use VS Code’s built-in debugging tools for a more efficient Dockerfile development lifecycle.
- The Debug Adapter Protocol enhances visibility into the build process, allowing for faster issue isolation and resolution.
