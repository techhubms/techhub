# Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

In this session, Microsoft Developer explains the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard developed to streamline how large language models (LLMs) interact with external data and tools. The presentation covers:

## What Is MCP?

- **Definition**: MCP is a protocol that standardizes the connection between LLMs, data sources, and third-party tools.
- **Purpose**: Developed to overcome integration and context-sharing challenges encountered in prior LLM projects.

## Core Challenges Addressed

- Connecting LLMs to a variety of external tools and data reliably
- Managing and reusing context efficiently
- Enabling safe and precise delegation of model operations

## MCP Architecture

- **Components**: Specifies modular interfaces, security models, and extensibility mechanisms
- **Contextual Reuse**: Allows for easy reuse and management of context across multiple LLM interactions
- **Safe Delegation**: Facilitates secure delegation of tasks to the model, helping organizations maintain control and auditability

## Benefits for Developers & Technical Leads

- Simplifies integration of LLMs with business systems
- Encourages architectural consistency and reusability
- Supports advanced tuning for specific use cases

## When to Use MCP

- Evaluating if your LLM projects suffer from scaling or context management issues
- Considering extensibility and secure integration with external tools

## Summary

MCP provides an essential abstraction layer for anyone building robust AI solutions with LLMs and Microsoft’s ecosystem. This session arms participants with knowledge to assess MCP’s fit in their own projects.
