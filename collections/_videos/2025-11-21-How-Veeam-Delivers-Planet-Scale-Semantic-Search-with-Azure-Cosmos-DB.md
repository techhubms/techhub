# How Veeam Delivers Planet-Scale Semantic Search with Azure Cosmos DB

**Presented by the Azure Cosmos DB engineering team and Veeam at Microsoft Ignite 2025**

## Overview

This session explores how Azure Cosmos DB enables enterprise-grade, scalable semantic search, focusing on new features for developers, AI integration, and high-performance search operations.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Microsoft DiskANN Vector Index for Semantic Search:**
  - Explains the core technology powering contextually relevant vector search within Azure Cosmos DB.

- **Hyper Scale Vector Search with Garnet Cache:**
  - Details about leveraging Garnet Cache to support high-throughput, low-latency vector searches at scale.

- **Security, Scalability, Reliability, and Compliance:**
  - Discussion of strategies to ensure regional compliance and secure data handling across global deployments.

- **System Architecture:**
  - How Azure Event Hubs, Azure Container Apps, Databricks, and Cosmos DB work together in an event-driven pipeline for data refinement, enrichment, and indexing.
  - Breakdown of multi-tenant I/O patterns and shard key strategies to optimize search performance.

## Demonstrations

- **Veeam Data Cloud Admin Console & Project Atlas:**
  - Showcases a practical implementation of semantic search, including:
    - Real-world demo of searching contextually relevant emails.
    - Hybrid search that blends vector and text-based ranking approaches.

## Development and Optimization Insights

- Multi-tenant data handling
- Efficient vector search architecture
- Shard keys for performance
- Data enrichment and indexing best practices

## Why Use Azure Cosmos DB for Semantic Search?

- Unified solution for reliable storage, vector search, and full-text indexing
- Designed for global scale, enterprise reliability, and rapid search
- Built-in integrations with event-driven Microsoft Azure services
