# Next-Level SQL in VS Code: GitHub Copilot GA and AI-Ready SQL

The latest update to the MSSQL extension for Visual Studio Code brings a range of features designed to streamline SQL development and help build AI-powered applications efficiently.

## Key Highlights

- **GitHub Copilot General Availability**: Now fully GA, GitHub Copilot assists in writing SQL code directly in VS Code, including both Ask and Agent modes that enhance contextual understanding of your database workflow—even without an active database connection.
- **In-Product Changelog and Edit Data Enhancements**: Developers can now access update logs and improved data editing experiences directly within the extension, making feature tracking and iterative development smoother.
- **Schema Evolution for AI-Readiness**:
  - Demonstrates evolving a traditional SQL schema into an AI-ready schema using vector data types available in SQL Server 2025.
  - Integrates GitHub Copilot, Python, and semantic search to enable more intelligent data operations and search capabilities.

## Demo Walkthrough

1. **GitHub Copilot in Action**: See how Copilot (Ask and Agent modes) improves productivity by understanding schema, suggesting next steps, and helping with workflow guidance.
2. **AI-Ready Schema Implementation**:
   - Transition SQL schemas for vector support.
   - Leverage semantic search within the SQL database by combining Python scripting and Copilot-powered workflows.
