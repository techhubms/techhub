# Azure IaaS Best Practices to Enhance Performance and Scale

This advanced (level 300) session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 dives into proven techniques for boosting performance and scalability on Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

**Speakers:** Yi Chai, Varun Shandilya, Amit Srivastava

## Session Overview

Azure IaaS enables scalable application deployments by leveraging features like high-throughput storage, low-latency networking, and intelligent auto-scaling. The session covers:

- Optimizing compute, storage, and networking resources
- Performance tuning strategies
- Cost reduction and automation methods

### Key Topics and Enhancements

- **Azure Boost**: Performance enhancements and faster VM operations
- **Compute Fleet**: Efficient workload management across multiple VM types and sizes
- **Azure Virtual Machines**: Latest automation and schedule actions for cost control
- **Storage Solutions**: Latest with Azure Ultra Disk, improved latency and IOPS, distributed storage solutions for AI inferencing
- **Networking**: Introduction to QUIC and HTTP/3 support for better throughput and lower latency
- **Application Gateway for Containers**: Demo of load-aware routing, enabling intelligent traffic management in containerized workloads
- **Hyper-V Advancements**: Direct virtualization for improved performance gains

### Demos and Use Cases

- Load-aware routing in Application Gateway for Containers
- VM automation scheduling to optimize for cost and resource needs
