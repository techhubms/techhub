## Overview

In "Let it Cook - Episode 8: Vibe coding the ultimate MCP install link," the Visual Studio Code team (Sean Roberts, Burke Holland, and Pierce Boggan) collaborate on designing a universal installation link system intended for Microsoft Certified Projects (MCPs). The initiative addresses common developer frustrations regarding maintaining multiple, inconsistent installation instructions across their repositories. By working to create a single, centralized install link, the team aims to:

- Simplify the process for adding installation badges to GitHub or other repositories
- Provide deep link functionality for users who wish to install MCPs directly
- Standardize installation directions across projects

## The Problem

Developers often face the challenge of updating and documenting various ways to install MCPs. Due to different platforms, environments, or distribution channels, instructions can quickly become fragmented and outdated, causing confusion for both contributors and end users. Centralizing this with a universal install link can help streamline onboarding and maintenance.

## The Vision

The proposed solution is a single, reusable install URL that can be:

- Embedded as a badge (shield) in a project’s README
- Included in installation/documentation pages
- Used as a deep link, enabling one-click installation from various environments

This approach seeks to reduce friction for both maintainers and users. Developers will no longer have to track diverse install mechanisms or keep documentation in sync across multiple locations. Instead, a unified install experience will ensure consistency and ease of use.

## Discussion Highlights

- **Technical Feasibility**: Explorations around how the universal install link might be structured to support a range of environments and contexts (e.g., desktop, web, CLI tools).
- **Integration with Visual Studio Code**: Considerations for making these links compatible with VS Code and other developer tools.
- **Improving Documentation**: Making install instructions more accessible and usable, particularly for new contributors or users jumping between projects.

## Featured Participants

- Pierce Boggan

## Conclusion

The episode underscores the motivation for a more unified, developer-friendly approach to MCP installation, promoting ease of use and maintainability across the broader developer community.
