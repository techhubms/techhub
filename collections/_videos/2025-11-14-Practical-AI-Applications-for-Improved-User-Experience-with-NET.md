# Practical AI Applications for Improved User Experience with .NET

This session, presented by the .NET team, explores how AI can be used to innovate and improve application user experiences. The main focus is on practical implementations of Multi-modal Language Models (MLLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) within modern .NET applications.

## Beyond Basic AI Chat

- Move past traditional chatbots and apply AI to solve real user problems
- Integrate multi-modal language models to process and understand user input across different formats (text, voice, etc.)

## Enhancing the UX with NLP

- Use natural language processing to interact with and manipulate existing user interfaces
- Make everyday application tasks easier and more intuitive for users

## Highlights from the .NET Platform

- **.NET 10**: Intelligent, unified platform (See: <https://aka.ms/dotnet10/>)
- **.NET Aspire 13**: Simplified orchestration for cloud-native apps (<https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement>)
- **ASP.NET Core 10**: Secure, modern, full-stack web development (<https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025>)
- **.NET MAUI 10**: Build beautiful apps for every platform (<https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025>)
- **C# 14**: Expressive, productive language enhancements (<https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025>)
- **F# 10**: More functional and safer (<https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement>)
- **Visual Studio 2026**: Faster, smarter developer tooling (<https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement>)
- **.NET Conf 2025**: Celebrate .NET innovation (<https://aka.ms/dotnotconf2025/recap>)
