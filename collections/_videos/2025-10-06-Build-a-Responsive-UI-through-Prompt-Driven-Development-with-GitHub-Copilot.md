# Build a Responsive UI through Prompt Driven Development with GitHub Copilot

**Presented by Visual Studio Code team & Cynthia Zanoni**

## Overview

In this video tutorial, you'll discover how GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code streamlines modern web development. The demonstration centers on enhancing a Notes app’s UI and overall user experience through prompt-driven development (PDD).

### Key Sections and Topics

- **Intro and NoteBoard Review** (00:00–01:00): Quick context and overview of the sample Notes app.
- **Responsive Layout Using Copilot** (01:00–03:40): See how Copilot is prompted to refactor the UI for responsiveness using 'Beast Mode' custom chat settings within VS Code.
- **Adding a Real-Time Search Feature** (03:40–05:10): The video illustrates how Copilot helps generate code for an instant search experience, making content filtering seamless.
- **Generating the Project README via Prompts** (05:10–06:12): Custom Copilot chat prompts are used to generate and refine the project’s README, demonstrating Copilot’s utility beyond coding.
- **Summary & Resources** (post 06:12): Recap of key techniques, further learning resources, and community links.
