# AI & GitHub Copilot: Modernizing Legacy Apps for the Cloud

Led by: **Ayan Gupta** (GitHub)

## Overview

This session explores how teams can use GitHub Copilot and AI-driven agents to upgrade, migrate, and deploy legacy applications quickly and reliably in the cloud. The discussion highlights strategies for assessing codebases, updating frameworks, applying security fixes, and automating deployments, with a strong emphasis on Azure infrastructure.

## Key Learnings

- **Upgrading Applications**
  - Automatically assess existing codebases for modernization opportunities
  - Use AI-assisted plans to upgrade application frameworks and resolve complex dependencies
  - Apply security patches efficiently with automated guidance

- **Migrating to Azure**
  - Migrate legacy and monolithic applications to cloud-native Azure infrastructure
  - Automate configuration, testing, and transformation of applications for cloud readiness
  - Reduce manual errors and streamline resource provisioning

- **Deploying Applications at Scale**
  - Generate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for consistent, repeatable Azure deployments
  - Automate complete CI/CD pipelines from build to production
  - Validate every deployment end-to-end using integrated testing capabilities

## Technologies Covered

- **GitHub Copilot** for code suggestion, automation, and modernization
- **AI-powered agents** for project assessment and automation
- **Azure** for cloud hosting, migration targets, and automation
- **Java and .NET** as examples of modernized application platforms
- **DevOps practices** for workflow automation, pipeline generation, and infrastructure management

## Practical Benefits

- Reduce time and risk associated with migration and modernization
- Improve security posture through automated fixes
- Enable developers to leverage AI for more efficient cloud adoption

## Who Should Watch

- Developers working with legacy or monolithic codebases
- Teams planning migration or modernization projects to Azure
- DevOps engineers interested in automating transformation workflows
- Anyone exploring AI-assisted development for faster cloud delivery
