# How TypeScript's Creator Uses AI for Team Productivity

**Featured Speaker:** Anders Hejlsberg (TypeScript creator)

In this video, Anders Hejlsberg describes the practical benefits the TypeScript team enjoys by integrating AI into their development processes. A key example highlighted is the use of AI to automate the tedious and repetitive work of porting hundreds of pull requests from an old codebase to a new one.

## Key Points

- **AI as a Productivity Booster:** AI helps eliminate 'toil'—the repetitive tasks that slow down team progress.
- **Real-World Example:** The TypeScript team uses AI-driven automation to port pull requests, greatly reducing manual effort and error rates.
- **Advice for Developers:** Identify uninteresting or routine work in your workflow and use automation or AI solutions to handle it.
- **Broader Context:** This approach reflects a growing trend among software teams to use AI for streamlining cumbersome processes.
