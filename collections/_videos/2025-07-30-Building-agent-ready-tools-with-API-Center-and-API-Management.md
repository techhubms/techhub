# Building Agent-Ready Tools with API Center and API Management

## Overview

Microsoft Developer presents a detailed session on building agent-ready tools using Azure API Center, API Management, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The talk explores evolving API Management capabilities for working with remote MCP servers and constructing centralized MCP registries to streamline developer workflows:

- **Latest in API Management**: Learn how Azure API Management now supports exposure and management of remote MCP servers, enabling new integration paradigms.
- **Creating a Centralized MCP Registry**: Discover how you can create and maintain a central registry for MCP servers, supporting effective discovery for developers and agents.
- **Azure API Center as Private MCP Registry**: Explore how Azure API Center serves as a private MCP registry, offering features for API governance, discovery, and lifecycle management.
- **API Governance in the Cloud**: Gain insight into comprehensive API governance using these Microsoft tools, and how they facilitate secure, scalable, and maintainable API ecosystems.

## Key Takeaways

- **API Management for Remote Servers**: Understand the new capabilities in API Management for exposing and managing remote MCP servers.
- **Centralized API Discovery**: See how a custom or private MCP registry improves API discovery and usability for agent integration.
- **Integrating MCP Tools with Custom Agents**: Find out how Azure AI Foundry’s Agent Service can integrate MCP tools into custom agent workflows.
