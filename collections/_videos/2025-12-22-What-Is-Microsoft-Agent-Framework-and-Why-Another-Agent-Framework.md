# What Is Microsoft Agent Framework & Why Another Agent Framework?

In this video, Learn Microsoft AI explains the purpose, structure, and benefits of the Microsoft Agent Framework—the latest open-source offering from Microsoft for developing LLM-powered agents and multi-agent workflows.

## Overview

- **Microsoft Agent Framework** is an open-source AI development kit designed to help developers build agents and multi-agent orchestration workflows using **.NET** and **Python**.
- It unifies and extends the capabilities of its predecessors: **Semantic Kernel** (enterprise feature focus) and **AutoGen** (agent abstractions and multi-agent experimentation).

## Key Topics Covered

- **Framework Structure:** Breaks down how Microsoft Agent Framework is architected for modularity, including LLM integrations, tool use, and workflow orchestration.
- **Enterprise and Agent Features:** Inherits state management, type safety, telemetry, and broad model support from Semantic Kernel, while adding explicit graph-based workflows from AutoGen.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Supports graph workflows, checkpointing, and human-in-the-loop scenarios, suitable for complex enterprise applications.
- **Transition from Previous Frameworks:** Explains why Microsoft combined Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, creating a single, production-ready foundation for modern AI agent systems.
- **Real-world Use Cases:** Demonstrates how developers can build robust, long-running agent workflows with enhanced observability and control.

## Why Choose Agent Framework?

- Seamlessly integrates enterprise-grade features with flexible agent abstractions.
- Facilitates building scalable, maintainable AI agent systems for both experimentation and production scenarios.
- Supports cross-language development with **.NET** and **Python**.
