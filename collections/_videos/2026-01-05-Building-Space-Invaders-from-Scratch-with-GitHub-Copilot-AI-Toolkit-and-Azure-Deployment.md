# Building Space Invaders from Scratch with AI in Visual Studio Code

**Presented by:** David Roussett (@davrous), Reynald Adolphe (@ReynaldAdolphe)

## Overview

This video covers a complete journey of building a Space Invaders game from scratch using modern AI tooling and cloud technologies directly within Visual Studio Code. The workflow leverages the power of GitHub Copilot, MCP (Microsoft Copilot Platform), and features a range of development and deployment tools.

## Key Steps and Technologies

- **Game Creation with GitHub Copilot:**
  - Initiate Space Invaders project in VS Code
  - Use GitHub Copilot to assist and accelerate coding

- **UX & Design with Figma:**
  - Prototype and control game UX flow

- **AI Integration:**
  - Use AI Toolkit to connect to large language models (LLM)

- **Automated Review:**
  - Implement Playwright to enable AI-powered automated self-review of the codebase

- **Leaderboard Implementation:**
  - Integrate Spec Kit for a robust leaderboard feature

- **Cloud Deployment:**
  - Deploy the finished game to Azure using Azure MCP
  - Utilize Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI for streamlined deployment
