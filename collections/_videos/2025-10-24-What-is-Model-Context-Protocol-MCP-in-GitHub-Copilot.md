# What is Model Context Protocol (MCP) in GitHub Copilot?

**Presenter:** Reynald Adolphe (@ReynaldAdolphe)

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to extend the capabilities of AI models like GitHub Copilot by allowing them to access and interact with external tools and data within the development environment. This protocol facilitates richer context for code suggestions, increasing the utility and accuracy of Copilot-powered workflows.

## Key Features

- **External Tool Integration:** MCP enables Copilot to connect to external data sources, APIs, or local development tools, giving AI models access to more contextual information.
- **Enhanced Code Suggestions:** By leveraging external context, Copilot improves its code completion and suggestions, making them more relevant and actionable for complex scenarios.
- **Security and Permissions:** The protocol ensures secure connections between Copilot and authorized external sources, respecting developer workflows and privacy.

## Developer Benefits

- **Improved Productivity:** With enhanced context from MCP integrations, developers spend less time switching between tools to retrieve relevant data.
- **Scalable Workflows:** MCP allows extensible integration, so teams can tailor Copilot behavior to their unique environments and toolchains.
