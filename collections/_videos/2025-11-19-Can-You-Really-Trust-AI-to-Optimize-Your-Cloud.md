# Can You Really Trust AI to Optimize Your Cloud?

**Speaker:** Suresh Mathew, CEO of Sedai
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025
**Session:** ODSP1433

## Overview

Operating hundreds of services in an enterprise cloud is costly and labor-intensive. Many engineering leaders are adopting AI-powered solutions to manage tasks such as resource rightsizing and resolving availability issues. This session examines whether it's truly safe to rely on AI for cloud optimization and the consequences when failures occur.

## Key Topics

- **The Case for AI in Cloud Optimization**
    - Examines why AI-guided automation is increasingly seen as the safest and most efficient method for optimizing cloud operations.
- **Definition of Autonomous Systems**
    - Clarifies what intelligent automation entails in large-scale environments.
- **Accuracy Challenges**
    - Highlights common causes of automation errors, including erroneous metrics and missing data spikes.
- **AI’s Role in Reliability**
    - Details how AI strengthens automation reliability.
- **Protecting Engineers and Improving Productivity**
    - Discusses how AI can safeguard engineering resources and free up time for critical work.
- **AI ‘Autopilot’ Capabilities**
    - Explores fully autonomous execution, removing the need for manual intervention.
- **Unified Command Center**
    - Reviews the concept of an AI-driven, consolidated dashboard for cloud optimization and oversight.

## Benefits and Risks

- **Benefits**
    - Cost savings through automated rightsizing
    - Enhanced availability management
    - Unified control and visibility of services
    - Reduced manual workload for operations teams
- **Risks**
    - Reliability issues stemming from inaccurate data or misconfigured metrics
    - Potential operational failures if AI automation is not properly managed

## Conclusion

AI is increasingly central to cloud management within enterprise environments. Architectural teams must carefully balance the productivity gains and automation benefits against the risks and reliability challenges posed by full reliance on intelligent systems.
