# Building an App in VS Code with AI Agents – Cozy AI Kitchen

**Host:** John Maeda, VP of Design and AI, Microsoft  
**Guest:** Elijah King, Product Designer, VS Code Team

## Overview

This session explores the future of app creation where natural language and AI agents enable anyone—including non-developers and designers—to build fully-working iOS chatbot applications directly within Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Elijah King demonstrates the entire process, emphasizing the accessibility and power of AI-driven developer tools.

## Key Learning Points

- **Natural Language to Code:** How VS Code Background Agents translate prompts into executable code
- **AI Model Switching:** Using Haiku 4.5, Codex, and Gemini Pro 3 to balance speed, accuracy, and creativity in app development
- **Rapid App Bootstrapping:** Creating the foundation of an iOS app with a single prompt
- **Multi-Agent Workflows:** Utilizing parallel AI agents to add features such as UI, settings menus, theme toggles, and secure API key storage
- **Empowering Designers:** Encouragement and demonstration of how non-coders can become design engineers
