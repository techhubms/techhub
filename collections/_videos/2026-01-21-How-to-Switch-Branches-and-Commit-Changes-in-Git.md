# How to Switch Branches and Commit Changes in Git

In this video, the GitHub team demonstrates essential git branch management skills:

- **Switching Branches**: Learn how to use `git switch` to move between branches, including returning to your main branch and working with feature branches for isolated development.
- **Editing Files**: Make edits in your chosen branch.
- **Status Checks**: Use `git status` to see changes that need to be staged or committed.
- **Staging Changes**: Stage files with `git add` so they're ready to be committed.
- **Committing Updates**: Save your work with `git commit` and include a message describing your changes.

## Full Git Workflow Demonstrated

1. **Switch Back and Forth Between Branches**
   - `git switch main`
   - `git switch your-feature-branch`
2. **Edit Files**
   - Make the code or documentation changes you need.
3. **Check the Working Directory**
   - `git status` shows which files have changed and which are staged for commit.
4. **Stage Your Changes**
   - `git add <filename>` stages your changes for the next commit.
5. **Commit Your Work**
   - `git commit -m 'Describe your changes'` records your edits in git history.

This tutorial is ideal for new developers starting with git and GitHub, illustrating a smooth workflow for making and recording changes in a project repository.
