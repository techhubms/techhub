# From DEV to PROD: Building Agentic Memory with Azure Cosmos DB

## Session Overview

This Microsoft Ignite 2025 breakout (BRK135) delivers an advanced look at architecting agentic memory for generative AI applications using Azure Cosmos DB. The session targets developers and architects seeking to unify data platforms and leverage advanced AI features securely in production environments.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Latest AI and Search Features in Cosmos DB**: Announcements and practical walkthroughs of new capabilities to enhance AI-driven apps.
- **Agentic Memory Architecture**: Explanation of both short-term and long-term memory paradigms in agentic applications, including design requirements and strategies for each.
- **Efficient Retrieval with Summarization and Semantic Search**: Techniques to utilize summarization for storing long-term memory, and leveraging semantic hybrid queries within Cosmos DB for efficient AI data retrieval.
- **Query Patterns**:
  - SQL-like queries
  - Semantic queries
  - Hybrid approaches for flexible data access
- **Latency and Architectural Considerations**: Discussion of potential latency pitfalls, especially in on-premise environments, and functional requirements to address them.
- **Compliance, Security, and Governance**: Best practices to prevent data oversharing, manage sprawl, safeguard AI workloads from threats, and ensure regulatory compliance and responsible data governance throughout the application lifecycle.
- **Real-World Implementation**: Case study featuring Walmart Chile on customer-centric AI strategies leveraging these capabilities.
