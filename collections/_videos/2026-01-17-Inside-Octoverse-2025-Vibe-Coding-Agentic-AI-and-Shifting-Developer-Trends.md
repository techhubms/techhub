# Inside Octoverse 2025: Vibe Coding, Agentic AI, and Shifting Developer Trends

**Podcast Hosts:** Andrea, Kedasha, Abigail Cabunoc Mayes, Cassidy Williams  
**Special Guest:** Jeff Luszcz (GitHub, Octoverse data lead)

## Episode Highlights

- **TypeScript Surpasses Python:** Analysis of why TypeScript has overtaken Python in GitHub projects, reflecting changing industry usage.
- **The New Era of Vibe Coding and Agentic AI:** Overview of how AI-assisted development, including GitHub Copilot, is transforming engineering workflows. Discussion on 'vibe coding'—developers leveraging AI not just to generate code, but to ideate, refactor, and shape development direction.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Insight into new ways developers interact with AI agents to handle routine tasks and code suggestions.
- **Open Source at Scale:** Over 1.12 billion open source contributions and more than 518 million pull requests merged, evidence of rapidly growing engagement, especially in regions like India, Brazil, and Indonesia.
- **COBOL Makes a Comeback:** Surprising resurgence in COBOL, showing the continuity and reinvention of legacy programming skills in the modern era.
- **Security By Default:** How tools like CodeQL and Dependabot are shifting the industry toward built-in security practices, and how secret scanning enhances code safety.
- **Future Skills for Developers:** The report details in-demand skills for the AI era, emphasizing lifelong learning, global collaboration, and security consciousness.

## Key Takeaways

- **AI and Copilot Integration:** GitHub Copilot is now influencing how developers approach daily coding, affecting productivity and team processes.
- **Security Tools:** Built-in tools like CodeQL and Dependabot reduce vulnerabilities and make secure development workflows more attainable.
- **Growth in Developer Community:** With over 180 million developers on GitHub and one new developer joining every second, collaboration and knowledge sharing are more vital than ever.
- **Regional Insights:** Notable increases in contributions from emerging technology regions reflect globalization in open-source ecosystems.
