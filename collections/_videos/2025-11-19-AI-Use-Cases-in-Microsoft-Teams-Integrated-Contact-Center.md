# AI Use Cases in Microsoft Teams Integrated Contact Center

## Overview

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 explores the application of AI within Teams-integrated contact centers, demonstrating four practical use cases designed to improve both customer and agent experiences.

### Main Use Cases and Demos

- **Digital Assistant IVR**: AI-driven Interactive Voice Response (IVR) streamlines call routing and handles customer inquiries, seamlessly escalating to human agents when AI cannot provide answers.
- **AI Transfer Assistant**: Assists agents in handling complex customer transfers by suggesting optimal hand-off options and providing context.
- **Suggested Resources Based on Call Context**: AI analyzes live conversation data to suggest relevant resources and knowledge articles in real-time, enhancing first-contact resolution rates.
- **AI Agent Checklist**: Provides agents with step-by-step checklists and recommended actions, supporting both new and experienced agents for consistent service quality.

### Scenarios Discussed

- **Multi-layer AI Customer Interaction**: Combines IVR, FAQ models, and business system integration to provide holistic support throughout the customer journey.
- **Agent Empowerment**: AI tools help new agents quickly ramp up, perform at high levels, and ensure scalable performance tracking and improvement.
- **Supervisor & Manager Enablement**: AI features extend to supervisors for agent coaching and to managers for insight-driven decision making.

### Microsoft Power Platform Integration

- Power Platform is used for generating insights, automated summaries, and further enhancing agent workflows and reporting.

### Chapters

- Failover to human agents when AI lacks answers
- Three layers of AI interaction: IVR routing, FAQ model, and business system integration
- Transitioning to agent assist for empowered customer service
- Live demo: AI support for trial setup calls
- Scalable agent performance tracking
- Supervisor and manager functionalities
- Integration with Power Platform

## Conclusion

AI-driven features are increasingly central to delivering efficient, scalable, and responsive contact center experiences in Microsoft Teams. By supporting agents with intelligent tools and actionable insights, organizations can achieve consistent service quality and better customer outcomes.
