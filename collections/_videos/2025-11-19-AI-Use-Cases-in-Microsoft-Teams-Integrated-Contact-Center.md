# AI Use Cases in Microsoft Teams Integrated Contact Center

## Overview

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 explores the application of AI within Teams-integrated contact centers, demonstrating four practical use cases designed to improve both customer and agent experiences.

### Main Use Cases and Demos

- **Digital Assistant IVR**: AI-driven Interactive Voice Response (IVR) streamlines call routing and handles customer inquiries, seamlessly escalating to human agents when AI cannot provide answers.
- **AI Transfer Assistant**: Assists agents in handling complex customer transfers by suggesting optimal hand-off options and providing context.
- **Suggested Resources Based on Call Context**: AI analyzes live conversation data to suggest relevant resources and knowledge articles in real-time, enhancing first-contact resolution rates.
- **AI Agent Checklist**: Provides agents with step-by-step checklists and recommended actions, supporting both new and experienced agents for consistent service quality.

### Scenarios Discussed

- **Multi-layer AI Customer Interaction**: Combines IVR, FAQ models, and business system integration to provide holistic support throughout the customer journey.
- **Agent Empowerment**: AI tools help new agents quickly ramp up, perform at high levels, and ensure scalable performance tracking and improvement.
- **Supervisor & Manager Enablement**: AI features extend to supervisors for agent coaching and to managers for insight-driven decision making.

### Microsoft Power Platform Integration

- Power Platform is used for generating insights, automated summaries, and further enhancing agent workflows and reporting.

### Chapters

- Failover to human agents when AI lacks answers
- Three layers of AI interaction: IVR routing, FAQ model, and business system integration
