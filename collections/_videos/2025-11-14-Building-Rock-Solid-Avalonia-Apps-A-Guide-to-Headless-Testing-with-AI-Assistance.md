# Building Rock-Solid Avalonia Apps: A Guide to Headless Testing with AI Assistance

Application quality is essential for modern development, but UI testing often becomes a bottleneck. In this session, dotnet walks through creating a robust, professional testing strategy for Avalonia applications using headless testing.

## What You'll Learn

- **Headless Testing with Avalonia:** Execute complex UI interaction tests at high speed without a display server, making your test suite faster and more stable.
- **Practical Testing Techniques:** Deep dive into professional practices for testing Avalonia apps to ensure maintainability and quality.
- **AI-Driven Test Development:** See live demonstrations of GitHub Copilot assisting as an AI pair programmer, helping you:
  - Write test code faster
  - Tackle tricky edge cases
  - Maintain and evolve your test suite with increased developer productivity

## Key Takeaways

- **Enhanced Testing Workflow:** Learn to streamline your testing process and overcome traditional UI testing challenges.
- **Integrating AI Tools:** Discover how to leverage GitHub Copilot in real-world scenarios for .NET projects and Avalonia apps.
