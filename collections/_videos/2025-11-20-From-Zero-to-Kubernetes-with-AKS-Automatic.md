# From Zero to Kubernetes with AKS Automatic

## Session Overview

Kubernetes offers robust features for running modern applications, but operational complexity can hinder adoption. In this Ignite 2025 session, Amanda Wang and Paul Yu introduce **AKS Automatic**, designed to make Kubernetes more accessible and production-ready for developers and operations teams.

## Key Topics

- **Kubernetes Complexity:** Discussion about common challenges organizations face when managing Kubernetes at scale and the associated operational overhead.

- **Introducing AKS Automatic:**
  - Streamlines cluster setup and management
  - Automates provisioning, scaling, and infrastructure operations
  - Embeds Microsoft-recommended security, scalability, and performance best practices for out-of-the-box production clusters

- **Automated Deployment and Service Configuration:**
  - Walkthrough demonstrating quick automated cluster deployments
  - Configuring services with minimal manual intervention

- **Node Auto Provisioning with Karpenter:**
  - Explanation and demonstration of how Karpenter automates node provisioning
  - Features such as intelligent bin packing and dynamic scaling to optimize resource allocation and performance

- **Observability and Monitoring:**
  - Integration with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics
  - OpenTelemetry support for robust monitoring and telemetry collection
  - How observability tools help operators maintain reliable, scalable, and secure Kubernetes environments

## Summary

AKS Automatic delivers a fast, secure, and straightforward Kubernetes experience on Azure. By automating operations and embedding best practices, organizations can focus on innovating with cloud-native apps without worrying about underlying infrastructure complexity.
