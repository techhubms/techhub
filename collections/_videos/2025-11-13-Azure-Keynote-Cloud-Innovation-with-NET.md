# Azure Keynote: Cloud Innovation with .NET

Presented by Scott Hunter and Paul Yuknewicz, this session demonstrates how Azure is shaping the future of cloud-native development for .NET professionals.

## Latest Innovations for .NET Developers on Azure

- **Azure Container Apps:** Streamline deployment and management of container-based .NET applications.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** Orchestrate and scale .NET solutions using Kubernetes on Azure, with built-in observability and security features.
- **Azure Functions:** Accelerate event-driven and serverless architecture adoption with seamless .NET integration.
- **Azure AI Services:** Power intelligent applications through Azure's robust AI platform capabilities.

## Advances in the .NET Ecosystem

- **.NET 10:** Unification and intelligence for modern developer workflows.
- **.NET Aspire 13:** Simplify orchestration for cloud-native apps (see [announcement](https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement)).
- **ASP.NET Core 10:** Modern, secure full-stack web dev (see [docs](https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025)).
- **.NET MAUI 10:** Build cross-platform apps with enhanced UI performance ([info](https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025)).
- **C# 14 and F# 10:** Language improvements for greater productivity and safety ([C# 14](https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025), [F# 10](https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement)).
- **Visual Studio 2026:** Enhanced developer experience ([see announcement](https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement)).
