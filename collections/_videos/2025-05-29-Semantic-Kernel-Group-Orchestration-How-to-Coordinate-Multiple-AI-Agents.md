# Semantic Kernel Group Orchestration: How to Coordinate Multiple AI Agents

Learn Microsoft AI guides you through the process of multi-agent orchestration in Microsoft's Semantic Kernel, focusing on collaborative AI problem-solving.

## What You'll Learn

- **Overview of Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Understanding how Semantic Kernel enables AI agents to work together instead of relying on a single agent.
- **Group Chat Orchestration Explained**: Insights into 'group chat orchestration', where a group chat manager controls agent responses and sequencing.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world examples including meetings, debates, and team-based problem-solving where multi-agent orchestration shines.

## Demo Walkthrough

- **Visual Studio Demo Setup**: Step-by-step explanation of the demo environment used to showcase orchestration concepts.
- **Implementing Group Orchestration**: Practical guidance on setting up Semantic Kernel to manage multiple agents in sequence and as a group.
- **Interactive Callback**: How to use callbacks to manage real-time AI agent interactions.
- **Custom Round-Robin Manager**: Creating and demonstrating a custom manager to control agent turns and orchestrate collaboration.
