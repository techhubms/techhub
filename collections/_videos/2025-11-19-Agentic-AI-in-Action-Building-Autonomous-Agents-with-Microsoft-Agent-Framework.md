# Agentic AI in Action: Building Autonomous Agents with Microsoft Agent Framework

## Session Overview

This Microsoft Ignite 2025 session focuses on moving enterprises from simple automation to true AI autonomy. The speakers, Pavel Nasovich and Dmitry Tikhomirov, demonstrate the use of Microsoft's Agent Framework for orchestrating complex business processes, specifically in Know Your Customer (KYC) scenarios.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Technical deep dive into agentic AI for KYC workflows, demonstrating the orchestration of specialized agents (e.g., risk assessment, case manager).
- **Compliance & Traceability:** Secure document management is ensured through role-based access controls in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
- **Workflow Flexibility:** Explains the use of MOV (Modular Orchestration Visualization) and YAML-based systems enabling rapid agentic workflow development and evolution.
- **Integration:** Seamless connection with Copilot Studio and Azure AI for fast deployment of production-ready autonomous workflows.
- **Experimental Networks:** Discussion on experimental, self-evolving agent networks and operational challenges during MVP implementation.

## Demonstration Highlights

- Creation of agents using Microsoft Agent Framework
- Risk assessment agent for client evaluation
- Case manager agent for case summation and decision making
- Inter-agent communication and workflow orchestration
- Secure role-based document access with compliance tracking
- Challenges faced in moving from MVP to scalable solution
