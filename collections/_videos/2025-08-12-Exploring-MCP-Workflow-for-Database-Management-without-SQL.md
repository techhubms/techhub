# Exploring MCP Workflow for Database Management without SQL

This video by Microsoft Developer delves into how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflow provides an alternative to traditional SQL-based database management.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to MCP**: Understand the basics of the Model Context Protocol and how it functions as a foundation for database management workflows.
- **MCP in Visual Studio Code**: Learn about the integration of MCP servers and developer tools directly within VS Code, making modern workflows more accessible.
- **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service**: Discover how to integrate MCP tools into custom agents using the Foundry Agent Service ([read more](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/announcing-model-context-protocol-support-preview-in-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service/)).
- **Community Resources**: Engage with the developer community through Discord ([join](https://aka.ms/azureaifoundry/discord)) and keep up with new features in VS Code via monthly release parties ([info](https://aka.ms/VSCode/Live)).

## Benefits of MCP Workflow

- Modernizes database management by moving beyond SQL syntax.
- Offers seamless integration with cloud services (Azure) and developer tools (VS Code).
- Enables enhanced productivity for developers working with database-driven applications.
- Facilitates the building of custom AI-powered agents for specialized workflows.

## Getting Started

- Visit the [MCP for beginners curriculum](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners) to get started.
- Explore how MCP can be set up within VS Code and integrated into your workflow.
- Review the Foundry Agent Service documentation for leveraging MCP with custom agent development.
