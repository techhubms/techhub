# Agent Skills (Skills.md) in GitHub Copilot for Visual Studio Code

Agent Skills, formalized in the `Skills.md` format, let developers define collections of instructions, scripts, and resources that extend the capabilities of AI agents, including GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code. This video explains how these skills help Copilot perform specialized tasks tailored to developer needs.

## What are Agent Skills?

- **Agent Skills**: Folders containing `Skills.md` files and supporting resources
- **Purpose**: Enable AI agents to access, interpret, and execute custom instructions
- **Standard**: Works across multiple tools, including GitHub Copilot (VS Code, CLI, Coding agent)

## How Agent Skills Work in VS Code

- Create a folder structure containing instructions/scripts relevant for repetitive or specialized workflows
- Copilot loads and uses these instructions to inform its completions and suggestions
- Developers can efficiently tailor Copilot's suggestions to fit project or organization-specific best practices

## Interoperability

- The Agent Skills open standard enables reusing the same skills with:
  - GitHub Copilot in VS Code  
  - GitHub Copilot CLI  
  - Copilot Coding Agent

## Getting Started

- Documentation: [Agent Skills in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills)
- More info: [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)

## Featured Speakers

- James Montemagno
- Harald Kirschner
- Tim Rogers

## Why Use Agent Skills?

- Extend Copilot and integrate team or personal workflows
- Standardize task automation within AI-driven development environments
- Share skills between environments and agents
