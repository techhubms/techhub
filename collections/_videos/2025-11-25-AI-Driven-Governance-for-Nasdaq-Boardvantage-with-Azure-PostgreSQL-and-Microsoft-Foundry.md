# AI-Driven Governance for Nasdaq Boardvantage with Azure PostgreSQL and Microsoft Foundry

**Speaker(s): Charles Feddersen, Mohsin Shafqat**

## Overview

Nasdaq Boardvantage, trusted by nearly half of Fortune 100 companies, is architected for secure, intelligent board operations. This session details how open-source databases on Azure and Microsoft Foundry enable scalable, resilient, and advanced AI capabilities to support regulated enterprises.

## Key Topics

- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL & MySQL**: Backbone for secure data management and integration.
- **Microsoft Foundry and Azure AI Foundry**: Empower agentic AI operations including smart document summarization and automated meeting minutes.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Supports orchestrating microservices and scaling AI solutions efficiently.
- **API Management**: Enables robust integration and security across applications.

## AI-Powered Features

- **Smart Document Summarization**: Leverages AI models deployed through Foundry to extract and summarize information from complex board materials.
- **Automated Meeting Minutes**: AI matches agenda sections to relevant data, facilitating the generation of compliant, informative minutes.
- **Hybrid Search with PG Vector**: Enables efficient document retrieval and search functionality in PostgreSQL.

## Technical Architecture Highlights

- **Fan-In Fan-Out Orchestration**: Addresses challenges in microservices management by combining multiple inputs and distributing outputs efficiently; implemented with Azure Functions.
- **Chat Assistant Architecture**: Integrates Azure Functions, vector databases, and agentic AI for interactive features.
- **Prompt Flow for AI Stability**: Tackles determinism and hallucination in AI output using Azure AI Foundry's Prompt Flow tooling.

## Compliance & Security

- Deep discussion of regulatory compliance, data privacy, and confidential information handling with Azure's native controls and open-source flexibility.
