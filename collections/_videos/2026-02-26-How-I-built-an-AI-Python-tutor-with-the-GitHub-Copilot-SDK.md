# How I Built an AI Python Tutor with the GitHub Copilot SDK

In this video, April explores the challenge of helping her Python livestream students who get stuck on practice exercises after the sessions end. To remedy this, she developed a dedicated learning platform featuring a custom AI tutor.

## Key Elements

- **Problem**: Students struggled with Python practice exercises after livestream tutorials.
- **Solution**: Build a platform with a built-in AI Python tutor to provide helpful hints.

## Implementing the AI Tutor

- **Tech Stack**: Utilizes the [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk) to power the AI assistant.
- **Functionality**: The tutor is designed to respond to student code submissions with incremental hints, fostering independent problem solving while preventing direct answer giveaways.

## Video Highlights

- **Demo**: April demonstrates the learning platform.
- **Build Process**: Step-by-step creation of the Python tutor using the Copilot SDK.
- **Integration**: Shows the process of embedding the tutor into the platform.
- **Testing**: Validating the integration and demonstrating tutor responses.
