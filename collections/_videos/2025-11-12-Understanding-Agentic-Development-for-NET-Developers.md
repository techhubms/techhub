# Understanding Agentic Development for .NET Developers

Agentic development is a new direction in AI, emphasizing systems that can autonomously reason, plan, and execute actions to accomplish complex objectives. This session introduces .NET developers to the concepts and patterns behind agentic AI, moving beyond basic prompt/response models to intelligent agents capable of collaborating, making decisions, and taking meaningful actions on users’ behalf.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Agentic AI Principles**: How agent architectures support reasoning, planning, and action.
- **Building AI Agents in .NET**:
  - Leveraging frameworks and patterns tailored to the .NET ecosystem.
  - Practical approaches to function execution and tool calling.
  - Designing agents that decompose large tasks, make decisions, and collaborate.
- **.NET Tools and Updates**:
  - [Learn about .NET 10](https://aka.ms/dotnet10/): Unified, intelligent development platform
  - [Explore .NET Aspire 13](https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement): Simplified orchestration for cloud-native agentic apps
  - [Discover ASP.NET Core 10](https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025): Modern, secure, and full-stack web dev
  - [Cross-platform with .NET MAUI 10](https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025)
  - [C# 14](https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025), [F# 10](https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement): More expressive and powerful AI-friendly languages
  - [Visual Studio 2026](https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement): Optimized for AI development
- **Collaboration & Community**
  - [Official .NET blog](https://aka.ms/dotnet/blog) and [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/learndotnet) for ongoing education.
  - Participate in the [.NET Conf 2025](https://aka.ms/dotnotconf2025/recap) to stay updated on agentic AI advancements.

## Why Agentic AI Matters

Agentic systems enable applications to:

- Break down complex workflows into actionable plans
- Execute multi-step reasoning and function calls
- Coordinate with other agents for collaborative outcomes
- Provide users with intelligent, proactive solutions

## Takeaways for Developers

- Understand agentic AI design and how it integrates into modern .NET apps
- Learn which frameworks and tools accelerate agentic AI development
- Get practical pointers to official docs and community resources for further learning
