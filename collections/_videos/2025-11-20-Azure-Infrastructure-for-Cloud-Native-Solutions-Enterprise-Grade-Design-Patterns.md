# Azure Infrastructure for Cloud Native Solutions: Enterprise-Grade Design Patterns

## Defining Cloud Native Applications

Cloud-native applications are architected for resilience, scalability, and rapid deployment. This session begins by outlining key characteristics, such as stateless workloads, distributed systems, and service-oriented patterns.

## Azure Scale with Databricks

Aaron Davidson from Databricks discusses how Databricks leverages Azure's infrastructure for large-scale processing, sharing insights into:

- Massive scaling requirements
- Integration with Azure VMSS (Virtual Machine Scale Sets)
- Use of Azure Storage for performance and reliability

## VMSS Delete Instances API & Atomic Scaling

Learn about the VMSS Delete Instances API and atomic scaling techniques:

- VMSS enables scaling of stateless workloads in response to demand
- Atomic scaling ensures consistency and minimizes downtime during scaling operations

## VM Lifecycle Management & Sharding

Field-tested guidance covers:

- Managing VM lifecycles efficiently
- Adopting sharding strategies for distributed performance
- Optimizing resource utilization in multi-tenant environments

## Zone-Aligned Architecture

Discover best practices for availability and predictability in cloud-native deployments:

- Using zone alignment to increase service resilience
- Reducing risk with multiple fault domains

## Breach Containment with Illumia

Illumia’s Breach Containment Platform demonstrates real Azure infrastructure use:

- Detection, aggregation, and scaling for threat containment
- High availability through redundancy and distributed failover
- Security integration leveraging Azure-native features

## Threat Intelligence & MITRE Framework Integration

Explore security-focused architecture:

- Correlating threat intelligence using Azure’s analytic capabilities
- Integrating the MITRE ATT&CK framework within Azure solutions
- Best practices for advanced threat detection and response
