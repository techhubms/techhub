# Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers: Building AI Integrations

**Presented by Microsoft Developer**

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is reshaping how AI systems access external data and tools. This video introduces the practical steps developers need to build MCP servers and create integrations that allow AI-powered assistants to interact with APIs, databases, and other services.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that enables AI assistants to securely access and interact with external resources using a standardized approach. With MCP, you can expose your application's APIs, services, or databases to any MCP-compatible AI system, improving interoperability and unlocking advanced automation scenarios.

## Session Highlights

- **Core Concepts**:
    - *Resources*: Defining what your app or service makes available to AI systems (APIs, data sources, actions).
    - *Tools*: Components that AI assistants use to connect with resources.
    - *Prompts*: Mechanisms for AI to discover and utilize resources effectively.
- **MCP Server Lifecycle**:
    1. Designing and defining resources with proper metadata
    2. Implementing endpoints to publish those resources
    3. Enabling discovery and secure access for AI assistants
- **Live Walkthrough**:
    - Building a simple MCP server using Visual Studio
    - Demonstrating server configuration for exposing APIs or databases
    - Overview of testing and validating MCP integrations

## Why Use MCP?

- **Cross-platform AI integration**: Works with any MCP-compatible system
- **Enables AI-powered workflows**: Connects AI assistants directly to business logic, APIs, and data
- **Open standard**: Promotes interoperability between AI vendors and applications

## Get Started

- Download [Visual Studio](http://visualstudio.com) for development
- Explore additional sessions at [VS Live](https://aka.ms/vslivehq25)
- MCP documentation and best practices (recommend checking Microsoft’s official resources as content is updated frequently)

## Who Should Watch?

This session is ideal for developers new to MCP who want a practical, fast-track introduction to enabling AI application integrations.
