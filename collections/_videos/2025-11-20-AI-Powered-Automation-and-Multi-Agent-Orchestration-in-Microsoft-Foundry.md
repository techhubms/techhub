# AI-Powered Automation and Multi-Agent Orchestration in Microsoft Foundry

**Presented by:** Christof Gebhart, Shawn Henry, Tina Manghnani, Mark Wallace  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025, Session BRK197  

## Overview

This session explores the journey from single-agent prototypes to orchestrated, policy-governed multi-agent systems using Microsoft Foundry. Attendees will learn best practices and advanced strategies for architecting, deploying, and managing AI agents at scale with strong focus on governance, monitoring, and human-in-the-loop design.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Foundry Agent Framework (Semantic Kernel + AutoGen):**
  - Framework for rapidly building and managing AI agents with robust orchestration capabilities
  - Leverages existing AI development tools such as Semantic Kernel and AutoGen
- **Fleet-Level Orchestration:**
  - Techniques for scaling agent deployments and coordinating multiple agents in an ecosystem
  - Integrating shared state and agent-to-agent (A2A) activity protocols
- **Human-in-the-Loop Automation:**
  - Incorporating manual decision steps and validations in automated workflows
- **Cross-Framework Compatibility:**
  - Integrating external agent frameworks like LangGraph and OpenAI Agents SDK for greater flexibility
- **Containerized, Governed, Observable Agents:**
  - Deploying agents as containers for scalability and manageability
  - Utilizing OpenTelemetry (OpenTel) for observability and monitoring of agent activity
- **Security and Governance with Microsoft Purview:**
  - Integration with Microsoft Purview enabling policy enforcement and data governance
  - Demonstration of Purview policy middleware for secure agent workflows
  - Techniques for detecting and handling sensitive data (e.g., credit cards, SSNs)
- **Development Tooling and Migration:**
  - GitHub Copilot extensions for agent code migration and development boosts within Visual Studio
  - MCP toolchains for managing complex multi-agent environments
- **Practical Demonstrations:**
  - Setting up AZD Templates and Environment for Foundry-based projects
  - Real-world examples including BMW's multi-agent ecosystem

## Session Structure

- **Introduction:** Framing AI-powered automation and multi-agent trends
- **Impact Case:** BMW’s large-scale deployment
- **Lessons Learned:** Insights from Microsoft and its partners, frequent development challenges
- **Workflow Deep Dive:** Integrating Foundry’s agent orchestration with shared state and framework plug-ins
- **Security & Governance:** Data protection with Purview middleware and real-time sensitive data analysis
- **Tools Walkthrough:** Using Copilot extensions, Visual Studio tools, and AZD for rapid adoption
