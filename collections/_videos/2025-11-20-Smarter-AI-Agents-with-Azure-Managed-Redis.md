# Smarter AI Agents with Azure Managed Redis

## Session Overview

At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Simon Brown, Shruti Pathak, Georgios Theologou, and Mark Weitzel presented how to elevate AI agent systems by leveraging Azure Managed Redis, Mem0, and Agent Framework.

This session illustrates how combining these technologies enables:

- **Real-time agent collaboration and semantic routing** with Azure Managed Redis
- **Persistent, cross-session memory** using Mem0
- **Agent orchestration, reasoning, and planning** with Agent Framework

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Azure Managed Redis Overview

- Simplifies real-time data sharing between AI agents
- Supports fast cache access for collaborative tasks
- Features updates including SKU retirement details

### 2. Enhancing AI Agents with Persistent Memory

- **Mem0**: Maintains knowledge and context between sessions
- Example: User preferences are stored across multiple agent interactions

### 3. Orchestrating Multi-Agent Systems

- **Agent Framework**: Empowers agents with tools for advanced reasoning and planning
- Supports domain-agnostic solutions and scalable team orchestration

### 4. Demos and Scenarios

- **Cache hit/miss demonstrations** highlight Redis performance benefits
- **Travel assistant scenario**: Updating prompts and user preferences in Redis
- **Multi-tool responses**: Agents generate rich, context-aware outputs

## How These Technologies Work Together

- **Redis**: Handles fast, shared data for agent communication
- **Mem0**: Provides long-term knowledge retention
- **Agent Framework**: Supplies planning and orchestration for collaborative solutions
- Together, these enable multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex, domain-spanning challenges
