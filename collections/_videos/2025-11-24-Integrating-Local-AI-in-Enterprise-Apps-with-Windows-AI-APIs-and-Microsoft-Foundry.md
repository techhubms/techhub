# Integrating Local AI in Enterprise Apps with Windows AI APIs and Microsoft Foundry

Presented at Microsoft Ignite 2025 by Connor Al-Joundi and Ivan Razumenic

## Overview

This advanced session walks developers through enabling local AI solutions on Copilot+ PCs using Windows AI APIs and Microsoft Foundry. The approach eliminates the need for cloud hosting and deep ML expertise.

### Key Capabilities

- **Built-in Models (Phi Silica)**: Integrate native language and vision models for summarization, rewriting, and image understanding directly on Copilot+ hardware.
- **Turnkey AI Features**: Activate features with minimal code, expediting AI-powered user experiences in enterprise applications.
- **Customization via LoRA**: Use Low Rank Adapter (LoRA) techniques to fine-tune AI models with proprietary enterprise data, improving application relevance and accuracy.
- **App Content Search**: Enhance applications with contextual search using AI to index and query app content.

## Demonstration Highlights

- **Remote Manufacturing Challenge**: Scenario-based demo illustrating real-world application and AI problem-solving.
- **RAG in Action (Root Cause Analysis)**: Demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Generation to improve actionable insights and output structuring.
- **LoRA Adapter Workflow**: Step-by-step guide on loading and linking LoRA adapters during inference for custom intelligence.
- **Customer-Specific Instructions**: Shows how to teach device-specific build instructions using RAG methods tailored to enterprise requirements.
- **Performance & Administrative Controls**: Covers enhancements to the Phi Silica model and enterprise-grade controls for managing and auditing Windows AI APIs.
