# Building Cross-Platform .NET Apps with Uno Platform & Contextual AI

## Overview

In this community standup, Bruno Capuano, Sam Basu, and Jérôme Laban discuss how Uno Platform enables developers to build cross-platform .NET applications across iOS, Android, web (WebAssembly), Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded devices.

## Uno Platform Highlights

- **Open-Source & Enterprise Grade:** Uno Platform is positioned as an open-source solution providing robust developer tooling for cross-platform needs.
- **Uno Platform Studio:** Enhances developer productivity with features like Hot Design—a runtime visual designer paired with Hot Reload—enabling rapid design and code iteration.
- **Figma Plugin Integration:** Eases design-to-code workflows, bridging UI/UX design and implementation to streamline the developer inner loop.

## AI Integration with Uno Platform

- **Contextual AI:** The latest Uno Platform release introduces grounded MCP Servers and custom AI Agents.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Control:** Developers can harness context-aware AI to interact with running apps, design, build, and iterate across any IDE or agentic workflow.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience:** AI can see and interact with live applications, making development more responsive and feedback-driven.
