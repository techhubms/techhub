# GitHub Issues Now Uses Semantic Search

GitHub has launched an improved semantic search capability for Issues, now available in public preview. This new feature leverages advances in natural language processing to better understand the intent behind developers' search queries. As a result, you no longer need to use exact keywords to find what you're looking for; the system interprets phrases and related terminology for more relevant results.

### Key Highlights

- **Semantic Understanding:** The search interprets natural language queries, making it easier to retrieve relevant issues.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Initial testing shows a 39% improvement over keyword-based search methods.
- **Developer Focused:** Aimed at making issue tracking and resolution more efficient for GitHub's developer community.

### Getting Started

- The feature is available in public preview for users on GitHub.com.
- Try searching in Issues using everyday language to experience improved results.

> _“Say goodbye to getting zero results just because you didn't use the exact keyword.”_
