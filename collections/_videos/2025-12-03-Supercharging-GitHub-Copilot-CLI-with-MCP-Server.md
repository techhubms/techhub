# Supercharging GitHub Copilot CLI with MCP Server

Discover how a kit-dev MCP Server can elevate GitHub Copilot CLI from basic terminal chat to a powerful development tool with features you can use every day:

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Instant Codebase Symbol Extraction**: Quickly find and navigate symbols in your codebase for faster understanding and editing.
- **Deep Package Documentation Research**: Easily access package-level documentation to improve development efficiency.
- **AST-Powered Code Search (Tree-sitter)**: Perform precise code searches using abstract syntax trees, making results far more accurate than regex-based search.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install GitHub Copilot CLI:**
   - [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://aka.ms/gh-copilot-cli)
2. **Setup the kit-dev MCP Server:**
   - [kit-dev MCP Server](https://kit-mcp.cased.com)

Follow the quick-start guides for both tools. The video walks through the integration steps and demonstrates real-world usage scenarios in Visual Studio Code.

## Practical Benefits

- Save time on repetitive development tasks
- Improve code navigation and understanding
- Access comprehensive documentation directly from the CLI
- Leverage advanced code search for deep codebase insights

If you are a developer using VS Code or GitHub Copilot CLI, these enhancements can make your daily workflow more efficient and productive.
