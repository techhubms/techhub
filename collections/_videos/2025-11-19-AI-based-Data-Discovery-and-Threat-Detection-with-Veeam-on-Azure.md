# AI-based Data Discovery and Threat Detection with Veeam on Azure

In this Microsoft Ignite 2025 session, Veeam Data Cloud for Microsoft 365 is presented as more than a backup solution. It harnesses the power of Azure and Azure AI to deliver:

- **High-throughput data discovery:** Quickly search and analyze large datasets stored on Microsoft 365, with actionable results for immediate recovery and investigation.
- **Advanced malware/ransomware detection:** Using Veeam’s patent-pending technology, threats are evaluated based on signals like entropy, suspicious file extensions, and blast radius analysis.
- **Natural language queries:** Security teams can interact with data using conversational AI tools, enabling fast and intuitive threat evaluation via the MCP server.
- **AI-driven management:** Automated threat triage and prioritization, empowering IT administrators, SOC leads, and CISOs to respond quickly and efficiently to incidents.
- **Integration with external sources:** Enriches threat context using various security feeds and web resources for more comprehensive insights.
- **Teams channel integration:** Supports incident coordination by creating Teams channels to streamline collaboration and posting malware analysis reports directly into Teams.
