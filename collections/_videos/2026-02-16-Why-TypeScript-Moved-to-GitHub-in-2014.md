# Why TypeScript Moved to GitHub in 2014

Anders Hejlsberg discusses the pivotal decision to transition TypeScript from CodePlex to GitHub in 2014. He highlights that simply publishing a project's source code does not guarantee growth or community engagement. Before the move, TypeScript received minimal attention—described as "crickets"—which changed dramatically after joining GitHub.

## Key Insights

- **Community Engagement:** The change to GitHub, where more developers congregate, significantly boosted visibility and contributions.
- **Process Change:** Microsoft started treating internal engineers as if they were external contributors, adopting a more transparent and inclusive development workflow.
- **Open Source Practices:** The adoption of best practices, such as open discussions and pull requests, intertwined internal and external contributions to improve TypeScript.

## Why This Matters

- Moving to a popular platform can fundamentally transform a project's growth and community input.
- Organizing projects with open governance and equal treatment for all contributors fosters rapid evolution.
