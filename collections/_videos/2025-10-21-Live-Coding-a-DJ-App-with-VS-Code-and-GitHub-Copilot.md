# Live-Coding a DJ App with VS Code and GitHub Copilot

**Presented by Julia Kasper**

In this engaging episode, Julia Kasper transforms Visual Studio Code (VS Code) into a creative music studio by building a browser-based live coding DJ application.

## Key Highlights

- **Introduction to Tone.js**: Understand the basics of Tone.js, a powerful framework for interactive music in the browser.
- **Building a DJ App from Scratch**:
    - Setting up VS Code for live music-coding sessions.
    - Writing and experimenting with code to create and layer beats, patterns, and effects.
    - Testing the web app and refining the music experience with real-time feedback.
- **GitHub Copilot in Action**:
    - Using Copilot's AI-powered code suggestions to generate music logic and rhythm structures quickly.
    - Leveraging prompt files within VS Code to experiment and customize Copilot's assistance for creative coding tasks.
- **Real-Time Creativity**:
    - Demonstrating live composition, remixing, and experimenting with techno sounds—all using code.
    - Tips for developers interested in coding generative music or integrating AI into their creative workflow.
