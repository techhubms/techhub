# Let's Learn Model Context Protocol (MCP) with JavaScript and TypeScript

**Presented by:** Debbie O'Brien, Chris Noring  
**Host:** Visual Studio Code

## Overview

This workshop introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a Microsoft-driven standard that helps developers connect AI models to client applications in a unified, open way. Beginners will learn core concepts, practical use cases, and how to create an MCP server.

## Chapters & Highlights

- **What is MCP?** (00:00)
  - Introduction to MCP: its purpose, architecture, and benefits for connecting clients and AI models.
- **Demo: Microsoft Docs MCP** (17:41)
  - Example of MCP in Microsoft Docs, demonstrating real-world functionality.
- **Demo: Playwright MCP** (22:05)
  - Illustration of integrating MCP with Playwright for interactive scenarios.
- **Demo: FileSystem MCP** (26:28)
  - Showcasing how MCP can interact with local file systems.
- **Live Coding: Create Your First MCP Server** (31:08)
  - Step-by-step guide on building and running an MCP server using JavaScript and TypeScript. Includes code samples and best practices.
