# What's New with GitHub Copilot Code Review: CodeQL, Agents & More

This GitHub video introduces key updates to Copilot's code review agent, seamlessly blending artificial intelligence with deterministic analysis. The agent leverages CodeQL, GitHub's industry-leading code analysis engine, to enhance accuracy and coverage in identifying code issues.

## Key Highlights

- **Session View:** Visualize code review sessions for pull requests, enabling clear feedback and actionable insights.
- **Actions Workflow:** Integrate code review activities directly into repository automation using GitHub Actions; review and automate with the Copilot agent inside the Actions tab.
- **CodeQL Integration:** Benefit from in-depth, automated code analysis. CodeQL scans repositories for vulnerabilities and design flaws, delivering reliable detection alongside Copilot's AI recommendations.
- **Results View:** Get detailed inspection feedback, resolving issues and incorporating improvements found by both AI and deterministic systems.
- **Coding Agent Handoff:** Developers can directly hand off unresolved comments and issues to the Copilot coding agent within pull requests, streamlining the review process and facilitating collaboration.

## Benefits for Developers

- Automate and optimize code reviews by combining AI insights with rule-based analysis.
- Save time identifying vulnerabilities and design issues with CodeQL.
- Enhance repository management and workflow integration using GitHub Actions.
- Collaborate efficiently by assigning tasks to Copilot agents within pull requests.
