# Integrating Copilot CLI with Visual Studio Code

This video demonstrates how the Copilot CLI brings powerful AI support straight to the developer's terminal in Visual Studio Code. Key operations include:

- **Connecting VS Code with Copilot CLI:**
  - Users set up the integration to gain Copilot's code suggestions directly in their terminal environment.
- **Session Tracking and Progress:**
  - Visual Studio Code allows you to monitor Copilot CLI sessions, review ongoing tasks, and see how Copilot is assisting within your coding workflow.
- **Smooth Workflow Transitions:**
  - Developers can easily switch between the terminal and the main editor without losing any session context, ensuring productivity whether coding in files or interacting with the shell.

These features let developers access AI completion, explanations, and context-aware support in whichever interface they're using, improving flexibility and efficiency. For more details and updates, refer to the following links:
