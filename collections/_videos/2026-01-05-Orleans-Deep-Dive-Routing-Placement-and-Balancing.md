# Orleans Deep Dive: Routing, Placement & Balancing

**Presented by:** dotnet team
**Featured Guests:** Reuben Bond, Ledjon Behluli, David Pine, Frank Boucher

## Overview

In this episode of On .NET Live, experts take a comprehensive look at Orleans, a framework for building scalable distributed applications in .NET. The discussion centers on how Orleans handles core concepts such as routing, grain placement, and load balancing within distributed systems.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Routing in Orleans:**
  - Examining how Orleans routes requests to the appropriate grains (virtual actors).
  - The role of identity-based routing in message delivery.
- **Placement Strategies:**
  - Overview of built-in and custom placement strategies for distributing grains across silos.
  - How placement affects fault tolerance, latency, and scalability in Orleans-based applications.
- **Load Balancing:**
  - Approaches Orleans uses to maintain even load distribution across the cluster.
  - Monitoring and adjusting load in real-time for large scale applications.

## Practical Insights

- Best practices for optimizing grain placement and system scalability
- Architectural considerations for distributed .NET applications
- Troubleshooting common issues in routing and balancing in Orleans

## About Orleans

Orleans is an open-source framework that simplifies building scalable and reliable distributed applications in .NET, utilizing the actor model with grains as key abstractions.
