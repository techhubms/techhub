# Scenes and Nodes - The Core Building Blocks in Godot with C# (Part 4 of 9)

In Episode 4 of our Godot C# training series, we explore the core principles and tools you need to start actual game development in Godot using C#.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Scenes and Nodes in Godot:** Learn how scenes and nodes compose the foundation of Godot projects.
- **Creating a Level Scene:** Step-by-step instructions to build your first level, add a ground plane, and implement collision detection.
- **Building a Reusable Player Character:** Use CharacterBody3D for a player character and integrate a third-person camera setup with SpringArm3D.
- **Node Hierarchy and Mesh Setup:** Organize your game objects, optimize for reuse, and work with 3D meshes.
- **Lighting:** Add directional lighting and adjust settings for visual fidelity.
- **Reusable Scenes:** Improve design efficiency using scene instancing so obstacles or items can be reused easily.

## Walkthrough

1. **Scenes and Nodes in Godot:** Understand why Godot uses scenes as the basic unit and nodes for building behavior.
2. **Creating the Level Scene:** Set up the project and create a simple level scene that will host all gameplay.
3. **Adding Ground and Collision:** Add a ground mesh with collision so the player character has a surface to move on.
4. **Player Character and Camera:** Build a CharacterBody3D player and attach a camera with SpringArm3D to follow player movement.
5. **Node Inheritance:** Learn how inheritance helps reuse scene logic and behavior.
6. **Lighting:** Create realistic lighting using DirectionalLight3D.
7. **Reusable Scene Instancing:** Demonstrate making obstacles as reusable scenes for rapid level building.

## Hands-On Challenge

- **Create a new Obstacle Scene:** Design an obstacle that blocks the player, and experiment with material and rendering settings.
