# The Origins & Evolution of the GitHub MCP Registry with Toby Padilla

In this episode, Toby Padilla discusses the background, evolution, and strategic value of the GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) Registry.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

- MCP is an open standard proposed for enhancing interoperability across AI services and tools.
- Its steering committee includes participants from different companies, aiming to create a robust protocol for model context handling in AI applications.

## The GitHub MCP Registry

- The MCP Registry acts as a directory for MCP servers, enabling faster discovery and standardized usage.
- It has become a central piece for developers integrating AI features, especially those using GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code.

## Key Points Discussed

- **Importance of Standards:** Open standards like MCP promote wider adoption and easier integration between tools such as GitHub and VS Code.
- **Cross-company Collaboration:** A steering committee crossing multiple organizations guided MCP's direction and ensured buy-in from key stakeholders.
- **GitHub and VS Code Integration:** Both GitHub Copilot and VS Code use the MCP Registry to help developers locate and leverage MCP servers for customization and enhanced AI model development.
