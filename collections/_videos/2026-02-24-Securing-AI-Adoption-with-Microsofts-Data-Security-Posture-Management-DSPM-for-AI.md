# Secure and Protect AI Usage in your Organization with DSPM for AI

## Overview

As organizations rapidly incorporate AI tools to increase productivity and creativity, new challenges arise regarding data security and risk of leaks. Generative AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini can potentially expose sensitive information if not governed properly.

## Microsoft's Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI

Microsoft's DSPM for AI is designed to address these concerns by:

- **Monitoring AI Activities:** Track usage of AI tools to ensure proper practices and identify potential data exposure.
- **Enforcing Data Protection Policies:** Apply organizational data security policies uniformly across supported AI platforms.
- **Fulfilling Regulatory Requirements:** Automate compliance checks and maintain audit trails to meet industry standards.
- **Enabling Productive and Safe AI Adoption:** Allow users to leverage generative AI's benefits without compromising on governance or information protection.

## Key Features

- **Visibility:** DSPM delivers organization-wide insight into how AI tools are used and where data might flow.
- **Policy Customization:** Security teams can set specific data access and usage policies for different AI scenarios.
- **Incident Response:** Fast identification of data leaks or policy violations, supporting remediation efforts.

## Use Cases

- **Preventing Sensitive Data Leaks:** Ensures confidential company information is not sent to unsanctioned AI tools.
- **Compliance Management:** Maintains records and controls necessary for GDPR, HIPAA, or other regulatory frameworks.
- **Controlled AI Adoption:** Encourages responsible AI use by giving IT and security teams management tools without blocking innovation.

## Supported Platforms

- **Microsoft Copilot** (development and coding contexts)
- **Third-party generative AI**: ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.

## Conclusion

Adopting AI at scale demands enterprise-grade security and data governance. By leveraging DSPM for AI, organizations can strike a balance between innovation and risk, making it possible to use advanced AI tools productively and securely.
