# Will AI Make React Popular Forever?

*Speaker: Idan Gazit (GitHub)*

## Overview

This session explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and the software framework landscape. Idan Gazit discusses whether AI, particularly code generation tools such as GitHub Copilot, will contribute to the sustained popularity of frameworks like React.

## Key Points

- **Consolidation Effect:**
  - AI models learn and excel with widely adopted frameworks like React.
  - This may reinforce dominance and make it tougher for new frameworks to gain adoption.

- **AI Tools Lowering Barriers:**
  - Tools such as GitHub Copilot make it easier for developers to work with complex programming languages and frameworks.
  - Example: Haskell, historically challenging to approach, becomes more accessible with AI guidance.

- **Implications for Framework Evolution:**
  - As AI modeling favors established technologies, the tech ecosystem may see extended dominance of a few major frameworks.
  - However, AI assistance can also democratize access to less popular or harder languages, potentially encouraging diversity.
