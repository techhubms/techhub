# Azure SQL Managed Instance Performance Enhancements with Next-Gen GP

**Presented by Anna Hoffman and Uros Milanovic**

The Next-gen General Purpose (GP) tier for Azure SQL Managed Instance brings major performance upgrades. Key improvements and features discussed:

## What Is Next-gen GP?

- Designed to deliver lower latency and higher throughput compared to the Classic GP tier
- Enables higher IOPS and more storage per managed instance
- Supports additional databases per instance
- Introduces sliders for fine-grained control over IOPS and memory resources

## Classic GP vs. Next-gen GP

- Direct comparison of performance and resource limits between the Classic and Next-gen GP tiers
- **HammerDB-TPROC-C Test Results**: Demonstrates the performance capability gains in transactional workloads

## Portal User Experience

- Walkthrough of the Azure Portal showing adjustable sliders for IOPS and memory
- Simplified interface for configuring compute and storage

## User Value

- Greater flexibility for users to tailor Azure SQL Managed Instance deployments to their workload requirements
- Cost-effective scaling and optimized performance for demanding database scenarios
