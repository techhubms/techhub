# Introducing Spec Kit for Spec-Driven Development in VS Code

In this episode of 'Let it Cook,' Den Delimarsky joins James Montemagno, Burke Holland, and Pierce Boggan to showcase the new [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) project from GitHub. Spec Kit enables Spec-Driven Development, a paradigm where executable specifications generate working code, shifting the focus from disposable docs to actionable blueprints.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

- **Traditional approach:** Specifications are drafted and discarded, with coding taking precedence.
- **Spec-Driven Development:** Specifications become executable artifacts that directly generate implementations, keeping specs central to the workflow.

## Key Features of Spec Kit

- **Executable Specifications:** Write specs that produce real working code.
- **Open Source Toolkit:** Available on GitHub for community contribution and extension.
- **AI Integration:** Use with AI developer tools like GitHub Copilot to boost productivity and align generated code with specification intent.
- **VS Code Friendly:** Seamless integration with Visual Studio Code, leveraging modern dev environments.

## Demo Highlights

- Den demonstrates setting up and using Spec Kit in live coding scenarios.
- Real-time integration with GitHub Copilot for smart code completion and suggestion based on specs.
- Exploration of runnable specs making software design more interactive and reliable.

## Get Started

- [Spec Kit Project on GitHub](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
- [Spec-Driven Development Blog](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/)

## Contributors and Presenters
