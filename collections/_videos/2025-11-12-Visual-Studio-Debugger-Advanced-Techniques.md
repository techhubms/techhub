# Visual Studio Debugger: Advanced Techniques

Unlock the full potential of Visual Studio's debugger with cutting-edge techniques and powerful features aimed at modern .NET developers. This session guides you through:

## Advanced Breakpoints

- **Conditional Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints that trigger only when certain conditions are met, reducing unnecessary stops and focusing on relevant scenarios.
- **Tracepoints**: Output custom trace messages during code execution without halting the application, aiding in non-intrusive investigation.
- **Data Breakpoints**: Watch for value changes in specific variables or memory locations, even outside the immediate scope.

## AI-Powered Debugging

- **Insights & Suggestions**: Utilize the latest AI enhancements in Visual Studio to detect bugs faster and get actionable troubleshooting tips directly within your development environment.

## Troubleshooting Async Code

- Learn techniques for debugging asynchronous code, including best practices for call stack navigation and tracking complex asynchronous flows.

## Memory Analysis

- Gain a deeper understanding of how to identify and resolve memory issues using available diagnostic tools within Visual Studio.

## Productivity Tools

- **Watch Window & Immediate Window**: Leverage these features to evaluate expressions, experiment with code fixes, and instantly test hypotheses during a debugging session.
