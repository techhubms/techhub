# Building Scalable AI Apps with Azure SQL Database Hyperscale

## Session Overview

This advanced session (Microsoft Ignite 2025, BRK126) addresses modern strategies for developing AI-driven applications that leverage Azure SQL Database Hyperscale for secure scalability.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Native Vector Indexes**: Achieve efficient semantic search in SQL databases by implementing vector indexing for AI-powered search and retrieval processes.
- **Read Scale-Out for RAG**: Support low-latency retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) at scale by distributing read workloads.
- **Secure Model Invocation with Microsoft Foundry**: Invoking AI models securely from T-SQL, enabling integration with the AI model of your choice within database workflows.
- **Continuous Priming**: Enhance performance and readiness in Hyperscale environments with continuous data preparation and priming.
- **Cost Management Strategies**: Utilize serverless and elastic pool features in Azure SQL Database to optimize costs for dynamic workloads.
- **Modernization via Microservices and Cloud Hosting**: Migrate and modernize legacy apps with Azure microservices and cloud-native hosting.
- **AI-Driven Automation**: Streamline document processing and knowledge graph creation using embedded AI within SQL workflows.
- **Embeddings for Semantic Search**: Integrate vector embeddings for advanced AI queries directly within your SQL data estate.
