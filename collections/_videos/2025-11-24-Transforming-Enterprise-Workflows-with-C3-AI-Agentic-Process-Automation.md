# Transforming Enterprise Workflows with C3 AI Agentic Process Automation

## Overview

This Microsoft Ignite 2025 breakout session, led by John Abelt and Nikhil Krishnan, demonstrates the potential of C3 AI Agentic Process Automation to revolutionize enterprise workflows. Unlike traditional rules-based robotic process automation (RPA) systems, C3 AI’s platform allows end-users to describe, deploy, and monitor both fully automated and human-in-the-loop workflows, with a focus on intelligence, adaptability, and large-scale data integration.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Agentic Process Automation:**
  - The platform enables users to build sophisticated workflows by leveraging both enterprise and external data sources.
- **Case Studies:**
  - Real-world applications from Shell, Nucor, Dow, and pharmaceutical companies underscore the platform's versatility—in supply chains, finance, and more.
- **Workflow Monitoring and Tools:**
  - Demonstrates intelligent workflow monitoring, evaluation tools, and management of unstructured output.
- **Data Fusion and Ontologies:**
  - Shows how complex data fusion and ontology setup aid in intelligent analysis, such as supply chain delay simulations.
- **Live Demo:**
  - Walkthrough of the Studio interface and a financial services application, including a deep dive into flexible banking ontology structures.

## Practical Insights

- **Automation Beyond RPA:**
  - The session emphasizes adaptability and reliability, positioning agentic process automation as a step forward from traditional workflow engines.
- **Intelligent Data Usage:**
  - Discusses how the platform models and utilizes complex, multi-source data for real-time analytics and advanced decision-making.
- **User Empowerment:**
  - Enables users, including non-developers, to create tailor-made workflows by describing process intents rather than coding logic.

## Who Should Watch

Technology professionals interested in next-generation automation, workflow architects, and enterprise IT decision-makers will find actionable insights for adopting intelligent automation at scale.
