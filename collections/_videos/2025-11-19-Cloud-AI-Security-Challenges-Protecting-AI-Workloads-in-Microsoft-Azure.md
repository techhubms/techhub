# Cloud AI Security Challenges: Protecting AI Workloads in Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Ignite 2025 brought together experts to address the new security landscape for organizations deploying AI workloads on cloud platforms. This session, led by Jonathan Kaye Solomon, focuses on the distinct challenges and recommended strategies for protecting AI-driven environments in Microsoft Azure.

## Key Discussion Points

- **Blind Spots in Cloud AI Workloads**
  - Attackers exploit east-west traffic, encrypted communications, and limited visibility to move laterally and evade detection.
  - Compliance risks escalate as traditional monitoring falls short in dynamic cloud and AI scenarios.

- **Network Security Evolution**
  - Overview of connectivity trends: SD-WAN, VPN, and Virtual WAN architectures.
  - Introduction to corporate gateways and application-level access controls for AI workloads.

- **AI-Specific Attack Vectors**
  - Generative AI and LLMs bring new vulnerabilities and require adapted security postures.
  - Existing firewall and Web Application Firewall (WAF) protections can still mitigate risks for Gen AI APIs.

- **Practical Demonstration**
  - Live setup using Check Point CloudGuard Network Security within Microsoft Azure.
  - Integration of CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) supporting 70+ solutions to enhance Azure AI security.

## Recommended Practices

- Employ comprehensive east-west traffic analysis to detect lateral movement in AI workloads.
- Maintain robust application-level access controls, adapting policy for dynamic AI environments.
- Supplement traditional firewall and WAF with specialized solutions for generative AI APIs.
- Integrate a CNAPP to unify security management across diverse cloud and AI architectures.
