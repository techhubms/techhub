# Why TypeScript Had to Be Open Source

In this video, legendary programming language designer Anders Hejlsberg discusses the internal struggles within Microsoft regarding the open-sourcing of TypeScript. Hejlsberg explains the rationale for making TypeScript open source, highlighting that a commercial, closed-source approach would have significantly limited adoption and community contribution.

## Key Topics

- **Internal Struggle at Microsoft:** Hejlsberg reveals the intense internal debates leading up to the decision.
- **Importance of Open Source:** He argues that openness was essential for credibility and community trust, allowing TypeScript to be used widely outside Microsoft.
- **GitHub Migration:** Moving TypeScript development to GitHub in 2014 was a turning point. This enabled direct contributions from the global developer community and improved transparency.
- **Downsides of Closed Source:** The video covers why a proprietary approach would have restricted feedback channels and hindered adoption.
