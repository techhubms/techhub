# How GitHub Copilot Hacked a Furby

In this creative keynote demonstration from GitHub Universe, Martin, GitHub's VP of Developer Relations, shows how GitHub Copilot can be used beyond traditional software engineering tasks. The project involved hacking his son's old Furby toy, enabling it to sing, talk, and dance!

## Project Highlights

- **AI Coding with GitHub Copilot**: Used GitHub Copilot to accelerate development and problem-solving during the hacking process.
- **Hardware Integration**: Rewired the Furby, connected its motors and sensors to a programmable microcontroller.
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Enabled the Furby to respond to smart home commands via Home Assistant.
- **Creativity with Code**: Demonstrated code generation by Copilot for device control, speech synthesis, and coordinating movements.
- **A Choir of Furbys**: The demonstration included multiple toys acting in sync, showcasing the power of automation and AI-driven orchestration.

## Key Technologies Used

- **GitHub Copilot** for code generation and troubleshooting
- **Home Assistant** for smart home integration
- **Microcontrollers** (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Arduino)
- **Python (likely)** or other prototyping languages
- **IoT hardware hacking**

## What You Can Learn

- Connecting AI coding assistants to real-world hardware projects
- Integrating legacy toys or gadgets with modern smart home setups
- Collaborating with AI on creative or unconventional engineering tasks
- Using Copilot for rapid prototyping
