# What's New with the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

In this GitHub Checkout episode, Tim and Andrea Griffiths introduce groundbreaking updates to the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent. These features empower developers to assign, track, and validate coding tasks from virtually anywhere.

## Highlights

- **Assign Coding Tasks from Anywhere:** Use the new GitHub Agents panel, a universal overlay that lets you create and assign tasks directly from any part of GitHub, whether you're at your desktop or on your mobile device.
- **Mobile Task Assignment:** Initiate coding requests from your phone, making it possible to move work forward even while away from your main workstation.
- **Agent-Driven Web Browsing:** The Copilot agent can use a browser to validate changes it makes, capturing screenshots to document its process. These are then embedded directly into pull requests for transparency and easy review.
- **Clearing Technical Debt:** A key use case is automating routine or technical debt-related tasks, allowing developers to focus their energies where it matters most.
- **Extending with MCP Servers:** The system supports extensions via MCP servers, enabling further customization or expanded capabilities for organizations.
- **Transparent Pricing and Usage:** Details are covered on current and future pricing models, helping teams plan their adoption.
- **Roadmap and Feedback:** The video touches on upcoming features and encourages users to provide feedback to shape the next iterations of Copilot agents.
