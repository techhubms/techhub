# Getting Started with MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Presented by Dan Clarke on Nick Chapsas' channel**

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new concept aimed at providing developers with a standardized and consistent way to interact with data across different large language models (LLMs). As AI and LLM adoption surges, MCPs are designed to simplify and streamline these integrations.

## What You'll Learn

- What the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is
- The significance of MCP in the context of AI and LLMs
- How MCP could unify how developers access and transfer data among various LLMs
- Relevance to Microsoft developers, especially those working with C# and .NET
