# MCP Dev Days Day 2: From Concept to Code

**Presented by: Microsoft Developer**

## Overview

The second day of MCP Dev Days builds momentum for developers seeking to implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in real-world applications. The keynote presents a comprehensive roadmap, transitioning from proof-of-concept stages to the deployment of production-ready MCP servers.

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Essential Building Blocks for MCP

- **Azure Functions:** Leveraged for serverless, scalable compute to handle context updates and communication requirements.
- **API Management:** Powers standardized and secure access to MCP endpoints and services, enabling enterprises to integrate MCP servers within existing infrastructure.
- **Security Best Practices:** Emphasis on securing communication, managing secrets, and implementing authentication/authorization across the MCP stack.

### 2. Prompt-Driven Development Workflows

- Demonstrates how MCP enables prompt-driven workflows for rapid prototyping and evolving agent behavior.
- Highlights development feedback cycles with real-time code updates using Visual Studio Code.

### 3. Real-World MCP Architectures

- Examines how organizations structure MCP implementations for both enterprise-scale and edge computing scenarios.
- Shares case studies of companies deploying MCP-powered features, detailing architectural choices, scalability considerations, and lessons learned in the field.

### 4. From Demo Agents to Production-Ready Solutions

- Strategies for evolving AI agents from experimental demos into robust, dependable solutions using MCP.
- Tools and techniques for rigorous testing, monitoring, and scaling MCP servers.

### 5. Learning Resources and Community Engagement

- Access the MCP beginners curriculum: [MCP for Beginners](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners)
- Try out MCP server features in Visual Studio Code: [VS Code MCP Integration](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp)
- Engage with the developer community: [Azure AI Foundry Discord](https://aka.ms/azureaifoundry/discord)
- Stay updated with Visual Studio Code developments: [VS Code Live Release Parties](https://aka.ms/VSCode/Live)
- Discover new MCP integration tools with Foundry Agent Service: [Model Context Protocol Support Preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/announcing-model-context-protocol-support-preview-in-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service/)

## Conclusion

The keynote equips developers with the foundational knowledge, architectural insights, and practical tools needed to deliver secure and scalable MCP solutions. Through real-world examples and a focus on Azure services, it sets a clear path for transitioning MCP agents from concept to code in production environments.
