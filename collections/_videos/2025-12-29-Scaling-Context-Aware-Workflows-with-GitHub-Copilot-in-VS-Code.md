# Scaling Context-Aware Workflows with GitHub Copilot in VS Code

Unlock the full potential of GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code by transforming it into a truly context-aware AI pair programmer. This session explores:

- **Custom Instructions & Prompt Engineering:** Learn how to tailor Copilot’s suggestions to your codebase and coding practices using advanced prompt methods and custom configuration.
- **MCPs and Context Engineering:** Utilize Microsoft Copilot Plugins (MCPs) and context engineering approaches to inject architectural decisions, project structure, and team workflows into Copilot’s reasoning.
- **Enterprise Frameworks:** Gain practical frameworks and templates that scale context-aware Copilot workflows across large codebases and teams.
