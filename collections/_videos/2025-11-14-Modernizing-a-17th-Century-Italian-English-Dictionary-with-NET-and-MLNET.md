# Modernizing a 17th Century Italian-English Dictionary

In this session, dotnet presents a technical walkthrough of bringing John Florio's Renaissance-era Italian-English dictionary into the 21st century. The approach combines classic text resources with modern Microsoft technologies, demonstrating:

## Key Technologies

- **.NET** for application development and integration.
- **ML.NET** to train a custom vector embeddings model, enabling intelligent retrieval and translation features for historical text.
- **CosmosDb** to provide scalable, cloud-native storage for dictionary data and machine learning results.
- **Aspire** to orchestrate and glue together the various technological components involved in the project.

## Project Steps

1. **Digitization & Ingestion**: The original dictionary text is digitized and analyzed for integration.
2. **Custom Model Training**: ML.NET is used to create a tailored vector embeddings model, improving translation and lookup performance specifically for Renaissance vocabulary.
3. **Cloud Storage**: All structured data, vectors, and dictionary entries are stored and indexed in Azure CosmosDb, using cloud-native scalability and querying.
4. **Application Architecture**: Aspire arranges how these components communicate, supporting robust API endpoints and service integration.

## Modernization Outcomes

- Enhanced accessibility for translators and researchers working with early-modern texts.
- New capabilities for semantic search and linguistic analysis using recent machine learning techniques.
- Demonstration of modern software patterns (API, model training, cloud storage) applied to legacy content with Microsoft tools.
