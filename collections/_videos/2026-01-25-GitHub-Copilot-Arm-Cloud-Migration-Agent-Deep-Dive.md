# GitHub Copilot Arm Cloud Migration Agent Deep Dive

In this GitHub Code & Community live stream, Eric Sondhi (PM, Arm) and Alexis Abril (Sr. Partner Engineer, GitHub) join Andrea Griffiths to explore a custom agent built for GitHub Copilot. This agent assists developers in migrating workloads from traditional x86 environments to Arm-based cloud infrastructure.

## What’s Covered

- **Custom Copilot Agent**: Built specifically for migration to Arm architectures, this GitHub Copilot-powered agent examines your codebase to identify architecture-specific issues.
- **Cloud Migration Workflow**:
  - Scans your existing project for incompatibilities or optimizations needed for Arm
  - Provides actionable suggestions on code adjustments
  - Guides developers through preparing containers to run across both x86 and Arm platforms
- **Arm MCP Server**: The migration workflow is powered by the Arm MCP Server, enabling seamless transition between hardware architectures.
- **Live Demo Insights**: The team demonstrates how the agent operates when pointed at a real-world codebase, highlighting the detection of architecture-specific challenges and how the assistant helps resolve them.

## Key Takeaways

- **Automation**: Streamline your migration process from x86 to Arm using AI-driven code analysis
- **Container Support**: Ensures your application containers run efficiently on both hardware platforms
- **Practical Guidance**: Learn common pitfalls and best practices for multi-architecture cloud deployments

## Speakers

- Eric Sondhi (Product Manager, Arm)
- Alexis Abril (Sr. Partner Engineer, GitHub)
- Andrea Griffiths (GitHub)
