# Introducing the new Azure Copilot for the new era of Intelligent Agents (BRK145)

**Speakers:** Annie Pearl, Demi Ajayi, Ruhiyyih Mahalati  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Session Level:** Intermediate (200)

## Overview

This session introduces the next generation of Azure Copilot, focusing on 'agentic AI' – intelligent agents that act both independently and collaboratively with users to manage, secure, and evolve cloud environments. The speakers discuss how new capabilities are enabling IT pros, DevOps, and developers to move beyond traditional automation through:

- **Automated incident response**
- **Infrastructure provisioning**
- **Security posture management**
- **Production environment oversight**

## Key Topics and Chapters

- **Emergence of Agentic CloudOps:** Merging AI with cloud operations for smarter, more autonomous workflows.
- **Transition to Agent Scale:** Moving from manual tasks to intelligent, automated workflows.
- **Context IQ (Grounding Menu):** A new feature for enhanced contextual prompting in Azure Copilot.
- **Agent Mode Deep Dive:** Exploring reasoning models, sub-orchestration, and how multiple agents execute complex tasks together.
- **Collaboration Between Agents:** Demonstrating how deployment and troubleshooting agents work in tandem to streamline production management.
- **Resiliency Agent Demo:** Showcasing how the new resiliency agent assists in maintaining stable cloud operations.

## Benefits

Attendees learn how these agents:

- Enhance collaboration and autonomy within Azure environments
