# VS Code Live: Agent Sessions Day - Keynote

This keynote demonstrates how Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has evolved to support unified multi-agent development. Developers can now delegate, orchestrate, and work collaboratively with AI agents across:

- **Local environments**
- **Background processes**
- **Cloud platforms**

## Key Highlights

- **Seamless Agent Orchestration**: Manage and interact with multiple AI agents within VS Code, optimizing productivity across various workflows.
- **Unified Development Environment**: A single platform for agent-based workflows, supporting both local and cloud scenarios.
- **Advanced Collaboration**: Collaborate with AI agents as part of the development team, sharing context and delegating specialized tasks.
- **Security Improvements**: New updates emphasize the secure integration of agents, ensuring code and environment safety.
- **Live Demonstrations**: The keynote includes demo scenarios showing real-time agent collaboration and orchestration.
