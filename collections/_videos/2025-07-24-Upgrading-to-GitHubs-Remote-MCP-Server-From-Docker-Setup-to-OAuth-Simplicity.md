## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, which gained popularity as the top GitHub repository, has received a significant upgrade. This video, presented by GitHub on their Checkout channel, introduces the new remote MCP server, highlighting changes designed to improve usability and extensibility for developers.

## What Is the Remote MCP Server?

The remote MCP server extends the functionality of the original local server, making it accessible remotely and enabling new integration and control possibilities. The video explains how migrating to a remote model can benefit teams working on distributed code bases and streamline collaboration.

## Installing the Remote Server

A walkthrough covers the step-by-step process for setting up the remote server, including prerequisites and key differences from the Docker-based installation method of the local version. The guide demonstrates how OAuth is integrated for a simplified authentication and user management experience.

## Local vs. Remote Server Security

Security considerations are covered in depth. The video details how running the MCP server remotely introduces new security challenges but also leverages GitHub’s OAuth mechanisms for secure and simplified user authentication. The team compares security profiles between the local Docker deployment and the remote server.

## Gaining More Control with the Remote Server

The video explores the configuration and access control improvements possible with the remote variant. New features allow administrators and teams to fine-tune permissions, manage dynamic toolsets, and define contextual functionality for various project needs.

## Dynamic Toolsets Explained

A key feature of the remote MCP server is the support for dynamic toolsets. This concept allows teams to tailor the server’s tools and integrations in real time, expanding the possibilities for automation and supporting diverse workflows.

## Why Switch to the Remote Server?

Motivations for upgrading include improved scalability, better security management, OAuth-powered authentication, easier onboarding, and enhanced customization options. The presenters argue that these factors provide compelling reasons for both individual developers and teams to make the switch.

## The Future of the MCP Server

The video closes by discussing ongoing development plans, community-driven improvements, and the commitment to keeping the MCP server open source and responsive to user feedback.
