# AI-Assisted Development Workflow with mirrord and Azure Kubernetes

AI-powered code editors speed up development, but distributed cloud applications can make testing and feedback challenging. This episode demonstrates using mirrord—a tool that lets you run local code inside a Kubernetes cluster (specifically AKS on Azure) without full deployments.

## Key Topics Covered

- **AI Development Workflow**: How AI editors generate code, and why realistic feedback environments matter for correctness.
- **Existing Challenges**: Standard CI/CD and staging environments are slow and may not reflect production accurately.
- **Using mirrord**: Mirrord allows developers to run code locally while intercepting traffic from a remote Kubernetes cluster, enabling fast, accurate testing.
- **Azure Integration**: Demos and resources specifically show mirrord operating on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), highlighting Microsoft’s support for OSS tooling.
- **Demo Highlights**:
  - Setting up mirrord locally
  - Connecting to AKS
  - Debugging and feedback cycles
  - Realistic environment for AI code generation

## Summary

With mirrord and AKS, developers can directly test AI-generated code locally in a production-like cloud setting, getting faster, more reliable feedback. This workflow reduces bottlenecks from traditional CI and staging, increasing confidence in code quality for distributed applications.
