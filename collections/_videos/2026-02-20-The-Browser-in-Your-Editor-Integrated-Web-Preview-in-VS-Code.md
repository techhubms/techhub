# The Browser in Your Editor: Integrated Web Preview in VS Code

Visual Studio Code now offers an integrated browser that lets developers preview and inspect their web applications directly inside the editor.

## Key Features

- **Embedded DevTools**: Use familiar Chrome DevTools right within VS Code to debug and inspect UI, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Authentication Support**: Log in to web applications with support for authentication flows directly in the integrated browser panel.
- **Select Elements for AI Chat Context**: Highlight elements in your web app to use as intelligent context within VS Code's AI chat features. This enables prompts based on real application state and UI.
- **Streamlined Dev Loop**: Preview changes instantly without switching to an external browser. This tight feedback loop helps you iterate on web projects quickly.
- **Agent Enablement**: The integrated browser is designed so that code agents and AI-powered tools can interact with your full web application context, opening the door to advanced in-editor automation and guidance.
