# Microsoft Discovery Platform Overview: AI-Driven R&D on Azure

Microsoft introduces a new enterprise platform designed to accelerate research and development through advanced AI capabilities. Built on Azure, the Discovery platform empowers scientists and engineers to harness a team of specialized AI agents that adapt and learn over time, supporting not only reasoning but also conducting R&D autonomously.

## Key Features

- **Agentic AI Platform:** Orchestrate teams of AI agents for scientific research, allowing continuous, adaptive R&D cycles.
- **Built on Azure:** Utilizes Azure High-Performance Computing (HPC) and the Azure AI Foundry infrastructure to deliver scalable compute and AI services.
- **Research Enablement:** Researchers guide and manage specialized agents to accelerate workflows, experimental design, and discovery, bringing the benefits of AI directly into scientific processes.

## Getting Started

- **Azure HPC:** [Learn more about Azure HPC](https://msft.it/6054Sj5IK)
- **Azure AI Foundry:** [Explore Azure AI Foundry infrastructure](https://msft.it/6055Sj5Iz)
- **Sign Up for Updates:** [Keep informed on the latest developments](https://msft.it/6056Sj5IM)

## Use Cases

- Scientific discovery
- Iterative experimental cycles
- Automated research and development tasks

The platform is positioned to make R&D more continuous and efficient, marrying the power of AI orchestration with the robust infrastructure of Azure. Scientists and engineers are now able to leverage adaptive agents for innovation and knowledge generation at scale.
