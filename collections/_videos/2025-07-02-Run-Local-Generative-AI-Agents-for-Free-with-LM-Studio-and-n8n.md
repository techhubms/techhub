# Run Local Generative AI Agents for Free with LM Studio and n8n

Author: Alireza Chegini | AI Skills for Your Career

## Overview

This video demonstrates how to use open-source generative AI models on your own computer—entirely free and without reliance on paid APIs or subscriptions. It’s intended for developers, automation enthusiasts, and anyone wishing to prototype or learn about AI agents and chat workflows in a hands-on way.

## Key Topics

- Why choose local AI tools vs. paid cloud APIs
- How to install LM Studio on Windows, Mac, or Linux
- Setting up and running local language models (e.g., LLaMA, Mistral)
- Using LM Studio's interface and testing model outputs
- Installing and running n8n via Docker
- Creating chat agent workflows in n8n
- Connecting LM Studio to n8n using API integrations
- Adding conversational memory to your agent
- Tips for further experimentation and learning

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. LM Studio Installation

- Download LM Studio from: [https://lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
- Supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Walkthrough of installation and interface basics

### 2. Download & Run Local Models

- Example setup with LLaMA (other models such as Mistral also supported)
- How to fetch models from online repositories, import, and run locally
- Test the generative capabilities inside LM Studio

### 3. n8n Workflow Automation

- Install n8n using Docker for ease of setup: [https://n8n.io](https://n8n.io)
- Overview of workflow builder
- Create a simple chat agent workflow

### 4. Integrate LM Studio and n8n
