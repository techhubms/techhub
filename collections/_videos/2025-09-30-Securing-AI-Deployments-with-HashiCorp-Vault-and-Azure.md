# Securing AI Deployments with HashiCorp Vault & Azure

**Speakers:**

- David Wright – Global Field CTO, HashiCorp ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-wright-57336a4/))
- Govind Kamtamneni ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thegovind/)), ([X](https://x.com/t2govind))

## Overview

This episode addresses "last-mile" automation and security challenges for production AI deployments. It explains why AI projects often stall pre-production, and how Microsoft Azure and HashiCorp's suite—Vault, Packer, Vault Radar—enable secure, scalable solutions.

## Key Topics

### 1. Why AI Projects Stall Before Production

- Security and automation bottlenecks
- Difficulty of dynamic credential and secret management at scale
- Lack of traceability and governance in automated workflows

### 2. HashiCorp Tools for AI Production

- **Vault:** Dynamic credential management, policy enforcement, automation
- **Packer:** Infrastructure automation and consistency
- **Vault Radar:** Enhanced visibility and governance for secrets

### 3. Integrating with Microsoft Azure

- Use of Azure Verified Modules for rapid infrastructure setup
- Context-aware security leveraging Azure and HashiCorp integrations

### 4. Security Challenges & Solutions

- "Confused Deputy" problem: how to prevent improper privilege elevation
- Dynamic, context-based credential assignment for AI agents
- Governance and auditability embedded in the platform

### 5. Real-World Demo

- Multi-agent AI app using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Vault integration for secure, traceable secret access by AI agents
- End-to-end workflow from code to production with full auditing

### 6. Best Practices

- Use of verified modules for repeatable, secure deployments
- Role-based access controls and audit logs
- Scaling credential management across the enterprise
