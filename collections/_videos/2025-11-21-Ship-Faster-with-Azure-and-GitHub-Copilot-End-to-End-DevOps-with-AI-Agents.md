# Ship Faster with Azure and GitHub Copilot: End-to-End DevOps with AI Agents

**Speakers:** Nir Mashkowski, Mandy Whaley
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 – BRK109

## Overview

This session explores how teams can deliver Azure applications more efficiently by leveraging GitHub Copilot and a suite of intelligent agents throughout the DevOps lifecycle. From design to deployment and ongoing operations, the session walks through practical AI-powered tools that accelerate planning, coding, automation, and incident response.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Coding Agent, App Modernization agent, Cloud Architecture agent:** Automate planning, coding, and cloud architecture decisions.
- **GitHub Copilot for Azure:** Accelerate deployment and make diagnostics easier by integrating Copilot directly with Azure workflows.
- **Azure MCP Server:** Simplifies continuous deployment and diagnostics.
- **SRE Agent & Testing Agent:** Extend automation into production and quality assurance with AI-driven workflows.
- **Integration with Third-party Tools:** Automated incident responses via PagerDuty SRE subagent; remediation steps with Azure Container Apps and Datadog.

## Chapters Recap

- **Introductions & Tooling Overview:** Introduction of the Azure Dev Tools team and environment setup in VS Code.
- **Spec Kit Constitution Command:** Demonstrates how to create infrastructure constitutions directly from your editor.
- **Automating with AI:** Details the transition from all-in-one agents to human-assisting agents focused on supporting development and operations.
- **SRE Automation:** Use cases for PagerDuty and Datadog integrations to automate and control incident response directly from Azure environments.
- **Copilot Integration:** Automated code updates and issue resolutions with GitHub Copilot.

## Notable Toolchain Integrations

- **VS Code** for authoring and automation
- **GitHub Copilot & Copilot for Azure** for code, workflow, and deployment automation
- **Azure MCP Server** for deployment pipeline management
- **PagerDuty** for automated incident response
