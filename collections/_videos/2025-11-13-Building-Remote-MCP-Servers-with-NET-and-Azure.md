# Building Remote MCP Servers with .NET and Azure

This session demonstrates how AI assistants can utilize the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect with external tools and data sources by building remote MCP servers with .NET and Azure. The approach enhances automation, improves scalability, and allows flexible hosting—making it suitable for both local prototypes and cloud deployments.

## Key Benefits of Remote MCP Servers

- **Automation**: Seamless integration with external systems and processes.
- **Collaboration**: Shared access to context-aware servers for teams and applications.
- **Scalability**: Azure hosting allows dynamic scaling as workloads grow.
- **Flexible Hosting**: Choose between local and cloud-based deployments.
