# Preventing Data Exfiltration with Microsoft Purview's Layered Protection Strategy

**Session Speakers:** Vivian Ma, Shekhar Palta, Roberto Yglesias
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 | Session BRK250

## Overview

This advanced breakout session demonstrates how Microsoft Purview enables a unified, layered approach to data security, aiming to block data exfiltration in increasingly complex environments. Protection strategies cover AI and non-AI apps, devices, browsers, networks, and more, addressing modern threats arising from cloud adoption and consumer AI apps in the enterprise.

## Key Topics

- ### Innovations in Purview for Unified Data Security

  - New features supporting both AI-driven and traditional data protection
  - Integration with Edge browser for secure enterprise browsing

- ### Emerging Data Exfiltration Scenarios

  - Trends in data leakage across clouds, apps, and unmanaged endpoints
  - Risks posed by consumer AI tools in workplace settings

- ### Adaptive DLP Policies

  - Defining application scopes to target unmanaged and AI applications
  - Real-world example walkthrough (Miguel's sensitive data handling)

- ### Securing Unmanaged Devices

  - Techniques for managing security on BYOD and non-corporate devices
  - Challenges and solutions for protection in cloud environments

## Practical Strategies

- Enforcing adaptive data loss prevention (DLP) policies via Purview
- Scoping DLP to both managed and unmanaged applications
- Integrating Purview with enterprise browsers like Microsoft Edge
- Monitoring and responding to risks from consumer AI and cloud apps
