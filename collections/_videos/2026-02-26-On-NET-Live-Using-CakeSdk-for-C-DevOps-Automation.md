# On .NET Live: Using Cake.Sdk for C# DevOps Automation

## Overview

In this episode, Mattias Karlsson, Maira Wenzel, Scott Addie, and Frank Boucher explore how to use Cake.Sdk with the latest .NET versions to create DevOps definitions as file-based C# applications. This approach brings the power of the full IDE, debugging, and Cake APIs into modern build and automation workflows.

## Key Highlights

- **File-Based C# DevOps Definitions**: Learn how to build automation scripts as standalone C# files (`cake.cs`), moving away from traditional build scripting approaches.
- **IDE Integration**: Take advantage of features like code completion, refactoring, and debugging in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Run the same DevOps automation scripts across different platforms and environments, thanks to .NET's cross-platform capabilities.
- **Using Cake APIs**: Harness Cake's rich set of APIs for build orchestration, dependency management, and more.
- **Clean and Maintainable**: C# scripts offer a modern, readable alternative to legacy build script languages, enhancing maintainability.

## Getting Started Steps

1. **Install .NET and Cake.Sdk**
   - Ensure .NET SDK is available on your system.
   - Add Cake.Sdk NuGet package to your project.
2. **Create a `cake.cs` File**
   - Write your build and automation logic in a C# script.
3. **IDE Setup**
   - Open the script in Visual Studio or a C#-friendly editor for full IntelliSense and debugging support.
4. **Execution**
   - Run `dotnet run cake.cs` to execute your automation tasks locally or in CI/CD environments.

## Benefits

- **Developer Productivity**: Write and debug DevOps scripts with familiar C# workflows.
- **Consistency**: Use the same language and tools across development and automation tasks.
- **Scalability**: Portable scripts can be shared and reused across projects and teams.
