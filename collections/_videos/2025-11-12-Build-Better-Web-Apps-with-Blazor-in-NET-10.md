# Build Better Web Apps with Blazor in .NET 10

Explore how Blazor in .NET 10 is transforming web development by introducing new features and performance improvements:

## Key Highlights

- **Built-in WebAuthN and Passkeys Support**: Enhance your app security with integrated WebAuthN and support for passkeys, reducing password dependencies and helping developers implement secure authentication out of the box.
- **Scaffolding for Entra ID Authentication**: Quickly add Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) authentication to Blazor apps with new scaffolding tools, making it easier to build secure, enterprise-ready solutions.
- **Improved App Diagnostics**: Benefit from enhanced diagnostics that make monitoring and troubleshooting Blazor applications more accessible, enabling developers to identify and resolve issues with greater efficiency.
- **Performance Improvements**: Experience faster load times and more responsive apps, thanks to optimizations in the Blazor framework and runtime for .NET 10.
- **Developer Productivity Enhancements**:
    - Faster Hot Reload for rapid development cycles
    - Component state persistence to maintain user interactions during refreshes
    - QuickGrid enhancements for better data grid capabilities
    - Simplified integration testing to streamline quality assurance
