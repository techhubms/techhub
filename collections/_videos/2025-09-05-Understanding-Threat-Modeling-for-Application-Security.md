# Understanding Threat Modeling for Application Security

In this video, Michael Howard addresses the question "What is a threat model?" and provides a clear explanation for developers and architects. He characterizes threat modeling as a design-time blueprint for security that ensures critical questions about authentication, data protection, and privilege are asked prior to shipping an application.

## Key Points Covered

- **Definition of Threat Modeling:** A structured approach to identifying and addressing potential security threats during the application design phase.
- **Purpose:** Helps ensure teams consider authentication, data protection, and privilege requirements before deployment, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.
- **Practical Application:** Encourages asking the "right questions" early, acting as a checklist to guide secure application development.

> "Threat modeling is a design-time blueprint for security to make sure you’ve asked the right questions about authentication, data protection, and privilege before you ship your app."  —Michael Howard

## Why It Matters

- **Proactive Security:** Early identification of risks saves remediation effort and prevents security issues from reaching production.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Addresses multiple aspects of application security, including access control and data management.
