# Building AI Agents with Semantic Kernel, MCP Servers, and Python

Hosted by Microsoft Developer, this episode continues the exploration of the Semantic Kernel AI Agents Toolbox. Evan Mattson demonstrates how to build intelligent agents by integrating Semantic Kernel with MCP Servers and Python.

## Key Highlights

- **Invoking MCP Tools**: Learn how MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform) tools are leveraged during the construction of AI agents with Semantic Kernel.
- **Using Different MCP Servers**: The episode covers both the GitHub MCP Server and the Microsoft Learn MCP Server, showing their distinct roles in agent workflows.
- **Azure AI Foundry Integration**: Find out how Azure AI Foundry can be integrated into these workflows for advanced AI capabilities.
- **Hands-on Demos**:
  - Setting up MCP plugins within Semantic Kernel
  - Executing sample AI agent workflows using Python
  - Real-world examples to apply in your own projects
