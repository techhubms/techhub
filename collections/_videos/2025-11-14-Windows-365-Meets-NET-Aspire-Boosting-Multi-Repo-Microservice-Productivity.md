# Windows 365 Meets .NET Aspire: Boosting Multi-Repo Microservice Productivity

In this session, dotnet demonstrates how the Windows 365 global engineering teams use .NET Aspire to improve productivity in multi-repository microservice development environments.

## Key Features Highlighted

- **F5 Innovate Experience**: Showcases the streamlined process for cloning, building, and running microservices using F5 workflows.
- **AddMicroservice Extension**: Facilitates onboarding and integration of microservices across multiple repositories with .NET Aspire, enabling seamless collaboration between teams.
- **RunAsEmulator Extension**: Allows loading dependencies from microservice containers or emulators, making it easier to test services locally and replicate production-like environments.
- **Seed Data for Local Testing**: Built-in features to add seed data, supporting effective and realistic local testing scenarios without complex setup.
- **HTTP File Template-based Microservice Emulators**: Demonstrates the use of HTTP file templates to emulate dependencies and test various scenarios, further supporting local and integration testing.

## Demonstration

The session includes a practical, end-to-end demonstration showcasing how engineering teams can:

- Onboard microservices with the AddMicroservice extension
- Load and test dependencies using the RunAsEmulator extension
- Employ seed data and emulator templates for thorough local testing
- Enhance collaboration and reproducibility in a multi-repo, cloud-native engineering world

## Benefits

- Improved developer productivity and collaboration
- Streamlined onboarding of new microservices
- Simplified local development and testing workflows
- Scalable practices for large engineering teams
