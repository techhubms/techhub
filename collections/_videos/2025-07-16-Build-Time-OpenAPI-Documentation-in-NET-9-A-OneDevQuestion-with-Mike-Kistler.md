## Build-Time OpenAPI Documentation in .NET 9: Insights from Mike Kistler

In a recent episode of #OneDevQuestion, Mike Kistler highlights his favorite OpenAPI feature introduced in .NET 9: build-time generation of OpenAPI documentation.

### Key Points Discussed

- **Build-Time Generation**: .NET 9 now supports generating OpenAPI documentation as part of the build process. This eliminates the need for your application to serve the documentation at runtime.
- **Local Usage**: Developers can utilize the generated OpenAPI docs locally, facilitating tasks such as:
  - Linting the API definition to ensure it conforms to best practices
  - Code generation from the OpenAPI specification for clients or servers
  - Applying tools like Spectral to enforce API design conventions

### Benefits

- **Performance and Security**: By moving documentation serving out of the application, runtime overhead and potential exposure are reduced.
- **Increased Flexibility**: Local documentation files offer greater integration with CI/CD pipelines, linting, and external tools—improving the developer experience and code quality.

### Tools Highlighted

- **Spectral**: A popular tool for linting OpenAPI (and other API formats) to enforce consistency and catch issues early.
