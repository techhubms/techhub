## Key Topics Covered

- **End-to-End App Development:**
  - Define business goals in natural language.
  - Instantly generate applications using low-code (Application Canvas) or write full code in Visual Studio Code.
  - Refine, customize, and extend generated apps with code.
  - Securely deploy to enterprise environments.

- **Platform Capabilities:**
  - Build advanced workflows and agents with built-in tools.
  - Integrate dashboards and connect to diverse data sources.
  - Ensure secure, governed deployment with features like versioning and observability.

- **Demonstration Highlights:**
  - Iterative building of applications by AI agents using stored knowledge.
  - Example: Monitoring incidents across distributed assets.
  - Modular workflow construction with minimal effort and small teams.

- **Integration with Microsoft Technologies:**
  - The C3 Agentic AI Platform is powered by Azure, offering scale and unified access to enterprise data via Microsoft Fabric.
  - The platform uses both natural language input and coding environments (VS Code) to support makers and developers.
  - Collaboration features include agent-based builders and Copilot-style support.

## Takeaways

- Accelerate enterprise AI app development with a unified, governed, and observable platform.
- Combine no-code, low-code, and pro-code workflows for maximum flexibility.
- Leverage Microsoft Azure and Fabric for scalable, secure application infrastructure.
