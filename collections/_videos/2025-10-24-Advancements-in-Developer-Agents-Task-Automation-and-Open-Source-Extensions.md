# Advancements in Developer Agents: Task Automation and Open Source Extensions

## Overview

Govind Kamtamneni from Microsoft Developer shares how agents for developers have progressed. These agents, originally designed for code suggestions, now encompass features such as:

- **Automated Task Handling**: Agents can perform more complex development tasks, reducing manual effort.
- **Issue Resolution**: They are capable of identifying and fixing issues, streamlining the troubleshooting process.
- **Open Source Extensions**: A new framework allows open source extensions, fostering community contributions and custom capabilities.

## SRE Agent Example

Microsoft's SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Agent serves as a practical illustration of these advancements. For more detail on the SRE Agent ecosystem and features, visit: [SRE Agent Details](https://msft.it/6055t6E7S)
