# Reimagining IT Operations with Agentic AI on Microsoft Azure

**Speaker:** Deepraj Khot (Microsoft Ignite 2025)

## Introduction

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) demonstrates TAO—an autonomous operations solution leveraging agentic AI and Microsoft Foundry to revolutionize IT infrastructure and application management on Azure.

## Solution Overview

TAO integrates with IT Service Management (ITSM) tools and utilizes SOPs, incident logs, knowledge base articles, event store, and code base. AI agents automate the detection, triage, escalation, and resolution of operational issues.

- *Generalist and Specialist Agents*: Handle broad operational challenges and domain-specific incident resolution.
- *AI Assistant*: Identifies code fixes, automatically submits service requests, manages escalation, and logs actions.

## Feature Highlights

- Supports digital-first, fully automated operational interactions
- Reduces incident volume by up to 25%
- Improves mean time to resolution (MTTR) by up to 30%
- Seamless integration with ITSM workflows
- Utilizes advanced operational datasets for AI-driven issue detection and resolution

## Demo Walkthrough

1. **Overview of Azure platform and operational challenges**
2. **TAO Agents**: Introduction to Generalist and Specialist roles
3. **Incident Detection**: AI assistant identifies need for code fix
4. **Automation**: Service requests raised, issues escalated by AI adviser
5. **User Scenario**: Example user interaction with TAO assistant
6. **Deployment Outcome**: Post-deployment testing confirms successful issue resolution
