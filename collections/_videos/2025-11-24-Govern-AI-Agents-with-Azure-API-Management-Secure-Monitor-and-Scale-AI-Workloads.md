# Govern AI Agents with Azure API Management: Secure, Monitor, and Scale AI Workloads

**Presented by:** Mike Budzynski & Anish Tallapureddy | Microsoft Ignite 2025

## Overview

Enterprises scaling AI require robust governance and security. This session highlights how Azure API Management, together with new AI Gateway features and MCP support, provides IT teams with a unified control plane to:

- Protect sensitive data
- Enforce access and usage policies
- Manage operational costs across various copilots and multi-model AI workloads

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Introducing API Management & API Center

- Azure API Management and API Center work together to streamline governance for AI-powered applications and tools.
- Both services centralize API registration, access control, and monitoring.

### 2. Customer Case Study: Access Group’s AI Integration via Azure API Gateway

- Real-world example showing how a large enterprise manages AI agent access and workload scalability.

### 3. Model Governance Features

- Central enforcement of:
  - Semantic caching
  - Content safety checks
  - Granular logging policies

### 4. Demonstrating Token Limit Enforcement in API Calls

- Live demo: Limiting API usage via token quotas to control costs and reduce risk.

### 5. Challenges of Unmanaged AI Tools & Need for Governance

- Risks posed by uncontrolled agent proliferation in enterprise environments.
- Importance of centralized, policy-driven governance for safe AI scaling.

### 6. Using AI Gateway to Manage Tool Usage

- Mechanisms for mediating and monitoring tool interactions.
- Ensuring agents operate within defined enterprise boundaries.

### 7. Multi-Type API Registration & Management in API Center

- Efficiently onboard and classify APIs for different AI workloads, copilots, and models.

### 8. Integration with Microsoft Foundry & AI Gateway Demo

- How API Center and AI Gateway integrate with other Azure services to deliver end-to-end governance and scalability.

### 9. Live Agent Testing

- Demonstration of agent lifecycle management using sample requests and system feedback.

## Key Takeaways

- **Azure API Management and AI Gateway** serve as the backbone of enterprise-grade AI adoption.
- **Policy enforcement and governance** protect data and manage costs while ensuring discoverability of services.
- **Centralized monitoring** enables IT to confidently scale safe AI workloads.
