# How to Get the Most Out of Your AI with Vibe Coding

In this video, GitHub demonstrates the concept of "vibe coding"—the practice of letting AI tools such as GitHub Copilot help build your product. A key message is that providing the right context enables better results, regardless of your technical background.

## Key Topics Covered

- **What is Vibe Coding?**
  - Using AI to generate code for your projects based on the information you provide.
  - "Vibe coding" isn't just about letting the AI run wild; it's about guiding it effectively.

- **Importance of Product Requirements Documents (PRD)**
  - Contrary to popular belief, a PRD isn't too technical—even non-engineers can produce useful requirements.
  - A well-written PRD gives your AI assistant a strong foundation to understand your goals and constraints, improving the relevance and accuracy of generated code.

- **Practical Tips**
  - Take the time to explicitly describe your product's functionality and limitations.
  - Use clear, detailed requirements—these help Copilot and similar tools produce more accurate code.
  - Even if you're not an experienced developer, you can participate in the software creation process by providing structured input.
