# Inside the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund: Leveling Up OSS Security

**Hosted by GitHub, with guest host Greg Cochran**

In this episode of The GitHub Podcast, four open-source maintainers—Christian (Log4j/Log4Shell), Carlos (GoReleaser), Michael (EVCC), and Camila (ScanAPI)—discuss practical experiences in improving security for foundational open source projects, as supported by the [GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.com/open-source/github-secure-open-source-fund).

## Highlights

- **Three-week Security Sprints**: Maintainers share their experiences with guided security improvement sprints, including practices like:
  - Hardening GitHub Actions pipelines
  - Developing incident response plans
  - Enhancing reporting processes
  - Generating SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) that cover dependency licenses

- **Community Collaboration**: They emphasize the impact of a tight-knit security community, collaborative learning (even asking "dumb" questions in a safe space), and a ripple effect that improves dependencies across OSS projects.

- **AI-enabled Security**:
  - Discussing AI's role in security, the group covers:
    - Using fuzzing and automated tools to discover vulnerabilities
    - Leveraging [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and games like [Secure Code Game](https://github.com/skills/secure-code-game) for staying ahead of attackers using AI

## Key Topics

- Project improvements driven by the Fund (Log4j remediation, incident planning)
- Power of community support for maintainers
- Tangible steps for securing open source infrastructure with GitHub-native tools
- The growing importance of AI and Copilot for OSS security workflows
