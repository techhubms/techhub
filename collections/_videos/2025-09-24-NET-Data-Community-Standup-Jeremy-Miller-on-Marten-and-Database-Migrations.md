# .NET Data Community Standup: Jeremy Miller on Marten and Database Migrations

**Featuring:** Jiri Cincura, Shay Rojansky, Jeremy Miller

## Overview

In this community standup, Jeremy Miller—the creator of the Marten library—shares his knowledge and practical experience around database migrations in .NET development. The session includes discussions about the evolving features of Marten, migration strategies for developers, and how traditional ORMs like Entity Framework Core compare to Marten in modern .NET architectures.

## Key Topics

- **Marten Library:** A PostgreSQL-based .NET data access library with advanced migration and event sourcing features.
- **Database Migrations:** Techniques, best practices, and tooling involved in managing schema changes in production .NET applications.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core) vs. Marten:** Strengths, differences, and application scenarios for each ORM/tool.
- **Data Architecture Trends:** Evolving patterns in .NET data persistence and how developers can leverage Marten for new solutions.
- **Community Q&A:** Jeremy and the team answer developer questions related to migration pitfalls, performance, and data modeling.

## Who Should Watch

- .NET developers interested in alternative data access tools
- Teams dealing with data migrations and complex schema evolution
- Architects evaluating PostgreSQL solutions for .NET
