# Sentinel Alert to Autonomous Action: Controlled AI Response Framework

Learn how to accelerate incident response in Microsoft Sentinel with an AI-powered automation framework presented at Microsoft Ignite.

## Key Topics

- **Blink Platform Capabilities:** Demonstration of Builder Copilot and Analyst Copilot for building and managing security automation.
- **Workflow Editor:** Tips on using Blink's integrated tools to design reusable workflows.
- **Alert Verification:** How Sentinel sends alerts to Microsoft Teams and how AI agents verify responses.
- **AI Agents vs LLMs:** Exploring the differences between Large Language Models and specialized AI agents for security operations.
- **Agent Responsibilities:** Using AI agents to investigate Sentinel alerts, including hands-on KQL query examples for advanced threat hunting.
- **Controlled Automation:** Frameworks for fast, safe, and environment-specific security remediation.

## Workflow Highlights

- Automate workflow creation and response steps with Builder Copilot
- Use Analyst Copilot for investigation and validation
- Integrate alert messaging with Microsoft Teams
- Configure custom micro agents to trigger, investigate, and resolve incidents
