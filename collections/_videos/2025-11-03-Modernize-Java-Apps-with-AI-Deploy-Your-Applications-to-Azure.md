# Modernize Java Apps with AI: Deploy Your Applications to Azure

**Host:** Ayan Gupta, Microsoft Developer

## Overview

This session demonstrates the full process of deploying a modernized Java application to Microsoft Azure, leveraging the GitHub Copilot App Modernization tool for an AI-powered, streamlined cloud deployment experience.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Project Recap:** The journey begins with an upgraded Asset Manager application, previously modernized and migrated in earlier sessions.
- **The Deployment Challenge:** Traditional cloud deployments involve manual infrastructure provisioning, writing and managing complex YAML CI/CD workflows, and integrating Azure resources—a process that is often error-prone and time-consuming.
- **Copilot-Powered Deployment:** The App Modernization tool uses GitHub Copilot's AI to deeply analyze your application's architecture, automatically generate architecture diagrams, collaborate on a deployment plan, and provision necessary Azure resources via the Azure Developer CLI (azd).
- **Iterative, Automated Approach:** The tool supports iterative deployments, learning from issues, retrying steps as needed, and ultimately reducing the complexities associated with cloud migrations.

## Deployment Workflow Highlights

1. **Architecture Diagram Generation:** Copilot scans the application and produces an architecture overview diagram for review.
2. **Deployment Plan Creation:** An AI-generated plan covers what needs to be provisioned and deployed on Azure.
3. **Azure Resource Provisioning:** Azure resources (e.g., App Service, Azure SQL) are automatically provisioned using the Azure Developer CLI.
4. **Automated CI/CD Configuration:** YAML files and pipelines are managed by the tool, minimizing manual overhead.
5. **Deployment and Testing:** The App Modernization tool deploys the app to Azure, handles retries, adapts to issues, and lets you verify the running application through the Azure Portal.

## What You'll Learn

- How to harness AI tools to accelerate cloud migration of Java workloads
- The end-to-end workflow for cloud deployment using GitHub Copilot's App Modernization tool
- Automating infrastructure provisioning with Azure Developer CLI (azd)
- Streamlining CI/CD for application delivery
- Verifying and testing deployments in the Azure Portal
