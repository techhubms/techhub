# Scalable ExpressRoute Gateway: New SKU Deep Dive

**Author:** John Savill's Technical Training

## Introduction

This video provides a technical overview of Microsoft's new scalable ExpressRoute Gateway SKU for Azure. The session introduces gateway basics, examines available SKUs, explains fixed throughput and scaling mechanisms, and covers practical aspects such as pricing and migration.

## Chapters Covered

- Gateway fundamentals
- ExpressRoute Gateway SKUs
- Gateway functions and fixed throughput
- New scalable gateway SKU
- Scale units (min/max)
- Fixed and auto scaling capabilities
- Pricing and cost considerations
- Migration and transition guidance
- Future roadmap for ExpressRoute Gateways

## Key Takeaways

- **ExpressRoute Gateway Basics:** Understand the function of Azure's ExpressRoute Gateways as part of hybrid or enterprise networking, allowing private connectivity between on-premises infrastructure and Azure.
