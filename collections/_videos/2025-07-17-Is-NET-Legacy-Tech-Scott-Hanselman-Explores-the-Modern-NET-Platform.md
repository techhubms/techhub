## Is .NET Legacy Tech?

In this episode of #OneDevQuestion, Scott Hanselman addresses a common question in the development community: "Is .NET legacy tech?"

### The Dual Nature of .NET

Hanselman explains that .NET prides itself on a long and rich history. Like languages such as C or C++, .NET’s maturity comes from years of development, a robust ecosystem, and broad industry adoption. This legacy provides developers with stability, familiarity, and trust.

However, Hanselman is quick to point out that modern .NET shouldn’t be seen as outdated. With .NET 9 and recent advancements, the platform remains:

- **Open-source:** Regularly updated with community and Microsoft contributions.
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, with support for a variety of devices and environments.
- **Versatile:** Powers applications on everything from Raspberry Pi to Xbox.

### Continuous Innovation

The .NET team continues to evolve the platform, keeping it relevant for new scenarios and workloads. This ongoing innovation ensures that developers have access to state-of-the-art tools and libraries, while also benefiting from the foundation of a well-established technology.

### Conclusion

Scott Hanselman concludes that .NET is both a mature, stable, "legacy" technology—and a modern, evolving platform ready for the future of development.
