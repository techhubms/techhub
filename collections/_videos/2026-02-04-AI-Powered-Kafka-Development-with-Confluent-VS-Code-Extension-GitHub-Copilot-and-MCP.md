# AI-Powered Kafka Development: Confluent Extension + GitHub Copilot + MCP

**Presenters:** Reynald Adolphe (@ReynaldAdolphe), Viktor Gamov (@gamussa)

Apache Kafka is central to many modern data streaming applications, but its complexity can be a barrier to new and experienced developers alike. In this session, you'll learn how to leverage AI-powered tools within Visual Studio Code to simplify Kafka development.

## Key Topics

- **Challenges in Kafka Development:**
  - Navigating distributed systems concepts
  - Code bootstrapping
  - Managing schemas and validating schema evolution
  - Debugging Kafka message flows

- **Toolchain Overview:**
  - **Confluent VS Code Extension:** Adds Kafka-awareness directly into the IDE for seamless schema and topic metadata access.
  - **GitHub Copilot:** Acts as an AI assistant offering code suggestions and guidance tailored to the Kafka context, boosting developer productivity.
  - **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Bridges the gap between AI assistants and platform context, enabling schema registry visibility and smarter code generation.

## Live Demonstration

- Setting up the environment in Visual Studio Code
- Using the Confluent Extension for direct Kafka integration
- Generating Kafka-related code with GitHub Copilot
- Supplying context to Copilot via MCP for accurate schema and topic management
- Intelligent schema validation and interactive troubleshooting

## Outcomes

- Minimize the Kafka learning curve through AI-assisted tooling
- Achieve interactive development with less reliance on external documentation
- Accelerate workflow with code generation tailored to real Kafka configurations
