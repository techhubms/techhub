# Azure Local and Atos: Migrating Internal Services from VMware

## Introduction

Atos faced a challenge: several services needed to remain on-premises, but many VMware clusters were reaching end-of-life. A solution was needed to maintain reliably managed internal IT infrastructure and to modernize operations efficiently.

## Why Azure Local Was Chosen

- Atos evaluated multiple options and found Azure Local offered the best combination of compatibility, cost-saving, and scalability.
- Azure Local’s hybrid capabilities made it possible to maintain on-prem resources while enabling cloud innovation.

## Migration Process and Timeline

- Decisions and technical steps for rapid migration were critical due to tight deadlines.
- Migration included:
  - Hardware procurement and validation for network readiness.
  - Implementation of all-NVMe Storage Spaces Direct for improved performance.
  - Stepwise transition of workloads to Azure Local, ensuring continuity of internal services.

## Operational and Technical Advancements

- Adoption of Azure Arc allowed Atos to modernize database operations, specifically for SQL and PostgreSQL workloads.
- Licensing flexibility through Azure Arc permitted future-proofing of deployments.
- New operational models were evaluated and introduced as a result of the migration.

## Benefits Delivered

- Significant cost savings over legacy VMware clusters.
- Enhanced internal capabilities and service delivery speed.
- Future-proof technical groundwork using Azure Local and Azure Arc for hybrid management.

## Key Technologies and Concepts

- Azure Local: Hybrid cloud extension for on-prem infrastructure.
- Azure Arc: Provides unified management for databases and servers across environments.
- Storage Spaces Direct: NVMe-enabled storage framework for high performance.

## Conclusion

Atos’s customer zero story is a practical example of modernizing legacy infrastructure with Microsoft’s hybrid solutions. Their experience demonstrates accelerated migration timelines, improved service reliability, and strategic use of Azure Local and Azure Arc.
