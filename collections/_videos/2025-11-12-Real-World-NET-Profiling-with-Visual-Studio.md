# Real-World .NET Profiling with Visual Studio

Presented by Nik

## Session Overview

In this session, Nik takes participants beyond the basics of performance profiling by demonstrating real-world workflows for optimizing open source .NET libraries. The focus is on actionable profiling techniques and tools to improve application performance.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Visual Studio Profiler**: Running CPU and .NET Allocation traces to identify bottlenecks and memory issues.
- **BenchmarkDotNet**: Incorporating this tool for structured benchmarking to assess and compare code performance changes.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Using AI-assisted code suggestions to refactor and optimize code for better performance.
- **Workflow Integration**: Combining profiler insights with benchmarking and Copilot-generated improvements.

## Practical Techniques

- Setting up and interpreting performance traces in Visual Studio.
- Using profiler data to target and optimize slow or inefficient code paths.
- Writing and executing benchmarks with BenchmarkDotNet.
- Leveraging GitHub Copilot to generate code suggestions and quickly experiment with optimizations.

## Who Should Watch

- Developers contributing to open source .NET projects.
- Engineers looking to sharpen their profiling and optimization skills.
- Anyone building high-performance applications using .NET, C#, or related Microsoft technologies.
