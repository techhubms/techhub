## Passkey 101

Passkeys are modern authentication credentials that combine security with convenience. They can be bound to a specific device for extra security or synced across multiple devices via the cloud.

### Device Bound Passkeys

- Stored and used exclusively on a single device
- Useful for additional security where device control is critical

### Synced Passkeys

- Stored in the cloud, accessible from multiple devices
- Improve mobility and user flexibility
- Integration with Microsoft Entra ID provides enterprise-grade identity protections within Azure

---

## Passkey Policies

- Azure admin can enforce policies dictating how passkeys are used and managed across the environment
- Policy options include requiring device-bound passkeys, allowing cloud-synced passkeys, and setting user access rules

---

## User Choice

- Users may choose which passkey configuration suits their operational requirements
- Azure identity management features enable tailored approaches for each user or group based on policy

---

## Practical Guidance

- For step-by-step visuals, see the [Whiteboard Diagram](https://github.com/johnthebrit/RandomStuff/raw/master/Whiteboards/SyncedPasskeys.jpg)
