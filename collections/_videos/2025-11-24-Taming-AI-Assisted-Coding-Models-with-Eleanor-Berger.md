# Taming AI Assisted Coding Models with Eleanor Berger

Pamela and Eleanor Berger dive into the art of AI-assisted coding, focusing on practical strategies and hands-on workflows for developers using Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Delegating to Agentic Models:**
  - The rationale for offloading coding tasks to background AI agents and how this changes daily development.
  - Overview of different agent tooling including the agents.md standard for documenting agent behavior.

- **GitHub Copilot and Actions Integration:**
  - Using Copilot for code completion, chat, and automation within VS Code.
  - GitHub Actions for automating workflows and background tasks.

- **Writing Specs Models Actually Follow:**
  - Techniques for drafting effective specifications that LLMs can interpret accurately.
  - Strategies for working with multiple LLMs (GPT-5, Mini, Grok) and aligning output with developer intent.

- **Sandboxed Evaluations and Guardrails:**
  - Running evaluations in sandboxes to safely test AI-generated code.
  - Implementing guardrails to minimize errors or unintended outcomes.

- **The Ruler Project and Centralized Rules:**
  - Introduction to Eleanor’s open-source Ruler project for managing rules across agentic workflows.
  - Benefits of centralizing AI governance for teams and individual developers.

- **Workflow Innovations:**
  - Designing CLI-first approaches alongside interactive voice controls in VS Code.
  - Managing multiple agents and workflows for complex coding scenarios.

- **Model Face-Offs and Personality Steering:**
  - Comparing the capabilities of different AI models and learning to steer their unique behaviors.

## Practical Advice

- Create richer, more targeted prompts to get better AI code assistance.
- Use agents.md as a standard for documenting and communicating agent behavior within your codebase.
- Test AI-generated code in isolated sandboxes before merging into production.
- Employ centralized governance (like Ruler) to maintain consistency and safety in multi-agent environments.
- Explore voice and CLI tools for diverse interaction modes within VS Code.
