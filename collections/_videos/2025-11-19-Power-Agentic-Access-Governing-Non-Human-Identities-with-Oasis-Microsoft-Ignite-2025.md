# Power Agentic Access: Governing Non-Human Identities with Oasis

**Speaker:** Yonit Glozshtein  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 (Session ODSP1506)

## Overview

Non-human identities—service principals, managed identities, and tokens—play a pivotal role in running AI agents on Microsoft cloud platforms. Without visibility and governance, these entities pose serious security risks like identity sprawl, unchecked privileges, and long-lived secrets.

## Oasis Platform Capabilities

- **Discover Agents:** Automatically scan and inventory every agent operating across Microsoft Entra, Azure, Microsoft 365, and GitHub environments.
- **Rightsize Roles:** Analyze agent intent to grant purpose-based, short-lived access roles that reduce standing privilege.
- **Eliminate Long-Lived Secrets:** Enforce rotation policies and time-to-live (TTL) for secrets, minimizing risk exposure.
- **Automate Lifecycle:** Assign ownership, define access purpose, set expiration (TTL), and gather evidence for audit trails.
- **Centralized Control:** Govern identities and access from a single pane of glass, providing developer agility with security best practices.

## Session Chapters

1. **Centralized Control for Agent Discovery and Lifecycle Management** – Introduction to Oasis platform and its value in consolidating identity governance.
2. **Risks of Uncontrolled Accounts and Identity Sprawl** – Addressing the dangers inherent to unmanaged non-human identities.
3. **Securing AI Adoption at Scale** – How Oasis facilitates secure, scalable AI agent deployment using analyzed intent and controlled access.
4. **Access Controls and Lifecycle Automation** – Showcase of purpose-based, short-lived roles and example scenarios (e.g., access to FMA files).

## Key Takeaways

- Gain visibility into all agent identities across Microsoft cloud services.
- Reduce risk by minimizing standing privileges and automating rotations and audits.
- Maintain developer speed without compromising on governance and compliance.
