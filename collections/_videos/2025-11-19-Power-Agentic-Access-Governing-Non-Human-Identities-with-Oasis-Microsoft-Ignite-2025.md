description: "This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 introduces the Oasis platform, which delivers centralized governance for non-human identities—such as service principals, managed identities, and tokens—used by AI agents. It explains the risks of uncontrolled accounts, showcases agent discovery across Microsoft Entra, Azure, M365, and GitHub, and demonstrates how Oasis automates lifecycle management with role right-sizing, short-lived secrets, and audit evidence."

# Power Agentic Access: Governing Non-Human Identities with Oasis

**Speaker:** Yonit Glozshtein  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 (Session ODSP1506)

## Overview

Non-human identities—service principals, managed identities, and tokens—play a pivotal role in running AI agents on Microsoft cloud platforms. Without visibility and governance, these entities pose serious security risks like identity sprawl, unchecked privileges, and long-lived secrets.

## Oasis Platform Capabilities

- **Discover Agents:** Automatically scan and inventory every agent operating across Microsoft Entra, Azure, Microsoft 365, and GitHub environments.
- **Rightsize Roles:** Analyze agent intent to grant purpose-based, short-lived access roles that reduce standing privilege.
- **Eliminate Long-Lived Secrets:** Enforce rotation policies and time-to-live (TTL) for secrets, minimizing risk exposure.
- **Automate Lifecycle:** Assign ownership, define access purpose, set expiration (TTL), and gather evidence for audit trails.
- **Centralized Control:** Govern identities and access from a single pane of glass, providing developer agility with security best practices.

## Session Chapters

1. **Centralized Control for Agent Discovery and Lifecycle Management** – Introduction to Oasis platform and its value in consolidating identity governance.
2. **Risks of Uncontrolled Accounts and Identity Sprawl** – Addressing the dangers inherent to unmanaged non-human identities.
3. **Securing AI Adoption at Scale** – How Oasis facilitates secure, scalable AI agent deployment using analyzed intent and controlled access.
4. **Access Controls and Lifecycle Automation** – Showcase of purpose-based, short-lived roles and example scenarios (e.g., access to FMA files).

## Key Takeaways

- Gain visibility into all agent identities across Microsoft cloud services.
- Reduce risk by minimizing standing privileges and automating rotations and audits.
- Maintain developer speed without compromising on governance and compliance.
