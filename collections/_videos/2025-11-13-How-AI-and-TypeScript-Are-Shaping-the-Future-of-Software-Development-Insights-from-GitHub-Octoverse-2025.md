## Overview

Idan Gazit reviews key findings from the Octoverse 2025 report and reflects on the changes driving modern software development. The discussion focuses on programming language trends, the expanding impact of AI, and what these changes mean for individual developers and organizations globally.

## Key Points

### TypeScript's Rise

- TypeScript has now surpassed Python and Java in usage among developers on GitHub.
- This shift reflects a broadening adoption of typed and modern JavaScript development, including frontend and backend projects.

### Python in the AI Era

- Despite TypeScript's rise, Python maintains a strong position, especially in AI and machine learning domains.
- Python continues to be the language of choice for data scientists and AI engineers.

### AI’s Broadening Influence

- AI is changing not only how developers write code, but also how they choose programming languages.
- The integration of AI-powered tools is altering workflows—from code suggestion to bug fixing and automated refactoring.

### Language Choice and Niche Languages

- AI's increasing capabilities may further affect both popular and niche language adoption, as developers rely on AI tools to bridge gaps in expertise.
- AI can level the playing field across languages by providing advanced tooling and code translation.

### Emerging Markets and AI Adoption

- AI development and usage are expanding in emerging markets, enabling new opportunities and reducing barriers.
- Companies approach AI integration differently based on their resources and readiness, but adoption is trending upward globally.

## Takeaways

- The software development landscape is rapidly evolving, with AI playing a central role in how code is produced and managed.
- Developers should stay informed about language trends and AI tooling to remain competitive.
- The Octoverse 2025 report highlights important metrics worth reviewing for anyone invested in the future of development.
