# Anders Hejlsberg on the Origins of TypeScript and Fixing JavaScript

In this GitHub interview, Anders Hejlsberg describes the challenge faced by the developer community as JavaScript applications became increasingly large and complex. The discussion focuses on:

- **Industry Realization**: Recognition that JavaScript, in its original form, lacked features and tooling for managing massive codebases.
- **Script# Rejection**: The initial approach to compile C# to JavaScript (Script Sharp) was not widely adopted, as it did not address JavaScript’s core issues for web-scale development.
- **Creation of TypeScript**: The pivotal decision to improve JavaScript itself by providing type safety, better tooling, and scalable language features, leading to the development of TypeScript by Microsoft.

## Key Points

- **Why Fix JavaScript?**: Large-scale applications exposed JavaScript's limitations in maintainability and tooling.
- **Script# Limitations**: The C# to JavaScript compilation model did not become mainstream, highlighting the need for a different solution.
- **TypeScript’s Role**: TypeScript was designed to add static types to JavaScript, enabling scalable development while embracing JavaScript’s ecosystem.
