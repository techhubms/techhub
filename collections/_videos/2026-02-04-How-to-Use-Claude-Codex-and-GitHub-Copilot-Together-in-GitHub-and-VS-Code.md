# How to Use Claude, Codex, and GitHub Copilot Together in GitHub and VS Code

In this video from GitHub, learn how to utilize multiple coding agents—GitHub Copilot, Claude by Anthropic, and OpenAI Codex—within GitHub and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Overview

- **Agents Supported:** GitHub Copilot, Claude (Anthropic), and OpenAI Codex are now available to Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise users.
- **Platforms:** Agents can be run side by side inside GitHub (web), Visual Studio Code, and GitHub Mobile.
- **Unified Workflow:** Review code artifacts, manage issues, and handle pull requests directly within your existing GitHub repositories and tools.

## Key Features

- **Session Management:** Easily manage agent sessions and workflows in VS Code, assign different tasks to each intelligent agent, and review their outputs in context.
- **Task Assignment:** Assign issues within your projects directly to your preferred agent, such as GitHub Copilot, Claude, or Codex, selecting the agent that is best suited for the problem at hand.
- **Artifacts and Integration:** All output and review artifacts are saved in GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests, making traceability and collaboration seamless.
- **Mobile Support:** Manage and interact with AI-powered agents using GitHub Mobile for productivity on the go.

## How It Works

1. **Start a Session:** Launch VS Code or GitHub and choose your agent(s).
2. **Assign Tasks:** As you work, you can allocate specific issues or pull requests to an agent for code generation or review.
3. **Review Outputs:** Artifacts generated by the different agents are automatically attached to the relevant repositories, allowing easy review and collaboration.
