# What is an AI Agent?

**Presented by Seth Juarez**

The term "AI agent" often appears in discussions about modern software development, but its definition can be ambiguous. In this brief video, Seth Juarez from Microsoft provides a clear explanation:

- **AI agents** are new control structures in software that convert natural language instructions into executable code.
- This mechanism enables developers and users to harness the power of artificial intelligence for automation, making tasks easier and more efficient.
- Instead of using traditional programming methods, AI agents facilitate automation directly from plain language prompts, broadening accessibility.
