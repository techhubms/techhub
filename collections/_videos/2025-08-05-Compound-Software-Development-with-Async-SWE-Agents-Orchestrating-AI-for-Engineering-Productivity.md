# Compound Software Development with Async SWE Agents: Orchestrating AI for Engineering Productivity

Join hosts Priyanka Vergadia and Govind Kamtamneni on **Sip and Sync with Azure** as they showcase how the future of software engineering is shifting towards managing fleets of asynchronous AI agents. Instead of replacing developers, Microsoft’s ecosystem aims to 'multiply' their productivity by 100x through strategic AI agent orchestration.

## Key Takeaways

- **Humans as Orchestrators**: Software engineers now focus on high-level coordination—defining workflows, evaluating agent outputs, and overseeing risk—while AI agents execute coding tasks asynchronously.
- **Context Engineering & Verification**: Engineers remain essential for understanding user needs, architecting orchestration workflows, and performing rigorous output checks.

## Live Demo Highlights

- **Research Agent with M365 Copilot Integration**: Demonstrates automatic creation of Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) using contextual information from Microsoft 365 Copilot.
- **GitHub Spark for Rapid Prototyping**: Context-driven prototyping within GitHub workflows to accelerate solution ideation.
- **Agent Platforms – Async Loom & AI Foundry**:
  - [Async Loom](https://asyncloom.com) acts as a command center to deploy, coordinate, and monitor multiple coding agents.
  - [AI Foundry](https://aifoundry.app) and [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com) enable scaling and orchestration of AI coding agents across projects.
- **Agent Monitoring with Microsoft Teams**: Engineers can track agent progress and alerts through Teams while multitasking or away from their workstation.
- **Automated Testing with GitHub Actions**: Integration of automated testing agents into CI/CD pipelines using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/agent-unlock) ensures code reliability.

## Summary

This episode demonstrates how developers armed with Microsoft Azure AI, GitHub Copilot, and orchestration platforms like Async Loom can dramatically increase their impact. The agent-based approach frees humans to focus on product context, workflow design, validation, and risk management, while AI drives speed and scale in software creation.
