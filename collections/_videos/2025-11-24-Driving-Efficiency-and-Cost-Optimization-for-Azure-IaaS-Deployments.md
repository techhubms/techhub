# Driving Efficiency and Cost Optimization for Azure IaaS Deployments

**Speakers:** Yuemin Lu, Rajeesh Ramachandran, Sam Shteingart  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Session Code:** BRK176

## Overview

This session addresses common cost and efficiency challenges in Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and highlights recent Azure enhancements designed to help organizations reduce total cost of ownership (TCO). The speakers share both strategic frameworks and practical product updates, featuring real examples from Morgan Stanley's cloud journey.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Framework for Optimizing Compute, Storage, and Networking**: Comprehensive approaches to architecting cost-efficient cloud environments on Azure.
- **Application Performance Profiling and Power BI Cost Analysis**: Use of Power BI to analyze application performance and break down infrastructure costs by region or component.
- **Real Power BI Data Insights**: Interpretation of cost data and regional comparisons to guide infrastructure decisions.
- **Storage Improvements**: Introduction of storage provisioning advancements, including a 6% reduction in storage cost per GB.
- **Smart Tiering for Azure Blob Storage**: New feature for automatically moving data between storage tiers for optimal cost efficiency.
- **Instant Rehydration**: Enhances Blob Storage by enabling data to instantly move back to the Hot tier when accessed, improving performance for archived or infrequently accessed data.
- **ExpressRoute Scalable Gateway**: Updates allow dynamic scaling up to 40 Gbps, supporting larger and more bandwidth-intensive workloads.
- **Network Monitoring and Cost Optimization**: Implementation of log filtering and new AI tools to improve network observability and reduce monitoring expenses.
