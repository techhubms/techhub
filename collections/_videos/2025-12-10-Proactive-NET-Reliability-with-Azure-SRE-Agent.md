# Proactive .NET Reliability with Azure SRE Agent

In this demo-focused session, dotnet showcases modern strategies for enhancing reliability in ASP.NET Core applications using Azure SRE Agent. The workflow emphasizes getting ahead of incidents—so issues are fixed before end users encounter them.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Instrumentation with Application Insights**: Integrate telemetry into your ASP.NET Core app, enabling actionable monitoring and visibility into performance.
- **Azure SRE Agent Integration**: Deploy the Azure SRE Agent to automatically identify performance regressions and anomalies in real-time.
- **Triage and Root Cause Analysis**: Use SRE Agent's diagnostic capabilities to quickly pinpoint the root cause of incidents, streamlining the remediation process.
- **Automated Safe Rollbacks**: Configure the system to trigger rollbacks when regressions are detected, ensuring operational continuity and minimizing customer impact.
- **Custom Sub-Agent Development**: Extend monitoring by building targeted sub-agents to address unique reliability concerns for your application.
- **Scheduled Health Checks**: Automate periodic health assessments to continually validate app readiness and reliability.
- **Integration with Teams Alerts**: Wire up Microsoft Teams notifications to keep your development and operations team instantly informed of critical issues and resolutions.

## Benefits

- Reduced incident rates and minimized customer pain
- Accelerated deployment velocity with confidence in app reliability
- Actionable insights from seamless telemetry and incident management
