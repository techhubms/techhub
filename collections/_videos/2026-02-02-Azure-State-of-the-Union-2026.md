# Azure State of the Union 2026

## Introduction

Join John Savill for a comprehensive look at the current landscape of Microsoft Azure in 2026. This video covers critical topics for both new and experienced Azure practitioners.

## Key Topics Covered

### Capacity & Resource Management

- Understand Azure's resource allocation, how to manage capacity, and optimize deployments for cost and efficiency.

### Types of Service

- Overview of available Azure compute options, including VM types, scaling choices, consumption models, and specialized services.

### Scaling and Consumption

- Best practices for scaling workloads, using Azure environments, and strategies for effective scaling in multi-region scenarios.

### Geographic Regions & Availability

- Insights into Azure's global regions, Availability Zones, proximity placement groups, and how to ensure high availability and resiliency.

### Governance

- Deep dive into governance practices:
