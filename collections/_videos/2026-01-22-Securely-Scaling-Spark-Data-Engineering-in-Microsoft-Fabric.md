# Securely Scaling Spark Data Engineering in Microsoft Fabric

**Presenters:** Anna Hoffman and Santhosh Kumar Ravindran  
**Channel:** Data Exposed

## Overview

Security and performance are essential considerations for modern data engineering. This episode explores how to securely connect Apache Spark to on-premises and private data sources in Microsoft Fabric and optimize Spark workloads for both cost and speed.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Securing Spark Connectivity with Managed Private Endpoints

- Use **Managed Private Endpoints** in Microsoft Fabric to establish secure connections between Spark and private/on-premises data sources.
- **Private Link** service connectivity enables traffic to flow privately—eliminating exposure to the public internet.
- Enforce strict **inbound and outbound network restrictions** for robust security.

---

### 2. Cost Optimization with Autoscale Billing

- **Autoscale billing** for Spark lets workloads scale flexibly and pay only for what you use.
- Ideal for spiky or unpredictable workloads that need efficient resource allocation.

---

### 3. Performance Boost: Native Execution Engine

- Unlock up to **4x faster performance** for Spark workloads using the **Native Execution Engine** in Microsoft Fabric.
- Achieve these gains without any code modifications.
- Data engineers benefit from improved speed at no additional cost.
