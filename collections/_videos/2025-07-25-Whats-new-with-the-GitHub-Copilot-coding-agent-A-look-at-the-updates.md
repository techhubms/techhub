## Summary of the Video

In this GitHub video, the team outlines several significant improvements introduced to the GitHub Copilot coding agent as of June. The upgrades are targeted at increasing efficiency, accessibility, and transparency for professional developers and teams.

### Key Improvements

- **Extended Access:**
  - The Copilot coding agent is now available to both Copilot Business and Copilot Pro users. This widened availability means more teams can leverage advanced AI-powered coding assistance for a variety of use cases—from clearing backlogs to accelerating new project starts.

- **Session Tracking:**
  - Users can now review their recent coding agent sessions via the dedicated agents page. This feature allows for better session management and easier reference to previous work, enhancing workflow continuity and auditability.

- **Playwright MCP Integration:**
  - The agent now leverages Playwright MCP by default. This integration enables automated validation of UI changes and posts screenshots of updates within coding sessions. Such capabilities assist in maintaining UI consistency and speeding up review cycles.

- **Remote MCP Server Support:**
  - With support for remote MCP servers, teams can centralize their validation infrastructure, optimize resources, and manage distributed workflows more effectively.

### Practical Benefits

- Increased accessibility and usability for organizations with different Copilot subscription levels.
- Improved debugging, testing, and review of UI changes through integrated screenshot validation.
- Centralized tracking and history of agent activities, streamlining management for teams and individuals.

### Additional Resources
