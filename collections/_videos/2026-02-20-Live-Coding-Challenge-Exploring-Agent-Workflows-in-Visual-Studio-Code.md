# Live Coding Challenge: Exploring Agent Workflows in Visual Studio Code

In this engaging live coding session, Burke Holland and Pierce Boggan compete against each other to complete a timed programming challenge, each utilizing agent workflows in Visual Studio Code. The session showcases different strategies for leveraging agents to solve development tasks effectively.

After the head-to-head competition, Olivia Guzzardo McVicker joins the discussion to help analyze the results. Together, the trio explores what approaches worked best, which methods proved less effective, and provides recommendations for developers looking to integrate agent workflows into their own projects.

Key takeaways include:

- Practical demonstration of agent-based workflows within VS Code
- Insights on problem-solving strategies and decision-making under time constraints
- Lessons learned, common pitfalls, and tips for getting started with agents in coding environments

Whether you're curious about advanced features in Visual Studio Code or want to see real-time coding strategies, this session is packed with actionable insights for developers.
