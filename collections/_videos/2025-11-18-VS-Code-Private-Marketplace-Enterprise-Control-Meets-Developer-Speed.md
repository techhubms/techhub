# VS Code Private Marketplace: Enterprise Control Meets Developer Speed

Visual Studio Code has announced the general availability of Private Marketplace, a new feature enabling organizations to gain enterprise-grade control over their VS Code extension ecosystem.

## What Is VS Code Private Marketplace?

- Curate custom catalogs of internal extensions.
- Upstream and approve public VS Code extensions for centralized management.
- Enforce security, compliance, and governance policies across development teams.
- Seamless experience for developers with automatic updates and installs.

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Deploy on Azure or any container host**: Flexible hosting options to fit enterprise infrastructure.
- **Sign in with GitHub or Copilot Enterprise subscription**: Support for widely used authentication providers.
- **Install and upstream extensions**: Manage both internal and approved public extensions.
- **Group policy enforcement**: Restrict extension publishing to trusted groups or publishers.
- **Publish updates through CI/CD pipelines**: Streamline releases and updates to extension catalogs.

## Enterprise Benefits

- **Security and Compliance**: Enforce extension usage policies at scale without burdening developers.
- **Governance Controls**: Apply group policies and track publisher trustworthiness.
- **Speed and Productivity**: Enable developer agility—no change to workflows or VS Code user experience.
