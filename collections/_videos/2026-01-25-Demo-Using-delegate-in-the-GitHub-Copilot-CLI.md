# Demo: Using /delegate in the GitHub Copilot CLI

In this GitHub video demonstration, @shanselman walks through the process of using the `/delegate` command in the GitHub Copilot CLI. This command empowers developers to offload heavy computational tasks from their local development environment to the cloud.

## Key Highlights

- **Delegate Computational Tasks**: Offload operations such as application upgrades to a cloud-hosted agent, freeing your local machine for other work.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: While the agent handles resource-intensive workloads, developers can continue productive tasks locally without interrupting their main workflow.
- **Workflow Automation**: The agent can automate upgrading a Next.js app, run tests, and even create pull requests automatically when the upgrade is complete.
- **Feedback Loop**: The agent streams logs back to the developer, providing real-time insight and control.

## Steps Demonstrated

1. Initiate the `/delegate` command in the Copilot CLI to assign a specific coding or upgrade task to an agent.
2. The agent works remotely, handling upgrades, dependency installation, and test execution.
3. Once tasks are done, the agent creates a pull request in the repository.
4. Developers can review the output, review the code changes, and merge or request further modifications as needed.

## Use Cases

- Upgrading dependencies or frameworks (e.g., Next.js) with minimal disruption to your workflow.
- Running resource-intensive tests or builds in the cloud.
- Automated pull request creation for code reviews.

## Additional Information

- The demo highlights how Copilot CLI integrates with existing DevOps practices and tools to streamline software development.
