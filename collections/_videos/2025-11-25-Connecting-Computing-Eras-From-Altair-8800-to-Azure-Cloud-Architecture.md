# Connecting Computing Eras: From Altair 8800 to Azure Cloud Architecture

## Introduction

Join Mark Russinovich and Scott Hanselman for a live, demo-driven session at Microsoft Ignite 2025, bridging historical computing innovation and modern cloud architecture.

## Chapter Highlights

- **Bootloaders Across Eras**: Examines progression from 28-byte boot programs to UEFI and bootloaders powering Azure systems.
- **Abstraction Layers**: Explores the transition from direct machine code to assembler languages, emphasizing the importance of abstraction in scalable systems.
- **Programming Histories**: Mark Russinovich shares his early programming career, including BASIC magazine hex programs and screen dump techniques.
- **Demo: Altair Boots into CP/M**: Live demonstration of booting the Altair emulator, running a classic infinite loop in BASIC, and highlighting errors common in early computing.
- **Tech Community Evolution**: Insights into Sysinternals Newsletter as a pre-social media tech hub for programmers.
- **Open-Sourcing Zork**: Microsoft/Xbox partnership highlights open-source releases of classic games, connecting historic software with modern cloud ecosystems.
- **Modern Terminal Resurgence**: Explains why terminal interfaces are returning in cloud-native development and DevOps workflows.
- **Live Bridge to Altair**: Shows complex, multistep pipelines bridging physical computing devices and modern emulators—illustrating the evolution and inefficiencies of integration.

## Key Themes

- Historical perspective informs current best practices in cloud app architecture
- Lessons from early abstraction, boot processes, and open-source communities shape modern scaling and deployment on Azure
- Embracing the resurgence of terminal interfaces in today’s development workflows

## Practical Takeaways

- Understanding REST APIs' roots in abstraction—from toggle switches to cloud endpoints
- Using historical mistakes and successes to inform error handling, scaling, and developer experience in cloud computing
- Leveraging open-source practices and emulator pipelines for modern app delivery
