# Context Engineering for AI Agents

Understanding and managing context is vital for building reliable and capable AI agents. In this lesson, Microsoft Developer covers:

## What is Context Engineering?

- Context engineering involves identifying and delivering relevant information and resources to AI agents at the right moment.
- This process improves agent reliability and the quality of AI outcomes.

## Types of Context

- Discussion of various forms of context (user input, application state, external knowledge, tools).
- Strategies for determining which information is relevant for different tasks.

## Best Practices in Context Engineering

- Techniques for collecting context: data pipelines, APIs, user interaction.
- Organizing and serving context efficiently to support agent intelligence.
- Lessons learned from common real-world scenarios.

## Code Example

- Practical demonstration is referenced, with code samples provided at [aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners).
- Example likely shows how to implement context management in an AI agent workflow.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- Challenges such as missing or irrelevant context, timing issues, and scalability.
- Solutions include context validation, fallback strategies, and adaptive context retrieval.

## Learn More

- Access the full "AI Agents for Beginners" course and code samples: [https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners](https://aka.ms/ai-agents-beginners)
- Join the discussion and ask questions in Discord: [https://aka.ms/ai-agents/discord](https://aka.ms/ai-agents/discord)

This lesson provides a hands-on introduction to context engineering, helping developers apply best practices and ready-to-use code to build more robust AI solutions.
