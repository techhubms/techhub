# Building Durable Multi-Agent AI Workflows with Dapr Agents

**Presented by Microsoft Developer on Open at Microsoft**

## Overview

This episode explores the new Dapr Durable AI Agent Workflow Framework, focusing on how developers can build, orchestrate, and manage intelligent autonomous agent systems at scale. Dapr Agents leverages CNCF Dapr's distributed application runtime—trusted by enterprises for mission-critical services—to simplify building production-ready agentic solutions.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Introduction to Dapr Agents**: What they are and why agentic systems need advanced orchestration.
- **Building Agentic Systems**: How to combine LLM-driven reasoning, the virtual actor model, pub/sub messaging, and stateful workflows via Dapr Agents.
- **Current State of Agentic Adoption**: Where the industry stands and emerging trends.
- **Running Scalable AI Agents**: Strategies for authentication, infrastructure, and foundational components.
- **Demo**: Step-by-step walkthrough of constructing a Dapr-enabled multi-agent AI workflow.
- **Getting Started and Contributing**: Community involvement and open-source links.

## Demo and Practical Guides

- Live demonstration showing multi-agent workflow implementation with Dapr Agents.
- Example use of state management and actor-based design for resilient agents.
- Integration tips for pub/sub, stateful processes, and handling authentication.
- Focus on intelligent fault-tolerant system design.

## Resources and Next Steps

- [Dapr Agents Project](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents)
- [Dapr Documentation](https://docs.dapr.io)
- [Dapr Community Resources](https://dapr.github.io/dapr-agents/)
- Video resources from MS Build Conference and Linux Foundation
- Community links for contributing and connecting with developers

**Thank you** to contributors like Jorge Arteiro, Yaron Schneider, Roberto Rodriguez, and the Diagrid team.
