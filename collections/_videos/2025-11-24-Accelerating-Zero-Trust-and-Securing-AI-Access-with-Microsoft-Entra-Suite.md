# Accelerating Zero Trust and Securing AI Access with Microsoft Entra Suite

## Overview

This Microsoft Ignite 2025 session discusses how Microsoft Entra Suite supports secure access to AI and agent resources, helping organizations innovate safely. The talk highlights:

- The evolving AI-driven threat landscape and the dual role of AI in both defense and attack.
- How Entra Suite uses identity-driven access controls, adaptive policies, and the AI Gateway to protect every connection.

## Key Topics Covered

### AI-Driven Threat Landscape

- Insight on how AI is transforming both security defenses and attack strategies.

### Dynamic Session Security

- Real-world use case: Protecting users moving between trusted (office) and untrusted (coffee shop) networks using adaptive session controls.

### Unified Zero Trust Policy Engine & Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)

- Explanation of the central enforcement point for access policies.
- Role of CAE in ensuring access remains conditional and responsive to risk signals.

### VPN Migration and Traffic Management

- Practical advice for migrating workloads with split tunnel VPN.
- Building custom traffic databases to handle advanced access requirements.

### Scaling M365 Secure Internet Access

- Strategies for rolling out secure internet access across Microsoft devices at scale.

### Agent Identities

- Introduction to managing non-human accounts, such as service accounts for AI agents, in a secure and auditable manner.

### Access Reviews: Resource vs. User Centric

- Guidance on access review processes for both types of resources.

### Least Privilege and Security Leadership

- Discussion of best practices for implementing least privilege and fostering a strong security leadership culture.

### MCP (Model, Context, Protocol) for AI Agents

- A framework for understanding and evolving AI agent behavior and access control using the MCP model.
