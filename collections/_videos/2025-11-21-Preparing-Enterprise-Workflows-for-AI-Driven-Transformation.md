# Preparing Enterprise Workflows for AI-Driven Transformation

**Speakers:**

- Marco Casalaina (Microsoft)
- Brian Madden (Citrix)

## Session Overview

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 dives deep into how AI is set to evolve the enterprise workplace. The presenters outline a pragmatic roadmap: a seven-stage evolution from today's 'shadow AI' (ad-hoc, sometimes ungoverned AI use) to advanced agent orchestrations where multiple AIs collaborate efficiently alongside humans to drive business processes.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Current and Future AI Roles:** Exploration of how AI currently assists users, what separates hype from practical enterprise adoption, and how AI is moving toward more autonomous involvement.
- **Seven Stages of AI Progression:** Guiding viewers through distinct phases, from early user tools and shadow IT usage to coordinated, multimodal agent orchestration.
- **App Interface Strategies:** Discussion on why enabling AI to utilize existing business applications is often more impactful (and achievable) than waiting for ‘AI-native’ applications to become widespread.
- **Demo Example:** A showcase of Anthropic’s Claude model autonomously generating a PowerPoint deck using HTML-to-PPT conversion, highlighting new patterns of application abstraction.
- **Preparing for Change:** Actionable steps for companies to harness AI’s benefits today (even with current app stacks) and foster a culture that adapts to these disruptive technologies without holding back innovation.

## Practical Recommendations

- Focus on integrating AI with current app architectures via user interfaces and automation tools.
- Monitor developments in agent orchestration and prepare strategies to handle increased AI autonomy.
- Encourage experimentation in controlled environments to balance innovation with risk management.
