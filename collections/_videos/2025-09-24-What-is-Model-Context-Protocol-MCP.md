# What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

**Presented by Damian Brady, Microsoft Developer**

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard designed to enhance the capabilities of AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot. While many developers are familiar with AI tools that suggest code, MCP is about allowing these tools to take real actions—like executing workflows or making changes to software systems—securely and in context.

## Why Does MCP Matter?

- **Beyond Suggestions**: MCP extends the utility of AI assistants by letting them invoke operations on your behalf.
- **Developer Productivity**: Tasks like merging pull requests, running automated tests, or managing CI/CD pipelines could potentially be actioned directly from an AI tool, streamlining developer workflows.
- **Safe Context**: MCP introduces standards for permissions, security, and context-awareness, so developers can trust AI to take appropriate actions.

## How MCP Works

- **Context Exchange**: MCP establishes a standardized way to describe the environment, tools, and permissions available to both the developer and the AI assistant.
- **Enabling Action**: With this protocol, AI assistants can request specific operations (e.g., “create a pull request for this branch”), and the protocol ensures the right context and security policies are enforced.

## Impact for Developers

- **More than Code Generation**: Tools like GitHub Copilot can use MCP to automate routine tasks safely.
- **Extensible Workflows**: Potential integration with development pipelines, issue management, and beyond.
- **Secure Collaboration**: MCP helps prevent unauthorized actions—only permitted operations are allowed.

## Conclusion

Understanding MCP is crucial as AI tools evolve beyond simple code suggestions. By making developer collaboration with AI assistants more secure and productive, MCP paves the way for the next generation of developer automation.
