# Performing CI/CD for SQL Databases in Fabric Using Azure DevOps

This episode of **Data Exposed: MVP Edition** covers how to use Azure DevOps to facilitate continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for SQL databases in Microsoft Fabric, particularly when deploying databases separately from other Fabric items.

## Introduction

Many real-world projects require isolating SQL database deployments from other assets within Fabric. This episode highlights two strategies for achieving that using modern DevOps workflows.

## Topics Covered

- **Understanding CI/CD for SQL Databases in Fabric**: Key concepts for versioning and deploying SQL projects independently.
- **Demo Walkthroughs**: Several demos illustrate two approaches to automated deployment using Azure DevOps.
