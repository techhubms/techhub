# Modernizing DNS/DHCP: Micetro Across Hybrid and Cloud Environments

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025, presented by Scott Penney, explores modern techniques and tools for improving DNS and DHCP management over hybrid and cloud infrastructures.

## Key Topics

- **Centralized IP Address Management (IPAM):** Addressing the need for a unified view and control over network address resources across cloud and on-premises environments.
- **Centralized and Secure API Gateway:** Introduction to API gateways for integrating third-party solutions (e.g., ServiceNow) and optimizing workflows.
- **Intelligent NetOps Integration:** Combining flow and packet analytics with DNS telemetry for improved observability and faster mean time to resolution (MTTR).
- **Active Directory Integration:** Reviewing practical configuration for real scenarios like Active Directory site management.
- **Edge Solutions & Advanced Resolvers:** Discusses how these components can enhance network optimization and reliability, reducing user-impacting outages.

## Practical Benefits

- **Faster DNS Issue Detection:** Integrated telemetry and analytics simplify troubleshooting for network teams.
- **Proactive Management:** Automation and assurance features help address issues before users are affected.
- **API Integration:** Streamlined third-party workflows expand the capability of your NetOps and DDI teams.
