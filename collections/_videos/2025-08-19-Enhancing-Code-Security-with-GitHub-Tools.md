# Enhancing Code Security with GitHub Tools

GitHub provides a range of security-focused features that help developers identify and resolve vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle. This video highlights the key tools available on the GitHub platform:

## Developer-First Security Tools

- **CodeQL**: A static analysis engine that scans repositories for code vulnerabilities and helps developers catch issues at the source.
- **Copilot Autofix**: An AI-powered tool that suggests and applies one-click fixes for security vulnerabilities detected in the codebase.
- **Security Campaigns**: Organized initiatives to manage and reduce technical security debt across projects, improving overall software resilience.
- **Dependency Review**: A feature that notifies developers about risky dependencies and changes in open source packages, allowing informed decisions during pull requests.

## Integrated Security in the Developer Workflow

GitHub's security solutions are designed to empower developers to address vulnerabilities directly within their coding environment and CI/CD pipelines, supporting proactive DevSecOps adoption.
