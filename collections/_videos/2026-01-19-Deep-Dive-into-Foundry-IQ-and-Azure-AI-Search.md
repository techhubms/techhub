# Deep Dive into Foundry IQ and Azure AI Search

**Author:** John Savill's Technical Training

## Overview

This session covers Microsoft Foundry IQ with a focus on:

- How Foundry IQ leverages modern AI models and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Integration with Azure AI Search
- Management of multiple, remote, and new types of knowledge sources
- Agentic RAG and reasoning architecture
- Limits (SKUs, resource quotas, collections)
