# Migrating VMware Workloads to Azure: Tools, Best Practices, and Cloud Management

## Overview

This advanced session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 targets VMware administrators seeking to accelerate their cloud journey. Key topics include:

- **Hybrid Cloud as a Strategy**: Approaching migration with hybrid options for flexibility and scalability.
- **Design, Testing, and Validation**: Planning for smooth transitions with best practices in design and validation.
- **Azure Migrate Capabilities**: Understanding Azure Migrate’s features for discovering, assessing, and migrating VMware workloads to Azure.
- **Operational Comparison**: Exploring differences in provisioning VMs, setting up high availability, and monitoring health in vSphere versus Azure environments.
- **Network and Process Insights**: Analyzing network connections and process-level details during migration.
- **Application Boundaries**: Using Azure Migrate to define and tag applications for better workload management.
- **End-to-End Migration Tool**: Leveraging Azure Migrate as a comprehensive solution for migration, management, and modernization.

## Hybrid and Secure Management

- **Managing Azure IaaS VMs**: Secure operations including demos for configuring and managing VMs.
- **Windows Admin Center**: Installing and operating Windows Admin Center without exposing resources to public IPs.

## Modernization
