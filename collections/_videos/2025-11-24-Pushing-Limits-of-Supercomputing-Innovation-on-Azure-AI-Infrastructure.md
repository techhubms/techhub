# Pushing Limits of Supercomputing Innovation on Azure AI Infrastructure

## Overview

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 explores the technical validation process underpinning Azure's AI infrastructure. Focusing on large GPU clusters, the talk covers:

- **History of model evolution** (2019 to present)
- **Fundamental AI infrastructure stack:**
  - Compute, network, storage, managed services
- **GPU Generations:**
  - GB200/GB300 vs H100 workloads
- **Data ingestion at scale** in Azure Cloud
- **Performance growth & scale:**
  - Azure's track record in production-scale supercomputing
- **Validation processes:**
  - Early detection of bottlenecks in GPU performance, large model throughput
- **Large-scale validation:**
  - GRAC 314B Model case study

## Key Takeaways

- Azure enables efficient training for multi-billion parameter models
