# Driving Agentic Innovation with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for Tool-Aware AI

**Speakers:** Maria Naggaga, Don Scott  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025, BRK194  
**Level:** Intermediate (200)

## Overview

This technical deep-dive showcases how Microsoft’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) acts as a robust communication backbone for tool-aware AI agents. As agents evolve into autonomous collaborators across diverse environments, MCP offers:

- **Secure, scalable, OS-agnostic orchestration**
- **Unified integration across platforms:**
  - Microsoft Foundry
  - GitHub
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- **Support for cloud and on-premises API management**

## Key Chapters

- **Reimagining Tool-Aware AI Systems:** Exploring MCP’s role in Microsoft Foundry ([0:00])
- **Agent Integration & Governance:** Addressing integration challenges and the need for unified access ([00:05:33])
- **Automating Tasks with Agents:** Attaching markdown files to agent modes ([00:11:12])
- **Foundry Tools Unified Catalog:** Announcing 1,400+ connectors for tool orchestration ([00:13:37])
- **Agent 365 Integration:** Extending tool-aware agents to Microsoft 365 apps ([00:14:51])
- **Azure Registries:** Introduction and technical background ([00:22:47])
- **Emergence of MCP Servers:** Managing MCP registries ([00:23:06])
- **ServiceNow Integration:** MCP’s role in third-party service orchestration ([00:32:07])
- **Cross-Cloud & On-Premises API Management:** Ensuring broad compatibility ([00:35:12])
