# What is GitHub Models?

Presented by Damian Brady | Microsoft Developer

GitHub Models is a platform that empowers developers to evaluate, compare, and select from over 40 AI models specifically for code-related tasks. Rather than guessing which model might fit your coding needs, you can test them against your own prompts—and see which one gives the best results.

## Key Features

- **Model Comparison:** Easily compare responses from more than 40 AI models side-by-side.
- **Prompt Evaluation:** Test your own prompts to see which model provides the most relevant or useful output for your development workflow.
- **Time Savings:** Eliminate the trial-and-error guesswork of picking an AI model for code generation, completion, or refactoring.

## How It Works

1. **Pick a Task** – Decide what you want to accomplish (e.g., code completion, code generation, answering a code question).
2. **Enter Your Prompt** – Provide a sample coding prompt or scenario for the models to tackle.
3. **Evaluate Responses** – Review how each model performs on your prompt.

With GitHub Models, you directly see which large language models excel (or struggle) in your scenario—whether you’re working in Python, C#, JavaScript, or other languages.

## Why Use GitHub Models?

- Avoids making blind decisions about which model to integrate.
- Empowers data-driven selection for AI-powered development tools.
- Opens the door to customized coding workflows powered by the best available AI models.
