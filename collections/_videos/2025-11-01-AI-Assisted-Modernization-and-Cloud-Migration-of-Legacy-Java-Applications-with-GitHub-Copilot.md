# AI-Assisted Modernization and Cloud Migration of Legacy Java Applications with GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

Ayan Gupta demonstrates the impact of AI-driven tools—particularly GitHub Copilot's App Modernization feature—on upgrading, securing, and migrating legacy Java applications. The session uses the Asset Manager app (Java 7, AWS S3, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Spring Boot) to showcase a real-world modernization and migration workflow.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Modernization Challenge**: Legacy Java apps traditionally require weeks or months to upgrade—manual review, code changes, dependency updates, and error fixing are time-consuming.
- **GitHub Copilot App Modernization Tool**:
  - **Agent Mode** automates project analysis, identifies upgrade and security issues, and proposes fix plans using OpenRewrite recipes.
  - **Upgrade Execution**: Handles deprecated dependencies, updates frameworks, and resolves security vulnerabilities.
  - **Security Validation**: Automated CVE scanning ensures vulnerabilities are detected and remediated early.
  - **Fix-and-Test Loops**: Automated iterative cycles to resolve build errors and verify application functionality.
- **Cloud Migration**: The tool flags cloud readiness, enabling seamless migration from AWS (S3, database, messaging) to Azure equivalents.
  - Example migration steps: Database migration (PostgreSQL from AWS to Azure), configuration updates, and review of tailored migration plans.
- **Guided Workflow**: Users receive a step-by-step modernization plan, assessment reports, upgrade summaries, and migration execution guides.

## Demo Highlights

- Running automated assessment and upgrade reports
- Reviewing and addressing Java upgrade issues
- Fixing deprecated dependencies and frameworks
- Security scanning and remediation
- Identifying and resolving cloud readiness gaps
- Executing cloud migration from AWS services to Azure
