# Building a Color Palette App Using GitHub Copilot SDK

**Author:** GitHub featuring Cassidy Williams

In this video, Cassidy Williams builds a dedicated color palette manager app, addressing a long-standing need for a more efficient way to organize color schemes beyond using text files. The process, taking less than an hour, demonstrates the power of the GitHub Copilot SDK and its Plan Mode in streamlining app development.

**Key topics covered:**

- **Planning & Scoping:** How Plan Mode helps in outlining app functionality.
- **App Development:** Step-by-step coding using GitHub Copilot SDK to build the core features of a color palette manager.
- **AI-Assisted Debugging:** Leveraging Copilot's suggestions to debug and enhance the app in real time.
- **Image Color Extraction:** Implementing an AI-driven feature to automatically extract color values from uploaded images, expanding the app's functionality rapidly.
- **Demo & Results:** The finished palette manager is shown, highlighting both the coding workflow and the user experience.

The video serves as a practical example for developers interested in accelerating their app building process with AI and illustrates how Copilot's SDK can be integrated into real coding projects.
