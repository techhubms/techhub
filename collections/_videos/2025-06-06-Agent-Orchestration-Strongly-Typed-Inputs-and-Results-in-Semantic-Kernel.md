# Agent Orchestration: Strongly-Typed Inputs and Results in Semantic Kernel

In this video, Learn Microsoft AI demonstrates how to build robust AI agent workflows using strongly-typed input and output models in Semantic Kernel. The session focuses on defining structured input classes and employing type-safe orchestration strategies to enhance the efficiency and maintainability of AI solutions.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Strongly-Typed Input and Output Models:**
  - How to define structured input classes and pass complex data into orchestrations in a type-safe manner
  - Methods for returning structured outputs using custom classes for meaningful result processing

- **Custom Data Transformation in Agent Orchestration:**
  - Where and how to apply `InputTransform` and `ResultTransform` for custom handling of data
  - Improving modularity, scalability, and reliability in AI agent system design

## Benefits of This Approach

- Type safety in orchestration code for easier maintenance and reduced errors
- Modularization of AI agent components for better scalability
- Enhanced application robustness by processing structured, meaningful results rather than plain text

## Resources

- [Semantic Kernel Github Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel)
- [Learn Microsoft AI LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rvinothrajendran/)

Enhance your AI application development workflow by integrating strong typing principles with Semantic Kernel agents.
