# Training and Deploying Reasoning Models with Microsoft Foundry and Azure ML

## Overview

This session guides viewers through the process of training, hosting, and inferring custom reasoning models using [Microsoft Foundry](https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-BestModelGenAISolution) together with Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML). It's designed for an intermediate audience looking to expand their expertise in applying large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning for business-focused AI solutions.

## Key Session Topics

- **Real-World AI Adoption:** Customers are leveraging AI Foundry for tangible ROI, deploying agent-driven applications in multiple industries.
- **From Prototype to Production:** Addresses typical challenges faced when scaling AI models from experimental phases to real business environments.
- **Harnessing LLMs:** Reference to research on using LLMs for actionable business insights, including demonstration of a financial analyst agent.
- **Reinforcement Learning Techniques:**
  - Introduces reinforcement learning for improving model accuracy.
  - Explains both synchronous and asynchronous reinforcement learning methods.
  - Shows how reinforcement learning enables multitask and generalization capabilities in reasoning models.
- **Model Evaluation and Benchmarking:**
  - Demonstrates the evaluation pipeline comparing multiple fine-tuning approaches.
  - Presents benchmarking results on throughput and token latency improvement.
- **Deployment Practices:** Step-by-step demonstration of hosting models for real-time inference and integration into applications via Foundry and Azure ML.
