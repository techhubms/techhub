# GitHub’s Year in Review: Accessibility, MCP, and Tiny Wins

**Hosts:** Cassidy Williams, Abby, and guest Helen Hou-Sandí (GitHub Accessibility Engineering Manager, WordPress lead developer)

## Topics Covered

- **Maintainer Tiny Wins**: Incremental, timeboxed improvements like smarter PR reviewer panels, one-click merge conflict resolution, and WebP support. These changes cumulatively save millions of developer minutes daily and improve user experience at scale.

- **Accessibility Initiatives**: Helen Hou-Sandí shares how small accessibility fixes (e.g., adjusting border colors) can drive larger UX improvements and spark systemic changes, benefiting all users.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The rise of MCP as an open standard for improved context sharing in codebases and across tools.

- **Open Source Tools**: Introduction of GitHub's new open source accessibility scanner GitHub Action, as well as other community-driven solutions like git-history-cleaner and Project Bluefin.

- **Supporting Non-Code Contributors**: Strategies and acknowledgments for those contributing beyond code—documentation, accessibility, and community initiatives.

- **AI and Open Source**: Discussion on the role of AI as a new contributor and how automation and assistive tools impact open source maintenance.
