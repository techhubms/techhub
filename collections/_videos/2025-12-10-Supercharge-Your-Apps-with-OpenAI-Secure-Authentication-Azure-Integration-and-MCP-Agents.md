# Supercharge Your Apps with OpenAI: Secure Authentication, Azure Integration, and MCP Agents

Learn how to harness the full capabilities of AI in your apps using official OpenAI libraries for popular languages such as .NET, Python, JavaScript, Java, and Go. This session provides a practical, in-depth look at how to implement modern, enterprise-ready practices for secure and efficient AI integration.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Understanding OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Foundry Models**  
  Gain clarity on the differences and complementarities of OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Foundry Models. Learn how to choose between them for different enterprise scenarios and how they can be combined for robust AI solutions.

- **Secure Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID**  
  Move beyond traditional API key-based authentication and adopt a token-based approach using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) to achieve compliance and scalability. This ensures your AI integrations meet enterprise security standards and can safely scale across your organization.

- **Integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP)**  
  Discover how to call MCP tools directly from OpenAI libraries, allowing your agentic applications to interact with external tools and data sources. This opens up new opportunities for building intelligent assistants, workflow automations, and enhanced user experiences.

## Who Should Watch?

- Developers working with .NET, Python, JavaScript, Java, or Go
- Teams building enterprise AI solutions on Azure
- Organizations seeking secure authentication for AI integrations
- Anyone interested in agent-based app architectures with external tool/data connectivity
