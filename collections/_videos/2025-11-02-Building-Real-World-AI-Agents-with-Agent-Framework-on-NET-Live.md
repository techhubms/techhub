# Building Real-World AI Agents with Agent Framework on .NET Live

**Presented by:** Vic Perdana, Katie Savage, and Maira Wenzel

## Overview

This session explores moving beyond AI hype to tangible developer outcomes using the new Agent Framework (AF). AF is the next-generation evolution of Microsoft's Semantic Kernel and Autogen, designed for building robust, composable, production-ready AI agents.

## Featured Demo: SemantiClip

- **SemantiClip** is an open-source project that automates transforming video content into structured blog posts.
- Built using Agent Framework for modular, reusable agent logic.
- Integrates local and cloud-based LLMs.
- Demonstrates **tool calling**, **AI-based planning**, and persistent memory management with Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Technical Highlights

- **Agent Framework (AF):** The main focus, providing both 'agent' and 'process' frameworks:
  - *Agent framework* for smaller, focused co-pilot tasks
  - *Process framework* for orchestrating complex multi-agent workflows
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Used for deploying and scaling the solution with Microsoft cloud services.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Enables persistent, context-aware workflows by sharing memory/state across agents.
- **Orchestration patterns:** Best practices for interoperable, composable AI solutions

## Core Topics Covered

- Real-world agent architecture for developers
- How to choose between different AF orchestration models
- Open-source patterns and practical lessons from building SemantiClip
- Integrating tool usage, LLMs, and memory with MCP
- Adapting the frameworks for co-pilots, automation, and multi-agent systems

## Who Should Watch

- .NET and Microsoft cloud developers
- AI engineers interested in agent-based architectures
- Anyone seeking practical approaches to building and deploying AI experiences

## Notable Takeaways

- How Agent Framework and Azure AI Foundry work together
- Patterns you can implement immediately for building composable, context-aware agents
- Key distinctions between orchestration models in AF
