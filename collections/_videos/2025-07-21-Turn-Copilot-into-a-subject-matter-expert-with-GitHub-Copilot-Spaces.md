## Summary

GitHub's video introduces Copilot Spaces, a feature designed to enhance the relevance of AI-generated answers by contextualizing GitHub Copilot within specific domains or knowledge areas, such as a team's accessibility standards. By setting up a Copilot Space—a shared repository containing curated knowledge, documentation, and examples—teams can ensure that Copilot responds with information aligned to organizational practices and requirements.

### Key Features Presented

- **Shared Contextualization:** Users can create a shared Copilot Space encompassing standards, guidelines, or proprietary information relevant to their team or organization.
- **High-Quality, Specific Responses:** When queries like "Are these components compliant with our accessibility guidelines?" are posed, Copilot leverages only the curated data in the Space, leading to more precise, relevant answers versus generic AI responses.
- **Component Compliance Checks:** The video highlights a workflow where developers upload components to their Copilot Space and receive compliance analysis grounded in the team's standards. This helps automate validation processes and reduce knowledge silos within teams.
- **Ease of Use:** Viewers are encouraged to try the feature directly via the provided GitHub Spaces link, streamlining adoption for development teams seeking to tailor Copilot to their needs.

### Practical Benefits

- **Custom Knowledge Embedding:** Teams no longer depend solely on Copilot's global knowledge; they can embed context (like internal documentation or standards) for more accurate, context-sensitive responses.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Spaces serve as a shared resource, helping align development with organization-specific requirements, thus improving consistency and quality.
- **Accelerated Reviews:** By checking code against bespoke standards automatically, teams can free up reviewer time and reduce manual errors.

### Getting Started

The video provides a direct link to GitHub Copilot Spaces, inviting users to experiment with creating and collaborating within their own Spaces.

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot Spaces empowers teams to transform Copilot into a subject matter expert on their own standards and practices, improving both the relevance and assurance of AI support across development workflows.
