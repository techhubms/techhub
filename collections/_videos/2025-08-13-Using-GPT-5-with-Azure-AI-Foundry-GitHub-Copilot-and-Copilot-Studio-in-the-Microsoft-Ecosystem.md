# Using GPT-5 with Azure AI Foundry, GitHub Copilot, and Copilot Studio in the Microsoft Ecosystem

**Author:** John Savill's Technical Training

## Overview

This in-depth video explores the use of GPT-5 within Microsoft's ecosystem. John Savill demonstrates practical ways to leverage the capabilities of GPT-5 using key Microsoft AI services and tools, including Azure AI Foundry, GitHub Copilot, and Copilot Studio. The session presents:

- An introduction to GPT-5 and what’s new
- The tangible benefits of using GPT-5 for development and automation
- Integration methods with Azure AI Foundry for building and deploying large language models
- Enhancing coding workflows with GitHub Copilot
- Using Copilot Studio (the developer/maker tool, not the Office/365 Copilot productivity assistant) to build custom AI-powered agents

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. GPT-5 Benefits

- Performance improvements and expanded capabilities compared to previous models
- Use cases in code generation, automation, and conversational interfaces

### 2. Getting Started with GPT-5 on Microsoft

- Overview of supported Microsoft services for GPT-5 model use
- Access requirements and setup steps within the Microsoft cloud

### 3. Azure AI Foundry

- Deploying, managing, and fine-tuning GPT-5 models using Azure AI Foundry
- Key platform features for large-scale AI model hosting
- Integration patterns for developers

### 4. GitHub Copilot

- Practical ways to use GPT-5 via GitHub Copilot for productivity and code assistance
- Best practices for integrating Copilot into the development workflow

### 5. Copilot Studio

- Using Copilot Studio to build custom AI agents and workflows
- Differentiating developer/maker Copilot Studio from Microsoft 365 Copilot

### 6. Platform and Product Distinctions

- Explanations on which Microsoft Copilot offerings are development-focused (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Copilot Studio) versus productivity (e.g., Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Chat)
- Clarification on where GPT-5 directly supports code development
