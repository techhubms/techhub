# Subagents: Parallel Execution and Context Isolation

*Episode by Visual Studio Code (VS Code Team)*

## Overview

This episode explores how Visual Studio Code leverages subagents and agent-based architecture to streamline developer productivity, especially in combination with GitHub Copilot technology. Core topics include agent loops, context windows, isolating tasks through subagents, and optimizing model selection for improved performance.

## Key Concepts

### Agents, Subagents, and Context

- **Agent Loops**: Core mechanism by which VS Code's AI features communicate and maintain state.
- **Context Windows**: Sections of code, documents, or tasks that inform how agents operate.
- **Subagents**: Lightweight, task-isolated processes that execute parts of a task in parallel, reducing overhead for the main agent and preserving context fidelity.

### Benefits of Subagents

- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously, speeding up workflows.
- **Context Isolation**: Subagents keep task-specific data separate, reducing conflicts and increasing reliability.
- **Developer Focus**: Main agent can prioritize overall orchestration while delegating details to subagents.

### Development Practice Improvements

- **Better Automation**: Automation is smarter and less error-prone thanks to subagent architecture.
- **Custom Agents**: Developers can define their own agent logic to tailor workflow automation.
- **Model Optimization**: Adjusting AI model selections based on task requirements enables faster or more accurate code generation.
