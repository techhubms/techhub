# A Unified Agent Experience in Visual Studio Code

This video demonstrates the evolving role of Visual Studio Code as a unified workspace for coding agents. Developers can now manage their local, background, and cloud-based agent sessions from a single interface within VS Code. Key cloud agents discussed include Claude and Codex, enabling remote code execution and advanced collaboration.

**Topics Covered:**

- Managing **local and remote agent sessions** within Visual Studio Code
- Configuring **cloud agents** such as Claude and Codex for task delegation
- Leveraging **partner agent integrations** available to GitHub Copilot subscribers
- Collaborating with teams using **pull requests (PRs)** directly in the development workflow
- Streamlining task delegation to remote infrastructure for distributed development
