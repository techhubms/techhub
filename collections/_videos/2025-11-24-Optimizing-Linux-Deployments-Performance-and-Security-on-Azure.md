# Optimizing Linux Deployments: Performance and Security on Azure

## Overview

This Microsoft Ignite 2025 breakout session, led by Karl Abbott and Lachlan Evenson, focuses on advanced techniques for managing Linux environments on Azure—ranging from Ubuntu to Rocky Linux. It highlights Microsoft's open source contributions and the technical strategies for creating robust, performant, and secure cloud-native Linux architectures.

## Key Topics

- **Azure-Native Tools for Linux**: Utilizing Azure Monitor and Defender for Linux to stay compliant, monitor, and secure workloads.
- **Streamlining Image Creation**: How to deploy and customize Red Hat-based images and integrate existing licenses.
- **Workload Hardening & Compliance**: Implementing secure baselines for VM images and maintaining compliance.
- **Performance Monitoring & Tuning**:
  - Using eBPF and Inspector Gadget for deep packet and system inspection.
  - Network performance tuning (TCP optimizations, configuration changes), with practical demos of applying tuning files and measuring throughput improvements (up to 710 Mbps).
- **Operational Demos**:
  - Deploying a Linux VM via Azure portal and SSH verification.
  - Tuning and testing system-level performance.
- **Open Source and Cloud Native Ecosystem**: Microsoft’s engagement and integration across Linux and cloud native tools.

## Step-by-Step Highlights

1. **Open Source in Microsoft Ecosystem**: Discussion on cloud native and AI ecosystem contributions.
2. **Image Deployment**:
    - Demo: Customized Red Hat-based image creation
    - License integration
    - VM provisioning and connection via SSH
3. **Advanced System Inspection**:
    - eBPF and Inspector Gadget for live workload analysis
    - Performance metrics and diagnostic insights
4. **Network and Resource Tuning**:
    - Cross-region performance tuning
    - Practical steps for TCP configuration
    - Impact assessment through before/after tests
5. **Security and Compliance Tools**:
