# Azure Managed Redis Deep Dive

Presented by John Savill's Technical Training

## Overview

This session explores the essential aspects of Redis and provides a practical deep dive into how Azure Managed Redis operates and integrates with cloud-native solutions.

### Topics Covered

- **What is Redis**: Introduction to Redis fundamentals and its use cases as an in-memory key-value store.
- **Redis Data Types**: Coverage of standard Redis data types and their application in real-world scenarios.
- **Application Architectures**:
  - Common ways Redis is adopted in scalable applications
  - Case study: Redis in AI inferencing scenarios
- **Azure Managed Redis**:
  - Overview of deployment options (Single node, HA, Clusters)
  - Explains sharding mechanics and cluster policy
  - Configuration options for redundancy, durability, and geo-replication
  - Details on SLAs, active replicas, and multi-region support
  - SKU types, scaling strategies, and node management
- **Advanced Topics**:
  - Shard configuration
  - Replication meshes
  - Conflict-free Data Resolution
  - Client usage patterns
- **Operational Aspects**:
  - Data durability with HA
  - Maintenance modes
  - Security considerations (authentication, networking options)
