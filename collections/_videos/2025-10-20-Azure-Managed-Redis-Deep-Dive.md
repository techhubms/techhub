# Azure Managed Redis Deep Dive

Presented by John Savill's Technical Training

## Overview

This session explores the essential aspects of Redis and provides a practical deep dive into how Azure Managed Redis operates and integrates with cloud-native solutions.

### Topics Covered

- **What is Redis**: Introduction to Redis fundamentals and its use cases as an in-memory key-value store.
- **Redis Data Types**: Coverage of standard Redis data types and their application in real-world scenarios.
- **Application Architectures**:
    - Common ways Redis is adopted in scalable applications
    - Case study: Redis in AI inferencing scenarios
- **Azure Managed Redis**:
    - Overview of deployment options (Single node, HA, Clusters)
    - Explains sharding mechanics and cluster policy
    - Configuration options for redundancy, durability, and geo-replication
    - Details on SLAs, active replicas, and multi-region support
    - SKU types, scaling strategies, and node management
- **Advanced Topics**:
    - Shard configuration
    - Replication meshes
    - Conflict-free Data Resolution
    - Client usage patterns
- **Operational Aspects**:
    - Data durability with HA
    - Maintenance modes
    - Security considerations (authentication, networking options)
