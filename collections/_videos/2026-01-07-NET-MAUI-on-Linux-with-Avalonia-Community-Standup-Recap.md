# .NET MAUI Community Standup: Run .NET MAUI on Linux with Avalonia

## Overview

This community standup discusses the collaborative efforts to enable .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) applications to run on Linux, thanks to a backend powered by the Avalonia UI framework. Traditionally, .NET MAUI apps target Android, iOS, Mac Catalyst, and Windows, but Avalonia extends this reach to Linux and additional platforms.

## Key Topics

- **Project Status:** Update on Avalonia's .NET MAUI backend progress and integration.
- **Cross-Platform Strategy:** Insights into supporting Linux with the same MAUI codebase, alongside Android, iOS, Mac Catalyst, and Windows.
- **Technical Demos:** Demonstrations showing .NET MAUI applications running under Avalonia on Linux.
- **Developer Impact:** Implications for .NET developers seeking single codebases across more desktop and mobile platforms.
- **Community Resources:** Useful links and next steps for interested contributors or early adopters ([community link](https://www.theurlist.com/maui-standup-jan26)).

## Takeaways

- The Avalonia backend opens the door for .NET MAUI developers to reach Linux users without rewriting their app UIs.
- The cross-platform capabilities of .NET MAUI continue to grow thanks to community and open source collaboration.
- Real-world demos help illustrate the current state and future direction of cross-platform .NET UI development.
