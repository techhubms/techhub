# VS Code Live: Exploring Coding Agents and GitHub Copilot Integration

**Presented by:** Kyle Daigle, GitHub COO

Kickstarting Agent Sessions Day, this keynote unveils the latest updates in **Agent HQ**, with emphasis on:

- **Claude, Codex, and GitHub Copilot as coding agents**: Developers can now access these agents via a single subscription.
- **Parallel agent execution**: Run multiple AI coding agents side by side to compare how each addresses the same development problem.
- **Native workflow integration**: Maintain all development activities within your familiar GitHub and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment.

### Key Highlights

- **Unified Subscription**: Access Claude, Codex, and GitHub Copilot together.
- **Workflows**: Invoke, compare, and select outputs from multiple coding agents directly in GitHub and VS Code.
- **Productivity**: Streamlined integration promises higher efficiency for developers using AI-powered coding assistants without leaving their standard toolsets.
