# Azure Front Door Resiliency Deep Dive and Architecting for Mission Critical Applications

**Presented by: John Savill’s Technical Training**

This session focuses on designing highly available, resilient applications using Azure Front Door (AFD) and supporting Azure networking services. The video breaks down:

## Table of Contents

- **AFD Refresher:** Overview of Azure Front Door’s role in network traffic management
- **How is AFD Resilient:** Examines resiliency features, including:
  - Front end and fallback layers
  - Traffic Shield
  - DNS integration and protection mechanisms
- **Configuration Layers:**
  - System, Data, and Customer configurations
  - Removing asynchronous processes to improve reliability
- **Change Deployment:** Best practices for deploying changes to mitigate downtime
- **Mission Critical Service Considerations:**
  - Designing for both CDN and non-CDN scenarios
  - Reducing cross-tenant impact on high-demand workloads
- **Comparisons:**
  - Scenarios leveraging Azure Traffic Manager, DNS, and Front Door together
  - CDN vs. non-CDN service architectures
- **Reliability Reviews:**
  - Regularly reviewing architecture decisions for resiliency impact
- **Practical Resources:**
  - Whiteboard diagrams for visual reference ([link](https://github.com/johnthebrit/RandomStuff/raw/master/Whiteboards/AFDResilience.png))
  - Links to learning resources, playlist series, and further training

## Key Topics

- Ensuring high availability for mission-critical workloads on Azure
- Improving failover and fallback strategies within Azure’s network stack
