# .NET AI Community Standup: SQUAD – AI Agent Teams for Any Project

## Overview

This community session dives into SQUAD, an open-source orchestration framework tailored for C# and .NET developers. The discussion covers how AI agents are becoming central to modern application architectures and ways .NET developers can leverage SQUAD to enable intelligent, multi-agent systems in their solutions.

**Featured Speakers:**

- [Bruno Capuano](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/bruno-capuano)
- [Brady Gaster](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradygaster/)

## Key Topics

- **Introduction to SQUAD**: Overview of the SQUAD project ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bradygaster/squad)) and its purpose in supporting orchestration patterns for AI agents in .NET apps.
- **AI Agent Orchestration**: Exploring core orchestration techniques, real-world scenarios, and the role of SQUAD in managing multiple AI agents working within .NET solutions.
- **Integration with .NET Tools**: How to bring AI capabilities into existing or new C# applications using familiar .NET workflows and developer tooling.
- **Live Demonstrations**: Step-by-step walkthroughs showing how to use SQUAD for implementing intelligent features, integrating with Azure or other AI services, and handling communications between agents.

## Real-World Use Cases

- Building cloud-native applications enhanced with intelligent AI agent teams.
- Designing multi-agent systems using SQUAD and .NET’s established development stack.
- Processing complex tasks with coordinated AI-powered workflows.
