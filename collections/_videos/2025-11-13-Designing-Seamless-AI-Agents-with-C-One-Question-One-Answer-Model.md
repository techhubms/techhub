# Designing Seamless AI Agents with C#: One Question, One Answer Model

**Presented by Mark Miller (DevExpress, creator of CodeRush & AiGen) at .NET Conf 2025**

AI assistants often require chat-like iterative processes, which can disrupt user flow and place a burden on the end-user. In this session, Mark Miller introduces a "single-question, single-response" approach for C# developers aiming to create AI agents with seamless, immediate impact.

## Key Takeaways

- **The One-Question, One-Answer + Delta Model:**
  - AI agents respond with the right solution the first time, minimizing iterative chat and reducing user interaction overhead.
  - Outperforms traditional chat-based designs by accelerating workflows and boosting accuracy.

- **Context Injection for Better Results:**
  - Feeding AI agents the right context instantly ensures more reliable, relevant outputs in less time.
  - Techniques for context engineering in C# and .NET applications.

- **UX and Design Principles:**
  - Design strategies that make AI-powered apps more helpful and enjoyable.
  - Extending concepts from coding assistants to productivity and enterprise environments.

- **Proven AI Patterns in Practice:**
  - Real-world architecture for embedding AI features directly into .NET apps.
  - Patterns for trust, reliability, and seamless user experience.

## Who Should Watch?

- Developers interested in the next wave of pair programming with AI.
- Engineers embedding AI features into .NET/C# projects.
- Product teams aiming to provide intuitive, efficient AI experiences.
