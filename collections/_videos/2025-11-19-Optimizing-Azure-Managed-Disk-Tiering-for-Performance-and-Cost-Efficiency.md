# Optimizing Azure Managed Disk Tiering for Performance and Cost Efficiency

**Presented by:** Vatsal Rastogi at Microsoft Ignite 2025

## Overview

Managing cloud storage effectively is critical for both application performance and organizational ROI. Azure Managed Disks provide over six different performance and cost tiers, but teams often default to higher-cost options due to concerns about downtime and a lack of actionable insights. This can introduce significant operational inefficiencies, especially at scale.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Common Cloud Storage Challenges**
  - Difficulty assessing true performance needs
  - Hesitancy to switch tiers due to conversion downtime and complex processes
  - Poor visibility into actual disk usage leading to inefficient spending

- **Lucidity’s Solution**
  - Streamlines tier assessment and transition for Azure Managed Disks
  - Provides actionable insights to right-size storage allocation
  - Combines "Lumen" for simulation/implementation and "AutoScaler" for continuous optimization
  - Minimizes or eliminates downtime when changing storage tiers

- **Implementation Approach**
  - Simulate disk tier changes to estimate performance/cost impacts
  - Automate tier conversion with minimal manual steps
  - Integrate with existing Azure infrastructure for seamless management at scale

- **Results**
  - Enhanced application performance through appropriate disk tier selection
  - Reduced cloud spend via smarter, automated tiering
  - Improved operational agility for IT teams
