# Extending AI Agents: Live Demo of GitHub MCP Server Integration

## Introduction

In this live demo from GitHub Universe 2025, GitHub engineers Sam Morrow and Toby Padilla showcase the extensibility of AI agents with the GitHub MCP Server. The session highlights Copilot agent mode within VS Code and how agents can interact with GitHub via natural language.

---

## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The MCP is a protocol enabling code agents (like GitHub Copilot) to interact programmatically with GitHub resources, automating tasks via standardized APIs and interfaces.

## Installing the GitHub MCP Server in VS Code

- Follow guided steps to install and configure the MCP server extension for VS Code.
- Establish connections between your local development environment and GitHub through agent mode.

## Using Prompts to Automate GitHub Tasks

- Employ natural language prompts to execute common GitHub commands (issue creation, PR review, repository management).
- Demonstrate how AI agents carry out instructions and report back results.

## Visual Summaries and Mermaid Charts

- The agent can automatically generate summaries and visual diagrams (such as Mermaid charts) for repository structure and workflow status.
- Useful for understanding project architecture and ongoing activities.

## Integrating with the Copilot Coding Agent

- Showcases deep integration between Copilot and MCP, enabling multi-agent workflows (agent-to-agent communication).
- Example: Coordinating code changes, reviewing suggestions, merging pull requests—all driven by intelligent agents.

## Exploring the MCP Registry

- Browse registered agent components, discover new MCP tools, and configure integrations to further extend developer workflows.

## Key Takeaways

- GitHub MCP Server and Copilot agent mode enable advanced automation through natural language.
- Agents work collaboratively to streamline development and repository management.
- Extensible registry and prompt engineering unlock a highly customizable developer experience.
