# Building Trustworthy and Auditable AI Systems: Practical Strategies from Microsoft Ignite 2025

AI adoption is accelerating across enterprises, but ensuring that these solutions are reliable and transparent is critical for delivering legitimate business value. In this session, Microsoft experts Parker Johnston and Chris Thompson address foundational challenges of trust in AI — including the opacity of advanced models, the difficulty of auditing complex workflows, and common barriers to organizational adoption.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Transparent AI Models**: Techniques for making black-box models more interpretable and auditable in enterprise settings.
- **Workflow Traceability**: Best practices for monitoring AI pipelines to ensure decisions can be tracked and justified.
- **Overcoming Adoption Barriers**: Strategies for driving AI acceptance by enabling clear explanations and accountability in automated systems.
- **Enterprise Case Studies**: Lessons learned from real client engagements where trust and traceability surfaced as critical project requirements.
- **Microsoft AI Platform Tools**: Highlights of Azure AI capabilities supporting governance, explainability, and ongoing monitoring.

## Practical Strategies for Trusted AI

- Implementing clear documentation and metadata tracking for AI decisions
- Leveraging Azure AI auditing and monitoring features to maintain oversight
- Designing workflows that enable human review and explainable responses
