# Run Your AI Coding Agent in Containers: Complete Beginner's Guide

**Featuring:** James Montemagno (@JamesMontemagno)

Explore how to bundle your entire development environment—including SDKs, runtimes, extensions, and tools—into a secure, portable container. This approach allows developers to create consistent dev setups across different machines and projects.

## Why Dev Containers?

- Encapsulate all development dependencies in a single container
- Achieve consistent, reproducible development environments
- Enhance security and portability for your workflows

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Introduction

- Learn the challenges of managing dependencies and setups across projects
- Understand how Dev Containers solve environment drift and setup time

### 2. Setting Up Your First Dev Container

- Walkthrough on initializing a Dev Container using Visual Studio Code
- Instructions on bundling SDKs, runtimes, and extensions
- Demonstration of best practices in container configuration

### 3. Running AI Coding Agents Inside Dev Containers

- Explanation of AI coding agents and why they benefit from containerized environments
- Practical steps to install and run coding agents within a container

### 4. Leveraging GitHub Codespaces

- Demonstration of how Dev Containers enable cloud-based development with GitHub Codespaces
- Seamless transition from local to remote development environments

## Key Takeaways

- Utilizing Dev Containers and Codespaces dramatically improves developer productivity
- Secure, consistent dev setups accelerate onboarding and offer flexibility
- Best suited for developers working across multiple projects or teams
