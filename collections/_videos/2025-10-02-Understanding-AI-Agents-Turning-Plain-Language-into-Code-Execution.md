# What is an AI Agent?

**Presenter:** Seth Juarez (Microsoft Developer)

The term **“AI agent”** is often mentioned in technical conversations, but what does it specifically mean in a developer context?

## Key Concepts

- **AI Agent Definition:**
  - An AI agent is a new kind of control structure that can translate plain (natural) language input into actionable code or operations.
  - Unlike traditional programming models, AI agents use models that understand and execute instructions written in human language, bridging the gap between intent and execution.

- **How They Work:**
  - AI agents leverage advanced language models (such as those available in Azure OpenAI Service) to parse user input, interpret intent, and generate code or perform tasks automatically.
  - This represents a shift from deterministic programming to probabilistic, intent-driven execution structures.

- **Why This Matters:**
  - Developers can harness AI agents to create applications that are more intuitive and responsive to user needs.

## Applications

- AI agents can be integrated into chatbots, workflow automation tools, and developer productivity solutions.
- Microsoft’s AI platforms and services provide APIs and infrastructure to help developers implement, fine-tune, and scale AI agents as part of their systems.
