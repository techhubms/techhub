# Resiliency and Recovery with Azure Backup and Site Recovery

## Overview

This advanced Microsoft Ignite session explores how to modernize data resilience and cyber recovery using Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery, integrated with Microsoft Defender.

**Key Topics:**

- Protecting Azure VMs, databases, file shares, and cloud-native workloads (e.g., AKS)
- Secure-by-default backup architecture and immutable storage
- Intelligent threat detection and response
- Orchestrating at-scale, clean restores for disaster recovery
- Meeting compliance objectives (RPO/RTO)

## Chapters & Highlights

### 0:00 – Focus on Data Resiliency and Defender Integration

Azure Backup is integrated with Defender to enhance security and threat response for all protected workloads.

### 7:00 – Deep Dive: Data Resiliency & Recovery Scenarios

Detailed strategies for handling data backup and recovery across diverse Azure environments.

### 7:57 – Introduction: Infrastructure Service Workload Scenario

Examining backup and recovery for typical application architectures.

### 8:10 – Two-Tier Application Architecture

How to design and secure backup strategies for systems with frontend VMs and backend databases.

### 10:52 – Demo: Two-Tier Backup Process

Live demonstration of setting up and managing application backups in Azure.

### 16:51 – Backing Up Containers and Stateless Resources

Approaches for container-aware protection, especially for AKS clusters and microservices environments.

### 19:16 – Demo: Kubernetes Cluster Backup

Practical guide to backup AKS clusters leveraging Azure resiliency features.

### 22:44 – Cyber Recovery for Unstructured Data

Covering unified data protection for all resource types, including file shares and non-relational storage.

### 28:42 – Replication, RPO, SLA Improvements

Latest enhancements to Azure Backup and Site Recovery with improved replication, stricter SLAs, and higher performance throughput.

## Modern Backup and Recovery Features

- **Immutable Storage:** Ensures backups cannot be tampered with or deleted maliciously.
- **Threat-Aware Protection:** Uses intelligent telemetry signals for backup status and anomaly detection.
- **One-Click Disaster Recovery (DR):** Simplifies restore operations so organizations can rapidly recover from disruptions.
- **Compliance-Focused Design:** Helps enterprises meet stringent RPO/RTO and regulatory requirements.
- **Integration with Defender:** Extends threat detection, response, and unified security posture for all backup workloads.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Orchestrate large-scale, clean restores confidently** for VMs, containers, and databases.
- **Meet business continuity needs** with secure, modern backup strategies and seamless disaster recovery solutions.
- **Protect advanced workloads** such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and unstructured data sources.
