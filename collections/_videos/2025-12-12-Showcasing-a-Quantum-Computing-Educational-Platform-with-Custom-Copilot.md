# Showcasing a Quantum Computing Educational Platform with Custom Copilot

**Presenter:** Johnny Hooyberghs

This session highlights a custom educational platform developed for a Microsoft quantum computing workshop:

- **Platform Architecture:**
  - Built on ASP.NET Blazor web technology using .NET
  - Hosted via Microsoft Azure cloud services
- **Features:**
  - Interactive interface for participants to solve Q# programming challenges
  - Real-time feedback provided by running user solutions through the Q# compiler and simulator
  - Immediate feedback assists learning and experimentation with quantum algorithms
  - Built-in custom Copilot with access to current challenges and proposed solutions
  - Copilot offers recommendations, hints, and educational support tailored to each user
- **Technologies Used:**
  - Q# for quantum programming
  - .NET and ASP.NET Blazor for web application
  - Azure cloud hosting and possibly integration with Azure Quantum
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - Participants gain hands-on experience with Microsoft’s quantum computing tools
  - The platform supports exploratory learning and fosters a community among workshop attendees

### Key Takeaways

- Leverage ASP.NET Blazor and .NET for interactive web applications targeting scientific education
- Integrate Q# tooling and simulators for real-time code assessment
- Utilize Azure’s infrastructure for scalable, reliable cloud computing and hosting
- Enhance educational experiences with custom AI-powered assistants (Copilot)
