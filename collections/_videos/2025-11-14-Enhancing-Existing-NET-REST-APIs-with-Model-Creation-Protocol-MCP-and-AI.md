# Enhancing Existing .NET REST APIs with Model Creation Protocol (MCP) and AI

Your existing .NET Web APIs have served their purpose well, but there's potential to make them more intelligent in the era of AI. In this session, dotnet demonstrates how you can transform your existing ASP.NET Core Web API endpoints by integrating Model Creation Protocol (MCP) capabilities, making them accessible to large language models (LLMs) and AI agents.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Annotating Controllers with MCP C# SDK:**
  Learn how the MCP C# SDK enables you to easily add MCP annotations to existing API controllers, instantly enhancing your REST endpoints with AI capabilities.

- **AI-Powered Endpoints:**
  By adding MCP, your APIs become compatible with LLMs and agents, making them smarter and suitable for more advanced integrations.

- **No-Code Alternatives:**
  The video compares the code-based approach to no-code options using Azure API Management, discussing pros and cons of each.

- **Design Considerations & Limitations:**
  Understand the limitations of these approaches and why they're only starting points for achieving robust, long-term MCP implementations.

- **Evolution Path:**
  Get practical guidance on evolving your APIs from basic technical plumbing to sophisticated, task-focused, intelligent endpoints.
