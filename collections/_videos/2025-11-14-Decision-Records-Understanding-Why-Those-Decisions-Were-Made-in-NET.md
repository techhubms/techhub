description: "This resource explores the practice of using Decision Records in .NET development. It discusses how documenting architectural and design choices—such as authentication with ASP.NET Identity, service discovery in .NET Aspire, and UI strategies in Blazor—can lead to more maintainable, auditable, and comprehensible applications. The content references new features in .NET 10, ASP.NET Core 10, MAUI 10, C# 14, F# 10, and highlights the tools and conferences supporting the contemporary .NET ecosystem."

# Decision Records: Understanding Why Those Decisions Were Made in .NET

Developers often face complex .NET systems and wonder why a particular design or architectural choice was made. This presentation addresses this by introducing Decision Records—detailed, searchable logs documenting every major decision in your application.

## What Are Decision Records?

- Structured documentation of key choices in .NET projects
- Useful for:
  - Authentication (e.g., ASP.NET Identity)
  - Service discovery (.NET Aspire)
  - UI architecture (Blazor)
- Build systems that are
  - More maintainable
  - Easier to audit
  - Less frustrating for future developers

## Examples of Decision Record Applications

- **.NET Aspire 13**: Streamlining cloud-native orchestration ([More info](https://aka.ms/aspire13/announcement))
- **ASP.NET Core 10**: Secure, modern web development ([More info](https://aka.ms/asp/dotnet/2025))
- **.NET MAUI 10**: Multi-platform UI strategies ([Details](https://aka.ms/dotnet/maui/2025))
- **C# 14 & F# 10**: Utilizing new language features in architectural decisions ([C# 14](https://aka.ms/csharp14/announcement/2025); [F# 10](https://aka.ms/fsharp10/2025/announcement))
- **Visual Studio 2026**: Leveraging improvements for codebase documentation ([Announcement](https://aka.ms/visualstudio2026/announcement))

## Why Document Decisions?

- Prevent knowledge loss during team transitions
- Provide rationale for specific approaches (e.g., why choose one authentication method over another)
- Make it easier to audit and enhance the solution later

## Conclusion

Decision Records empower you to build .NET applications that are easier to understand, maintain, and evolve. By capturing the reasoning behind each key decision, you unlock deeper insights into your codebase and ensure smoother transitions as projects grow and teams change.
