# Building Modern CLI Apps in .NET: Libraries, Patterns, and Packaging

Command-line applications have persisted through the decades, and in today's era of cloud, DevOps, and automation, they're more vital than ever. This session, led by the .NET team, examines the ongoing role of CLIs and the reasons behind their renewed momentum.

## Key Topics Covered

- **The Enduring Value of CLIs:**
  - Despite GUI dominance, CLIs remain essential for automating workflows, enabling scripting, and supporting DevOps and cloud-native requirements.
- **Why .NET for Modern CLI Development:**
  - .NET's cross-platform capabilities make it an ideal foundation for building portable CLI tools.
  - The platform supports robust performance, elegant syntax, and a wide range of supported languages (C#, F#, VB.NET).
- **Highlights from Latest .NET Announcements:**
  - [**.NET 10**](https://aka.ms/dotnet10/): Enhanced intelligence and a unified ecosystem.
