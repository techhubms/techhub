  - Enables planning steps, invoking tools, editing files, and running commands within developer-defined constraints and domains

- **Technical Features:**
  - Exposes the core behind Copilot CLI
  - Integrates with domain-specific tools and app context
  - Designed for extensibility and open-source contribution

- **Developer Experience:**
  - Embedding AI assistants into applications
  - Leveraging the SDK for automation and improved workflow within open-source projects

- **Contribution and Community Involvement:**
  - SDK is in technical preview; feedback and contributors are encouraged
  - Walkthrough of architecture and areas for community impact

## How to Get Involved

- Access the Copilot SDK via [github/copilot-sdk](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk)
