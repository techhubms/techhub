## Key Topics Covered

### 1. Azure Storage for AI Workloads

- **Azure Blob Storage**: Scales to meet demanding AI data requirements.
- **Azure Container Storage & Blobfuse2**: Ensure GPUs remain utilized and speed up access.

### 2. Integration with AI Frameworks

- **Ray/KAITO Integration for AKS**: Simplifies running distributed AI jobs on Azure Kubernetes Service.
- **LangChain on Azure**: Easy method for AI app development and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

### 3. AI Training and Data Preparation

- **Deep Dive** into workflow for training and fine-tuning AI models on Azure.
- **Data Preparation Steps** (incl. RAG): Convert enterprise data to formats ready for AI consumption.

### 4. Security and Performance

- **Network & Data Security** practices for AI environments.
- Unified management through **Azure Storage Center**.
- Methods for maximizing developer velocity and infrastructure reliability.

### 5. Demonstrations

- Live demos of Azure Storage Center and integrating storage with Microsoft AI services.

### 6. Best Practices

- Tips for performance tuning, secure storage access, and scalable AI solution architecture.
- Guidance on blending open-source frameworks (Ray, KAITO, LangChain) with managed Azure services.
