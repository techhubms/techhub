# From Issue to PR: Asynchronously Develop with GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

**Speakers:**

- Luke Hoban (Microsoft)
- Priyanka Vergadia (host)

## Overview

GitHub Copilot has transformed over the last four years from a basic code suggestion tool to an autonomous coding agent capable of handling entire tasks. This session demonstrates:

- Assigning entire GitHub issues to Copilot agents and letting AI handle bug fixes and documentation edits.
- Using the new command center at [github.com/copilot/agents](https://github.com/copilot/agents) to oversee, initiate, and manage autonomous AI work.
- Deep integration with features like built-in web browser testing, Playwright for visual testing, and automated screenshot documentation.
- Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expand agent functionality, adding new extensibility options.
- Mobile creation of development tasks, enabling remote task initiation.

## Key Insights

- **Evolution of Copilot:** Shifted from 'next line suggestions' to autonomous, end-to-end task execution.
- **Hands-off Development:** Developers can assign backlog items using natural language, with AI agents working autonomously for extended periods.
- **Example Demo:** A longstanding GitHub CLI bug is fixed by Copilot agent without manual intervention.
- **Automated Documentation:** Copilot agents perform documentation improvements and generate supporting screenshots.
- **Team Collaboration:** Features support both individual and broader team productivity, helping prioritize high-impact work.

## Technical Highlights

- **Command Center:** Centralized dashboard for task assignment and AI management.
- **MCP Integration:** Model Context Protocol augments agent capabilities for extensibility.
- **Web Testing and Playwright:** Automated visual regression testing and report generation.
- **Session Logging:** Full logs for multi-minute autonomous sessions, providing transparency and troubleshooting capabilities.
