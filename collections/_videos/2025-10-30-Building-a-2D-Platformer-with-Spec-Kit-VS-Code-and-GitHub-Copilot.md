# Building a 2D Platformer with Spec Kit, VS Code, and GitHub Copilot

**Presented by:** Den Delimarsky & James Montemagno

During this GitHub Universe session, Den and James collaborate to create a full 2D platformer game using the following tools:

- **Spec Kit**: A tool for spec-driven game development, allowing a structured approach to building game features.
- **Visual Studio Code**: The editor of choice for rapid prototyping and code editing.
- **GitHub Copilot**: An AI-powered coding assistant that provides code completions, suggestions, and support directly within VS Code.

## What You’ll Learn

- **Integrating Spec Kit workflow**: How to structure a game project by defining specs and implementing features iteratively.
- **Working with GitHub Copilot**: Demonstrations of how Copilot assists with game logic, asset integration, and test code snippets.
- **Best Practices in VS Code**: Customizing the development environment for productivity, using extensions relevant to game development.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Iteratively building game mechanics such as player movement, collision detection, and rendering.
- **Community Engagement**: The GitHub repository is available for viewers to try the code and contribute.
