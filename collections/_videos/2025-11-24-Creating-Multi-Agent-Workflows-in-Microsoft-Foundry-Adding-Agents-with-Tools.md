# Creating Multi-Agent Workflows in Microsoft Foundry: Adding Agents with Tools

**Author:** April (Microsoft Developer)

This video is Part 2 of the Microsoft Foundry Workflows series. April guides viewers through:

## Overview

- Demonstrates the creation of agents in Microsoft Foundry and their integration into a multi-agent, sequential workflow.
- Covers how to enable agents to access files using File Search tools.

## Key Steps

1. **Workflow Scenario Introduction**
   - Sets the stage for a multi-agent Workflow using Microsoft Foundry.
2. **Agent Creation**
   - Builds three agents with distinct roles:
     - **Product Researcher**: Gathers information from files using File Search.
     - **Marketing Copywriter**: Generates marketing content based on data retrieved.
     - **Social Media Strategist**: Prepares content for social platforms.
   - Each agent is assigned access to specific tools within the Foundry environment.
3. **Adding Agents to Sequential Workflow**
   - Incorporates the created agents into a workflow configured in Part 1.
   - Shows how to set agent order and interaction.
4. **Workflow Testing**
   - Runs the workflow to validate agent actions and interactions.
   - Reviews success criteria and error handling.
5. **Viewing Workflow Traces**
   - Analyzes execution traces within Foundry to inspect agent performance and outcomes.
