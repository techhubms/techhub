# Deep Dive into Microsoft Agent Framework for AutoGen Users

**Presented by Eric Zhu (Microsoft Developer)**

This comprehensive video explores the Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF)—a new open-source project that unifies Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into a single pro-code SDK for building advanced multi-agent AI systems on Azure.

## Overview

- **Migration Path:** Stepwise guidance for AutoGen users migrating to MAF, highlighting what remains consistent and what changes.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Model client setup
  - Single-agent features
  - MCP support
  - Agent-as-a-tool
  - Multi-agent orchestration (with side-by-side code comparisons)
  - Comprehensive discussion of core differences (conversation state, memory, message types, middleware)

## What is Microsoft Agent Framework?

- **Unified SDK:** MAF combines Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into one platform for developing composable, programmable multi-agent solutions.
- **Roots:** AutoGen started at Microsoft Research and became known for GroupChat and event-driven orchestration.
- **Community Driven:** Contributions from internal teams and the open-source community have enhanced critical features and extensibility.

## Key Feature Demonstrations

### 1. Model Clients

- Overview of setting up and managing model clients in MAF.

### 2. Single-Agent Features

- Core interface and capabilities for single-agent scenarios.
- Handling tool usage and streaming responses.

### 3. Multi-Agent Orchestration

- Implementation of sequential, concurrent, and advanced orchestration patterns.
- Side-by-side code demonstrations contrasting AutoGen and MAF approaches.

### 4. MCP Support & Agent-as-a-Tool

- Integrating with the Multi-Channel Platform (MCP) and enabling agents to function as callable tools.

### 5. Workflow Patterns and Differences

- In-depth comparison of 'GraphFlow' vs. traditional workflow models
- Message types, conversation memory/state, and the new middleware architecture.
- Advanced orchestration logic including conditionals, fan-out/join, and targeted routing.

### 6. Dev Tools and UI

- Differences between the MAF Developer UI, Debug UI, and the legacy AutoGen Studio.
