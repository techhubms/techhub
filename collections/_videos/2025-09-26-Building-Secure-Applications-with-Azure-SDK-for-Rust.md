# Building Secure Applications with Azure SDK for Rust

**Speaker:** Heath Stewart
**Event:** Microsoft Build 2025

## Overview

This session demonstrates how the Azure SDK for Rust enables developers to create secure, memory-safe, and efficient cloud applications. Using practical examples, such as managing secrets with Azure Key Vault, viewers learn strategies and best practices for robust application security on Azure.

## Key Topics

- **Azure SDK for Rust:** Overview and features
- **Security by Default:** How Rust's type system and memory safety enhance security
- **Practical Use Cases:**
  - Managing secrets using Azure Key Vault
  - Integrating Azure services with Rust applications
- **Performance Considerations:** Achieving high performance in the cloud with Rust
- **Developer Experience:**
  - Getting started with the Azure SDK for Rust
  - Who should consider Rust for Azure applications
  - Resources for learning more

## Example Scenario: Managing Secrets with Azure Key Vault

- Authenticate your Rust app with Azure
- Use the Azure SDK to securely store and retrieve secrets
- Apply best practices to keep applications "secure by default"

## Who Should Watch

- Developers new to Rust
- Experienced Rust developers interested in Azure
- Anyone building secure cloud applications on Azure

## Resources

- [Azure SDK for Rust Documentation](https://aka.ms/build25/plan/ADAI_DevStartPlan)
- [Microsoft Build 2025 Sessions](https://build.microsoft.com)

## Conclusion

The session equips developers with practical knowledge to harness Rust together with Azure for building applications that are secure, reliable, and high-performing by default.
