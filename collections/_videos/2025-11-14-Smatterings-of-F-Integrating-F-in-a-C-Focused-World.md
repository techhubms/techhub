# Smatterings of F#: Integrating F# in a C#-Focused World

**Speaker:** Matthew Watt  
**Event:** .NET Conf 2025

## Overview

Are you a .NET developer tethered to C# or VB.NET? Matthew Watt's talk explores the often-overlooked power of F#—a functional-first language in the .NET family. Whether you are a seasoned F# advocate or a C# fanatic curious about new paradigms, this session encourages inclusive experimentation and pragmatic use of F# in C#-dominated environments.

## Key Takeaways

- **Expanding Beyond C#:** C# is central to .NET, but F# offers different ways of thinking that can enhance your programming arsenal.
- **Accessibility:** You don't need to convince your whole team to migrate or wear an "F# Developer" badge to bring some F# into your work.

## Practical Examples

- **Astro Blog Enhancements:** Matthew discusses building a simple commenting system and other frontend components using F# alongside an Astro-based blog, showing how F# can augment existing projects without requiring a rewrite.
- **Open Source Contributions:** Tips for making meaningful contributions to F# projects—from fixing missing functionality to improving documentation—demonstrate that getting involved doesn't require groundbreaking changes.

## Strategies for Adoption

- **Small Wins:** Use "smatterings" of F# in supportive roles to add value without disrupting established C# workflows.
- **Community Engagement:** Share your F# experiences and give back through open source.
- **Mindset Shift:** Exploring F# concepts can improve your C# code, promote new ways of solving problems, and foster innovation.

## Who Should Watch?

- C# developers curious about F# and wanting to experiment safely.
- Secret F# fans hesitant to introduce it at work.
- Anyone seeking practical steps to combine functional programming with their .NET work.
