# Introducing MCP Apps: Interactive UI Components in VS Code Chat

Visual Studio Code presents advancements in Copilot Chat through **MCP Apps**, a system that enables tool calls to return rich, interactive UI components—such as dashboards, forms, visualizations, and multi-step workflows—directly in the chat interface.

## What Are MCP Apps?

- MCP Apps extend Copilot Chat and compatible tools in VS Code
- Allow tools to present dashboards, custom forms, and complex workflows inside chat
- Facilitate more natural and powerful collaboration between humans and AI agents

## Key Features Covered

- **Official MCP extension**: The first extension enabling this capability in VS Code
- **Interactive components**: Return UI elements rather than plain text answers
- **Use cases**: Data visualization, filling forms, triggering automation, and more

## Latest Updates

- New MCP features available in VS Code Insider builds
- Enhanced integration with Copilot Chat
- Improved workflow for developers engaging with AI directly within the editor
