# Debugging in Godot & Visual Studio Code (Part 6 of 9)

**Author:** dotnet

Debugging is an essential process in game development. In this video, the .NET team walks through practical techniques to diagnose and fix issues in Godot C# projects, leveraging both Godot's built-in debugging features and Visual Studio Code's debugging capabilities.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Godot’s Built-In Debugging Tools**: Learn to use Godot’s debugger and Remote tab for live scene data inspection.
- **Visualizing Collisions**: Visualize collision shapes and physics bodies to better understand gameplay issues.
- **Using Print, Warnings, and Errors**: Add diagnostic output to trace problems.
- **Visual Studio Code Debugging**: Set standard and conditional breakpoints, use watch expressions, examine the call stack, and explore the debug console.
- **Challenge**: Try adding conditional breakpoints that trigger only when certain values are met, pausing gameplay to inspect state.
