# Building a Professional Clinic Web App with GitHub Copilot and Azure SQL for Under $10

## Overview

In this video, Amar and Arvind from Microsoft Developer demonstrate the process of developing a production-ready web application for a university dental clinic. The primary goals were fast delivery, low cost, high security, and AI-powered features, all using predominantly Microsoft technologies for under $10 total cost.

## Key Technologies Used

- **GitHub Copilot Pro**: Used in VS Code to scaffold the .NET solution, generate deployment scripts, and accelerate debugging through AI-driven suggestions.
- **Azure SQL Database (Free Offer)**: Serves as the backend data platform, facilitating secure and cost-efficient data storage.
- **Azure App Service (F1 Tier)**: Hosts the web application with minimal operating cost.
- **Azure OpenAI**: Integrates AI summarization for patient medical histories, making use of advanced natural language processing.
- **Microsoft Entra ID (Managed Identity)**: Implements secure, password-less authentication for compliance and operational safety.

## Workflow Highlights

- **Persona-Driven Requirements**: Capturing user stories for patients, front office staff, and providers to drive development priorities.
- **Copilot-First Workflow**: Leveraging GitHub Copilot Pro for rapid scaffolding, script authoring, and debugging, reducing manual coding overhead.
- **Core Features**:
  - Conflict-free scheduling
  - Secure role-based access
  - Detailed billing
  - AI-powered summarization of medical data
- **Zero-Cost Cost Control**: Utilizing Azure's free offering tiers (App Service F1 and SQL Database) and managed identities to minimize operational costs while preserving professional-grade reliability and compliance.
- **Security and Compliance**: Password-less authentication via managed identities and secure API invocation using Microsoft Entra ID.

## Architecture & Deployment

- The app is structured with a .NET backend and utilizes deployment scripts generated by Copilot.
- Managed identity enables secure connections between the application, databases, and Azure AI services without requiring credentials.
- The team shares a full cost breakdown and architectural patterns for “smart features on a smart budget.”

## Key Takeaways

- Professional, production-grade applications can be quickly built and iterated using AI-powered development tools.
- Azure’s free tier offerings make high-quality, secure, and scalable deployments possible for minimal cost.
- Integrating AI for clinical data handling can improve user experiences and efficiency.
- Secure, compliant authentication is achievable through managed identity patterns in the Azure ecosystem.
