# Refactor an Existing Codebase Using Prompt-Driven Development with GitHub Copilot

**Featuring:** Gwyneth Peña-Siguenza (@madebygps)  
**Produced by Visual Studio Code
**

This session demonstrates how to leverage GitHub Copilot to refactor an e-commerce inventory management app written with FastAPI and Azure Cosmos DB. The walkthrough covers recognizing code smells, building contextually-rich prompts, running Copilot in Agent Mode for refactoring tasks, and reviewing AI-generated improvements step by step. The approach emphasizes best practices for integrating AI assistance into real-world development workflows.
