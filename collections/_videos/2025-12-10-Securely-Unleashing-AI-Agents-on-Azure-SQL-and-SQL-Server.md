# Securely Unleashing AI Agents on Azure SQL and SQL Server

AI agents are becoming integral to enterprise solutions, but their interaction with sensitive data in Azure SQL Database and SQL Server demands rigorous security measures. This session addresses major security risks posed by autonomous agents—including unpredictable actions, data leaks, and compliance issues—and provides concrete techniques to mitigate them.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Security Boundaries**: Proven methods to enforce separation between AI agents and sensitive enterprise data.
- **Least-Privilege Access**: Strategies to ensure AI agents have only the permissions they need, minimizing exposure.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Data Exposure**: Techniques for monitoring interactions and preventing data leaks.
- **Schema Understanding**: Addressing the challenges posed by complex database schemas that can lead to agent query errors.
- **Improving Agent Reliability**: Practical ways to help agents better interpret schemas and construct reliable queries.
- **Compliance and Risk Management**: Handling compliance and governance concerns when deploying AI agents.
