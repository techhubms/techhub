The workshop covers the fundamentals of MCP, explaining how this protocol enables seamless communication between AI models and various client applications. Participants will learn about the architecture and design principles behind MCP, understanding why standardization is crucial for AI application development. The session features hands-on examples and practical demonstrations, making complex concepts accessible to developers of all skill levels.

Katie Savage and James Montemagno walk through the process of setting up a development environment and building a functional MCP server from scratch. The presentation includes live coding sessions, best practices for implementation, and common pitfalls to avoid. Developers will gain practical experience with C# implementation patterns specific to MCP, learning how to leverage existing .NET libraries and frameworks to create robust, scalable solutions.

The workshop also highlights the broader ecosystem surrounding MCP, including upcoming MCP Dev Days events scheduled for July 29 & 30, and provides resources for further learning in multiple programming languages. This makes it an excellent starting point for developers looking to expand their AI development skills and stay current with emerging protocols and standards in the field.
