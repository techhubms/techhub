# MCP and Java Apps: Building a Server

**Episode Hosts:** Ayan Gupta, Bruno Borges, Sandra Ahlgrimm

This episode provides a hands-on demonstration of building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using Quarkus—a modern Java framework—and GitHub Copilot for automated code generation.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) extends AI applications by allowing direct integration with external tools, APIs, and services. Analogous to a barista who understands recipes and manages brewing, the MCP server orchestrates communication between AI models and third-party services.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Starting with a Quarkus Project**: Set up a Java project suited for cloud applications and rapid development.
- **Using MCP to Simplify API Changes**: Learn how MCP abstracts complex integrations by defining protocols and attributes.
- **Leveraging GitHub Copilot**: Use Copilot's agent mode and custom instructions to scaffold most of the server, significantly reducing manual code creation.
- **Building a Sample 'Monkey Species' API**: Implement endpoints to list species, get details, and handle statistics—demonstrating MCP attributes and Quarkus best practices.
- **Testing and Troubleshooting**:
  - Test your server using MCP Inspector
  - Resolve port conflicts
  - Prepare for client integration
  - Connect and list MCP tools

## Practical Insights

- Service annotations with MCP-specific attributes
- Endpoint configuration using server-sent events
- Best practices in Java records and API development
- Steps for automated scaffolding and understanding generated code

## Applicability

While demonstrated with a "monkey species" example, these design patterns are adaptable to customer data, inventory, finance, and more. The approach benefits any domain requiring dynamic AI-powered integrations.
