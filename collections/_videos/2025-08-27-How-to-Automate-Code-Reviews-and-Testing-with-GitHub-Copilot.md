# How to Automate Code Reviews and Testing with GitHub Copilot

GitHub demonstrates in this video the modern code review and testing workflow enhanced by GitHub Copilot's AI capabilities. Despite advancements in AI, the fundamentals of DevOps—such as thorough code review and verification—continue to be critical.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Code Review Integration**: Copilot can join the review process like any other team member, providing automated suggestions and identifying code issues.
- **Autofix & Security Scanning**: Copilot analyzes code changes, detects both standard and security-specific issues, and offers autofix suggestions that can be reviewed in detail by developers.
- **Requesting Changes and Validation**: Developers retain control, reviewing Copilot's recommendations, requesting alternative solutions, and ensuring best practices are followed before merging.
- **Pull Requests and Testing**: The workflow emphasizes automated testing, with Copilot participating in the testing phase by recognizing problems and suggesting corrections.
- **Repo Settings and Collaboration**: The importance of repository configuration and collaborative processes is discussed, demonstrating full team integration for code quality.

## Workflow Steps (As Shown in the Video)

1. **Introduction** (00:00)
2. **Code Review** (00:40)
3. **AutoFix & Scanning** (02:00)
4. **Applying Suggestions** (03:20)
5. **Repository Settings** (04:20)
6. **Pull Requests & Testing** (05:20)
7. **Final Validation** (06:20)

Repo maintainers and developers can interact with Copilot's code suggestions just as they would with any team member, enhancing but not replacing standard DevOps processes. This shows AI as a collaborator rather than a complete substitute for human oversight.
