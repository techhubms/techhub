# Building an AI Agent with Microsoft Foundry Models in Python

Learn how to create and deploy an AI agent using Microsoft Foundry models with Python, guided by Microsoft Developer.

## Overview

This tutorial walks you through the process of:

- Deploying a Foundry model on Azure
- Setting up your development environment with Python and Visual Studio Code
- Creating an AI agent using the deployed model
- Interacting with the agent through chat
- Viewing agent traces and monitoring activity using the Microsoft Foundry portal

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Deploy a Microsoft Foundry Model

Start by deploying an AI model in Microsoft Foundry. Access the Foundry portal here: [Microsoft Foundry](https://ai.azure.com).

### 2. Set Up the Environment

- Use Visual Studio Code for development
- Install Python and necessary dependencies (see the provided sample code)
- Configure access and authentication for your Foundry resources

### 3. Create the AI Agent

- Follow the sample code for agent creation ([Sample Code](https://aka.ms/insideMF/samples))
- Implement the agent logic in Python, connecting to the deployed Foundry model

### 4. Chat with the Agent

- Test your AI agent by interacting through a chat interface
- Observe how the agent leverages the deployed Foundry model responses

### 5. View Agent Traces in Foundry Portal

- Use the Microsoft Foundry portal to monitor agent activity and trace chats
- Analyze agent performance and adjust your implementation as needed
