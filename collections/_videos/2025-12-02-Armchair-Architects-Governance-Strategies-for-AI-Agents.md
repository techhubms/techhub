# Armchair Architects: Governance Strategies for AI Agents

**Hosts:** Uli Homann, Eric Charran, David Blank-Edelman
**Series:** Azure Essentials Show – Armchair Architects

## Overview

This episode explores the specific requirements and strategies for governing AI agents as distinct from traditional microservice architectures. The discussion highlights why modern enterprises must rethink monitoring, governance, and security when working with AI-powered agents.

## Key Topics

- **Agent Governance vs. Microservices:**
  - AI agents involve cognitive operations, requiring observability and reasoning transparency beyond typical microservices.
  - Governance for agents should focus on evaluating their decision-making and operational boundaries.

- **Observability and Evaluation:**
  - Monitoring must address both design-time (when building agents) and execution-time (when agents run in production).
  - Guardrails and evaluators are vital to ensure responsible agent behavior.
  - Techniques include agent cognition analysis, tool interaction monitoring, and memory management checks.

- **Identity and Model Routing:**
  - Agent identity affects security, entitlements, and operational dynamics.
  - Proper model routing is essential for flexibility and risk management.

- **Monitoring Strategies:**
  - New dimensions of monitoring are needed, covering agent performance, cost, and layered evaluation processes.

## Actionable Advice

- Review and adapt existing governance models for the unique requirements of AI agents.
- Implement advanced monitoring for cognitive processes and interactions.
- Expand security frameworks to accommodate agent identity and model routing as you scale deployments.
