# How to Use Git Branches for Beginners

Branches are an essential feature of Git that help developers keep their main codebase stable while experimenting or building new features. This guide from GitHub covers the basics for beginners:

## Why Use Branches?

- Protect the stability of your main code (usually `main` or `master` branch)
- Safely experiment with new features or fixes
- Collaborate with teammates on isolated changes

## Creating and Switching Branches

To create and switch to a new branch in one command, use:

```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```

This will:

- Create a new branch called `branch-name`
- Switch your working directory to that branch

## Viewing Branches

See a list of all your branches with:

```bash
git branch
```

- The branch with an asterisk `*` is your current active branch
- Use this to keep track of where you are and avoid confusion
