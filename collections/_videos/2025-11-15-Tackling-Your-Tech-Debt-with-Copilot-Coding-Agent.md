# Tackling Your Tech Debt with Copilot Coding Agent

**Speaker:** Brittany Ellich, Senior Software Engineer, GitHub

## Introduction: Tackling Technical Debt

Technical debt has traditionally been deprioritized in favor of customer-facing features, often resulting in legacy code maintenance challenges. With modern AI agents, developers now have tools to address tech debt efficiently.

## The Problem with Tech Debt Management

- Many improvement items are identified but rarely prioritized.
- Backlogs grow as tech debt accumulates, creating risks for future maintainability.

## Your New Accelerator: The Copilot Coding Agent

- GitHub Copilot coding agent acts as an AI partner within development workflows.
- Assign tech debt issues directly to Copilot for automated modernization and refactoring support.

## Demo: Assigning a Tech Debt Issue to Copilot

- Demonstrates the process of delegating specific backlog items to the Copilot agent.
- Showcases Copilot's ability to suggest improvements, refactor code, and modernize legacy logic.

## The WRAP Strategy for Eliminating Tech Debt

- Overview of the WRAP methodology to systematically address technical debt using AI:
  - **W**orkflow integration
  - **R**efactoring automation
  - **A**ssignment of issues
  - **P**rioritization with AI support

## A Developer's Daily Workflow with Copilot

- Developers interact with Copilot to:
  - Identify modernization opportunities
  - Receive intelligent suggestions for technical debt resolution
  - Automate routine code maintenance tasks

## Assign Your Backlog to Copilot

- How backlog grooming and issue assignment can be streamlined using Copilot.
- Empowers teams to keep the codebase agile and up to date without sacrificing customer enhancements.
