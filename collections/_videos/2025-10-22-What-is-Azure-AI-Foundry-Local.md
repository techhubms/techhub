# What is Azure AI Foundry Local?

**Presented by Dona Sarkar (Microsoft Developer)**

Azure AI Foundry Local is a new offering from Microsoft that enables organizations and developers to run AI models directly on their own hardware, rather than relying solely on cloud services. This approach is particularly beneficial for use cases where privacy, security, compliance, or network connectivity are primary concerns.

## Key Benefits

- **Privacy and Security:** By keeping AI workloads on-premises, organizations maintain tighter control over sensitive data and model outputs.
- **Offline and Edge Scenarios:** Supports running advanced AI models even where internet connectivity is intermittent, unavailable, or intentionally limited.
- **Flexibility:** Enables developers to choose between local or cloud execution of AI models based on requirements.

## Use Cases

- Healthcare, finance, and sectors with strict data residency needs
- Edge and IoT deployments requiring low-latency inference
- Environments with limited or no internet access
