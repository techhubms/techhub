# AI Agents and MCP in Production: Azure App Platform at Microsoft Ignite

**Speakers:** Devanshi Joshi, Nir Mashkowski, Jordan Selig, Jun Yoshida

## Session Overview

Explore how AI agents have become integral to production environments, leveraging the Azure App Platform for secure and scalable deployment. The session covers:

- Agent lifecycle management
- Integration of MCP (Managed Control Plane) tools
- Governance, observability, and policy enforcement for reliability

## Key Topics & Demonstrations

### Fundamentals: Apps, Agents, and MCP Tools

- Definitions and distinctions of apps, agents, and control plane solutions.
- Introduction to agent-based architectures using Azure and MCP.

### App Modernization with GitHub Copilot

- Live demonstration: Upgrading an application to .NET 10 using GitHub Copilot.
- Workflow improvements for developers incorporating Copilot into modernization efforts.

### AI Agent Operations & Tools

- Agents performing background operations: content moderation and Open API tool integration.
- Use of built-in observability and access controls for secure operations.

### Authentication & Security Enhancements

- Easy Auth support for MCP servers to strengthen authentication practices.
- Demo: Securely connecting to MCP servers from VS Code with authentication and policy controls.

### Developing AI Maintenance Agents

- Use of Azure AI Foundry and Agent Framework for creating maintenance agents.
- Demo: AI-guided maintenance applied to industrial scenarios (e.g., air compressors).

## Governance and Performance at Scale

- Strategies for managing agents, enforcing enterprise policies, and ensuring robust security.
- Policy enforcement and lifecycle best practices.

## Next Steps

- Summary: AI modernization journey, emphasis on security, and scalable governance.
