# Model Context Protocol: From Concept to Linux Foundation Agentic AI

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) began as an idea to connect AI models openly with tools, systems, and developer workflows. Featuring engineers and maintainers from Anthropic, GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI, this video tracks MCP’s rise into one of the fastest-growing open standards in AI.

## What Is MCP?

- **MCP** enables AI models to integrate seamlessly with developer tools and agent frameworks.
- Born from community-driven collaboration that prioritized openness from day one.

## The Open Standard Journey

- Shared stories from key contributors on why open standards are vital for scalable AI development.
- The protocol’s rapid adoption and evolution fueled by cross-industry cooperation.

## MCP Under the Linux Foundation

- MCP’s transition to the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation:
  - Strengthens vendor-neutral governance.
  - Encourages wider community engagement.
  - Supports long-term sustainability.
- Engineers discuss how this change empowers developers building advanced agents and AI-powered tools.

## Insights for Developers

- How MCP helps unify agent frameworks and tool integrations.
- Why the community’s support and transparent governance are central to MCP’s momentum.
- What developers can expect for building agentic applications in the MCP ecosystem.
