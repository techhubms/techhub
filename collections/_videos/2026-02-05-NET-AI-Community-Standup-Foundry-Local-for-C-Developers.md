# .NET AI Community Standup: Foundry Local for C# Developers

**Presented by:** Bruno Capuano, Maanav Dalal

**Overview:**
Modern .NET developers have the option to run powerful AI models locally, eliminating the need for cloud dependencies. Foundry Local enables C# and .NET developers to architect, run, and integrate AI solutions directly on their machines—providing advantages in speed, privacy, and control over the AI stack.

## Key Topics

- Introduction to Foundry Local and its fit within the .NET ecosystem
- Benefits of local-first AI for developers: faster iteration, improved privacy, and full control
- Architectural considerations for integrating Foundry Local with C# applications
- Example workflows for running and deploying local AI models
- Comparison with cloud-based AI approaches

## Practical Insights

- How to set up and use Foundry Local as a .NET developer
- Use cases: privacy-sensitive apps, development speed, offline scenarios
- Integration patterns for AI models in modern .NET solutions
