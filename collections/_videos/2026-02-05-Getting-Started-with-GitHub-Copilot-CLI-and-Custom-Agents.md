# Getting Started with GitHub Copilot CLI and Custom Agents

Presented by Kadesha from GitHub Developer Relations, this overview dives into:

- **GitHub Copilot CLI**: How to integrate AI into your terminal sessions for task automation, feature scaffolding, and error resolution.
- **Custom Agents**: Leveraging and configuring agents to tailor Copilot CLI functionality for your unique workflows.
- **MCP Servers**: Overview of how MCP servers connect Copilot CLI capabilities to broader development automation scenarios.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Directly automate common developer tasks with natural language in the terminal
- Scaffold features and resolve build errors without leaving the shell
- Extend and customize Copilot CLI through custom agents and MCP server integration
- Enhance productivity using AI-powered tools alongside traditional CLI utilities

**Try it Yourself:**
