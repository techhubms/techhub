# Leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in Visual Studio Code

**Presented by:** Visual Studio Code team

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to use external tools and services through a unified integration interface. This session demonstrates how developers can enhance their daily workflows in Visual Studio Code by connecting to MCP servers for additional capabilities.

## What is MCP?

- **Open Standard:** MCP provides a protocol for connecting AI models to various developer tools and external services.
- **Extensibility:** Allows integration for diverse tasks (file operations, database queries, API calls) directly from your development environment.

## Key Use Cases

- **File Operations:** Performing CRUD operations on files through integrated AI workflows.
- **Database Management:** Running database queries and managing schema using MCP-compliant tools.
- **API Interactions:** Calling external or internal APIs for automation, data processing, or service integration.
- **Unified Interface:** Centralized control via VS Code for streamlined productivity.
