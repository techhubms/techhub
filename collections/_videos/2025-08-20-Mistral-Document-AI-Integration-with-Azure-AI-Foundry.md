# Mistral Document AI Integration with Azure AI Foundry

Presented by **Microsoft Developer**

## Overview

In this episode, April demonstrates the capabilities of the Mistral Document AI model within **Azure AI Foundry**. The focus is on translating unstructured documents—such as PDFs with complex layouts and handwritten notes—into actionable, structured JSON data.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Deploying the Mistral Document AI model** within Azure AI Foundry
- **Accessing and running sample code** to process documents
- **Parsing PDFs and images** using base64 samples
- **Generating structured JSON outputs** for integration with various data systems
- **Connecting outputs to databases, AI agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows** to enable broader use cases

## Main Steps

1. **Deploy the Model:**  
   Start by deploying Mistral Document AI in your Azure AI Foundry workspace.
2. **Access Sample Code:**  
   Download example code to interact with the model (get the code [here](https://aka.ms/insideAIF/code)).
3. **Process Documents:**  
   - Run the model using a base64-encoded PDF to obtain structured outputs.  
   - Repeat the process for images, including handwritten notes.
4. **Review Outputs:**  
   Inspect the JSON output, which organizes extracted data for downstream integration.
5. **Integrate:**  
   Feed the structured data into your preferred databases, AI workflows, or RAG pipelines.
