# Unleash the Future of AI and Agents on Windows Backed by Security

## Session Overview

This session from Microsoft Ignite 2025 focuses on expanding Windows as a robust canvas for AI and agent-driven computing. Topics include the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Computer Using Agents (CUAs), technical deployment architectures, and new security models to support billions of specialized agents by 2028.

## Key Technical Topics

- **Agent Connectors and Registry**: Learn how agent connectors allow extensibility and secure interactions between agents, utilizing on-device registries and isolated workspaces for controlled execution.
- **Growth Projection**: Anticipates the existence of 1.3 billion active agents by 2028 and discusses specialized agent hierarchies for different use cases.
- **Platform Security Enhancements**: Reviews upcoming security guardrails, risk mitigations, and the need for agent packaging requirements reminiscent of early web security standards.
- **MCP Host Architecture**: Explains the host, client, and server interaction model enabling agent communication across the platform.
- **Technical Demo**: The 'Manus' demo illustrates agent deployment, isolated execution, and secure handling of agent operations on Windows.
- **Addressing Installation and Privacy**: Includes strategies to reduce installation friction and enhance user privacy in agent-enabled computing.
- **Microsoft Defender Integration**: Details plans for integrating device-level security and monitoring for agents via Microsoft Defender, with a focus on audience Q&A around device access concerns.
