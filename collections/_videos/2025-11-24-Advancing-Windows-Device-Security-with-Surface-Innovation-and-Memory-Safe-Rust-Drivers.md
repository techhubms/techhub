# Advancing Windows Device Security with Surface Innovation and Memory-Safe Rust Drivers

**Speakers**: David Abzarian, Karan Dhillon  
**Session**: Microsoft Ignite 2025, Breakout BRK338

## Overview

This session details Microsoft's approach to strengthening Windows device security, especially on Surface hardware, through innovative firmware engineering and collaborative development. Microsoft demonstrates a commitment to secure device platforms by embracing:

- Use of the Rust programming language for firmware and driver development
- Memory safety for reducing device vulnerabilities
- Open source projects enabling broad participation (including windows-drivers-rs)

## Session Chapters

### 1. Device-Level Security Insights

Get a comprehensive view of threats and protection strategies at the hardware and firmware level, with insight into modern Secure Core PC and hardware-based safeguards.

### 2. Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI)

Examine how organizations and IT teams can manage device firmware securely using DFCI, increasing control over device configuration and deployment.

### 3. Rust for Safer Driver and Firmware Development

- Introduction to Rust and its value as a memory-safe programming language
- How Surface leverages Rust for building secure Embedded Controllers and device drivers
- Launch of Cargo WDK, simplifying Rust driver setup for Windows

### 4. windows-drivers-rs Project and Open Device Partnership (ODP)

- Overview of the open-source windows-drivers-rs project for driver development in Rust
- Participation in the Open Device Partnership (ODP) to foster collaborative hardware and software security innovation

## Key Takeaways

- **Reduced Vulnerabilities**: Memory-safe Rust drivers prevent common memory issues (such as buffer overflows), directly reducing device attack surfaces.
- **Improved Reliability**: More secure and resilient hardware and firmware increase Windows platform trustworthiness.
- **Collaboration**: Microsoft invites IT and engineering communities to participate in open source projects and hardware/software partnerships to build safer technology ecosystems.
