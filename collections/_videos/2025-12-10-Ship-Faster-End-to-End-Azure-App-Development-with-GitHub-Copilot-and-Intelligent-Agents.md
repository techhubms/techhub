# Ship Faster: End-to-End Azure App Development with GitHub Copilot and Intelligent Agents

Presented by Microsoft Developer

## Overview

This session covers how developers can accelerate the entire application lifecycle on Azure by utilizing GitHub Copilot and a suite of purpose-built intelligent agents. Learn how these AI-powered tools help at every step, from planning and coding to deployment, diagnostics, and production operations.

## Topics Covered

- **Coding Agent**: Streamlines code writing and enforces best practices.
- **App Modernization Agent**: Accelerates updating legacy apps for cloud-native Azure deployments.
- **Cloud Architecture Agent**: Aids in planning and refining scalable, secure architecture for cloud apps.
- **GitHub Copilot for Azure**: Integrates Copilot capabilities directly into Azure workflows for code, deployment scripting, and configuration generation.
- **Azure MCP Server**: Simplifies deployment and enables more efficient diagnostics.
- **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Agent**: Monitors and automates operational tasks in production to maintain reliability.
- **Testing Agent**: Boosts quality assurance automation, reducing manual testing friction.

## End-to-End DevOps with AI

By integrating these agents alongside GitHub Copilot tooling, developers can:

- Plan features, solutions, and architecture using conversational interfaces
- Automate repetitive coding, configuration, and scripting tasks
- Deploy, monitor, and diagnose applications on Azure faster
- Extend automation and observability into production
