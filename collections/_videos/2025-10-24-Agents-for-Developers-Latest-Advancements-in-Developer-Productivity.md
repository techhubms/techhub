# Agents for Developers: Latest Advancements

In this session, Govind Kamtamneni presents the evolving world of developer agents, showcasing how these tools are rapidly expanding their capabilities. No longer limited to code suggestions, the new breed of agents can now perform tasks, fix issues, and enable an ecosystem of open source extensions.

## Key Highlights

- **Beyond Code Suggestions**: Agents can now handle complete tasks and even fix development issues autonomously, reducing manual effort for routine problems.

- **Open Source Ecosystem**: Introduction of open source extensions supports community-driven innovation and customizability for agent behavior and integrations.

- **SRE Agent**: Special focus on the SRE Agent capability, designed to enhance reliability engineering by automating issue remediation and supporting incident handling workflows.

- **Improved Developer Experience**: These upgrades streamline the daily workflow for developers, enabling greater productivity and less context switching.

- **Future Integrations**: The door is open for even greater flexibility, as further integrations and automation become available to the developer community.
