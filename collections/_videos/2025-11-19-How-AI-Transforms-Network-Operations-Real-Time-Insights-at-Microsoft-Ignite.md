# How AI Transforms Network Operations: From Theory to Reality

**Speaker:** Phillip Gervasi  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Session ID:** ODSP1420

---

## Introduction

AI is accelerating the evolution of network operations (NetOps), moving organizations past legacy scripted automation to intelligent, data-driven workflows. This session explores practical applications and the architecture needed to support modern, AI-powered NetOps.

---

## Key Topics Covered

- **Incident Triage:** AI enables faster, more accurate triage by analyzing network data in real-time, identifying anomalies, and prioritizing issues.
- **Knowledge Retrieval:** Leverages LLMs and NLP to search vast data repositories and documentation, reducing time to resolution.
- **Traffic Analysis and Prediction:** Machine learning models detect traffic patterns, forecast potential issues, and optimize resource allocation.
- **Monitoring Evolution:** Contrasts legacy monitoring systems with ML/NLP/LLM-powered analytics. New approaches support predictive and prescriptive capabilities.

---

## AI Architecture for NetOps

- **Solid Data Foundation:** Reliability begins with foundational data architecture that supports scalable, real-time workflows.
- **APIs and Integrations:** Accurate and timely data access through robust APIs is essential for automated and manual interventions.
- **Natural Language Interfaces:** Examples include converting user queries to SQL using NLP, allowing non-technical users to extract insights.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** RAG integrates external or hybrid network data for enhanced query results and knowledge graphs.
- **Agent Workflows:** Multi-agent systems collaborate for complex tasks and manage real-time insights across hybrid environments.

---

## MLOps and Data Pipelines

- **Data Pipelines:** Architecting scalable data ingestion, ETL, and monitoring processes enables robust ML model deployment in NetOps.
- **MLOps:** Strategies for model training, validation, deployment, and monitoring tailored to dynamic network environments.

---

## Practical Considerations

- **Build vs Buy:** Weighing the flexibility of custom solutions vs. the speed and reliability of vendor offerings when implementing AI infrastructure.
- **Accuracy and Reliability:** Addressing model performance, trustworthiness, and operational impact in high-stakes network contexts.
- **Cost and Compliance:** Managing operational expenses and meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., data privacy).
- **Human-in-the-Loop Guardrails:** Ensuring expert oversight for critical automation scenarios, balancing speed and control.
