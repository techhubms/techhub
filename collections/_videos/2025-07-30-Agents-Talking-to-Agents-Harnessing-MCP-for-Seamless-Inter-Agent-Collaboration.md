# Agents Talking to Agents: Harnessing MCP for Seamless Inter-Agent Collaboration

This session focuses on how multiple AI agents can collaborate by leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed and promoted by Microsoft. When two or more AI agents must coordinate—sharing context, delegating subtasks, and merging results—MCP acts as a standard handshake for interoperability.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is a specification that lets agents exchange schemas, explore tool catalogs, and interact via a registry, treating each other as remote servers. This universal interface eliminates the need for custom glue code, making agent collaboration seamless.

## Key Features of MCP

- **Schema Exchange**: Agents can understand each other’s input and output formats.
- **Tool Catalog**: Enables agents to discover each other’s capabilities.
- **Registry**: Facilitates directory and look-up services so agents can find and connect with peers.

## Integrations and Resources

- **VS Code Support**: Try MCP servers within Visual Studio Code: [VS Code MCP](https://code.visualstudio.com/mcp)
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Integrate MCP tools into custom agents using the Foundry Agent Service: [Announcing MCP Support Preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/announcing-model-context-protocol-support-preview-in-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service/)
- **Learn More**: Access the MCP beginner's curriculum: [https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners)
- **Community**: Join the discussion on Discord: [https://aka.ms/azureaifoundry/discord](https://aka.ms/azureaifoundry/discord)

## Use Cases

- Mazimizing agent interoperability in AI systems
- Automating multi-agent workflows without bespoke integration
- Expanding agent ecosystems with discoverable, plug-and-play capabilities
