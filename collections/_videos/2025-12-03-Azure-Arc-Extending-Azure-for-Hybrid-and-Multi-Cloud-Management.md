# Azure Arc: Extending Azure for Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Management

Presented by: Brendan Burns, Steven Bucher
Event: Microsoft Ignite 2025 (Session BRK183)

## Overview

Azure Arc brings Azure's powerful and unified management experience to environments beyond Azure, including on-premises datacenters and other cloud providers. This session delves into how organizations can achieve consistent governance, security, and operations across diverse platforms—bridging on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud setups.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Unified Management**: Use Azure Arc to manage resources across Azure, on-premises, and other clouds with the same tools and standards.
- **Governance and Security**: Apply Azure policies, compliance rules, and security controls universally, regardless of resource location.
- **Operational Consistency**: Centralize operational practices for monitoring, updates, and management of both Windows and Linux environments.
- **System Center Cloud-Native Journey**: Learn how legacy System Center customers can transition to cloud-native management models with Azure Arc.
- **Modernization Strategies**: Approaches for modernizing existing Windows/Linux workloads and adopting new cloud-native applications.
- **Management Agents and Tooling**: Utilize Azure Arc’s agents and toolsets to bridge the gap between traditional datacenter operations and modern cloud management solutions.

## Practical Benefits

- Gain a single point of management for servers, Kubernetes clusters, and applications running anywhere.
- Implement consistent security and compliance policies at scale.
- Increase agility in managing multi-cloud and hybrid environments while leveraging familiar Azure tools.
