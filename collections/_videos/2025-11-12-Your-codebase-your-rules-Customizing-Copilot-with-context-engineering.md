# Your codebase, your rules: Customizing Copilot with context engineering

**Speaker:** Harald Kirschner, Principal Product Manager, Microsoft

## Overview

This video delves into optimizing GitHub Copilot within Visual Studio Code by applying context engineering principles. Developers will gain insights into making Copilot more context-aware—tailoring it to not only their codebase, but team workflows and architectural patterns.

---

## Key Topics

- **Default Copilot Context in VS Code:**
  - Understand what Copilot “sees” out of the box and the scope of its context window.

- **Core Techniques**
  - Using custom instructions and prompt engineering to refine Copilot’s output for specific projects.
  - Applying Plan Mode and context engineering to adapt Copilot’s responses to your workflow.

- **Example Workflow**
  - How to implement a custom test-driven development (TDD) flow using Copilot and context customization.

- **Scaling Context Engineering Enterprise-Wide**
  - Frameworks for implementing context-aware practices across large codebases and teams with Copilot Enterprise.
  - Ready-to-use templates for sharing project-wide context and standardized instruction sets.

- **Getting Started**
  - Practical recommendations for enabling advanced Copilot features in enterprise environments and setting up your context framework.
