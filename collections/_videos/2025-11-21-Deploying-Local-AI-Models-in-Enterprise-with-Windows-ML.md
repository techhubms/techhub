# Deploying Local AI Models in Enterprise with Windows ML

**Session Speakers:** Andrew Leader, Anastasiya Tarnouskaya
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 (Session BRK329)

## Overview

Windows ML is an advanced AI framework built directly into Windows, supporting secure and private on-device AI inferencing. This session explores why deploying models locally is vital for privacy, security, and performance—eliminating the need for cloud infrastructure.

## Key Topics

- **Benefits of Local AI:**
  - Enhanced privacy and data security by keeping inferencing on-device
  - Faster response times due to reduced latency
  - Scalable solutions across diverse hardware tiers
- **Windows ML Architecture:**
  - Abstracts complex model-to-hardware operations for developers
  - Supports execution on CPU, GPU, and NPU
  - Helps manage dependencies, minimizing app size and deployment risks
- **Registering Execution Providers:**
  - Demonstrated use of ONNX Runtime for model execution
  - How to select and debug execution providers (including QNN NPU support)
  - Step-by-step: Register providers and ensure device readiness
- **Model Setup and Prompt Encoding:**
  - Encoding prompts for local generation
  - Setting up model generators for various tasks
  - Example: Live GPU-based image generation demo using Windows ML
- **Deployment and Flexibility:**
  - Windows ML enables lightweight deployments that scale from CPU to NPU
  - Comparison of inference performance on different hardware
- **Developer Experience:**
  - Focus on app logic while the framework handles hardware abstraction
  - Tools and best practices for debugging and readiness
