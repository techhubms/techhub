# How AI Influences Programming Language Selection

In this video, Idan Gazit explores why TypeScript is experiencing a significant surge in popularity and how artificial intelligence impacts developer choices of programming languages.

## AI’s Effect on Language Popularity

Gazit describes a "self-reinforcing cycle" where developers increasingly prefer languages that AI models handle well. As more developers adopt a language, it receives more support from AI code generators, further encouraging adoption.

## The Importance of Static Typing

Statically typed languages, such as TypeScript, provide essential guardrails that help ensure the correctness of AI-generated code. This reliability makes them especially attractive in AI-assisted development environments, keeping code "on the rails" and reducing the chance of runtime errors.

## Key Points Covered

- Why TypeScript and other statically typed languages are thriving in the AI era
- The relationship between AI model training and language usability
- How AI feedback loops encourage best practices and standardization in language adoption
- Developer perspectives on code generation and reliability
