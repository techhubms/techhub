# Building Intelligent AI Applications with Java, Spring Boot, and LangChain4j

**Presenters:** Ayan Gupta (Microsoft) and Julien Dubois (Microsoft Java Developer Advocacy, LangChain4j core contributor)

## Introduction

Modern applications increasingly require adaptive intelligence, similar to how a smart mug reacts to temperature changes. This video introduces Java developers to the process of building AI-powered apps using LangChain4j, Spring Boot, GitHub Copilot, and Azure services.

## Key Learning Points

- **LangChain4j Overview:** Learn why LangChain4j is a preferred framework for Java-based AI integration, offering a unified interface to various LLM providers.
- **Getting Started:** Project setup via [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/), configuration with Maven (Java 24), and running a basic Spring Boot application.
- **Feature Addition:** Use GitHub Copilot to quickly add a `CommandLineRunner` for command-line interactivity.
- **Manual User Input Testing:** Understand how to test non-AI functionality before integration.

## Integrating AI Capabilities

- **Dependency Management:** Utilize Maven's Bill of Materials (BOM) for cleaner management of LangChain4j dependencies across modules.
- **OpenAI SDK Integration:** Choose and add the official OpenAI Java SDK as an LLM backend with LangChain4j.
- **Configuring Chat Models:** Connect your application to Azure AI Foundry and GPT-4o Mini, specifying the base URL, API key, and model name for the chat model.
- **Unified LLM Interface:** Demonstrated usage of the ChatModel interface, which can be pointed at various LLM implementations (OpenAI, Mistral, Llama, or GitHub Models) without code rewrites.

## Practical Demonstration

- **Step-by-Step Demo:**
  - Add required dependencies with Maven.
  - Configure chat model for Azure AI Foundry integration.
  - Retrieve and set up API keys and endpoints.
  - Craft and test an AI-powered poem generator in Spring Boot.
  - Recap session takeaways and next steps for further exploration.
