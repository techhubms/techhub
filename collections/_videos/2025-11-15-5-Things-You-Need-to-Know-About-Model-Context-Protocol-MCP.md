# 5 Things You Need to Know About Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**Presented by Visual Studio Code — Featuring Chris Noring**

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a new standard built to make it easier for Agents (such as those in Visual Studio Code) to find and share features, including tools, prompt resources, and more. This video serves as a quick guide to understanding MCP's key aspects:

## What is MCP?

- Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for agents and extensions in tools like VS Code to exchange information about available features, resources, and prompts.

## Why does MCP matter?

- It enables consistent discovery and interoperability among AI-powered agents and extensions, making new tools and resources easily accessible to developers.

## Key Benefits

- Simplifies sharing of prompts and resources between agents
- Fosters a collaborative and extensible ecosystem in development tools
- Drives innovation by reducing friction in feature discovery

## Getting Started

- Beginners can refer to the official Microsoft link: [MCP for Beginners](https://aka.ms/mcp-for-beginners)

## Learn More

- Chris Noring explains the background and demonstrated uses in the video.
- Explore how MCP connects tools and resources for enhanced development workflows.
- Recommended for developers interested in VS Code, agent-based features, and prompt engineering.
