# Prototyping Game Environments in Godot C# with CSG Nodes

In this episode of the Godot C# training series, you'll learn practical techniques for using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) nodes to rapidly build and iterate 3D game environments.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Prototyping in Game Development**: Why early layout and fast iteration are important for testing gameplay and flow.
- **Using CSG Nodes**: Learn how to block out a room with CSG primitives, enabling rapid scene prototyping.
- **Snapping & Transform Tools**: Discover how to set up and use snapping and transform utilities for precise placement of geometry.
- **Collision Detection**: Steps for applying collision settings to your CSG shapes, ensuring interactive objects detect the environment properly.
- **CSG Operations**: Utilize union, intersection, and subtraction to shape your environments. Example: cut a door into a wall using subtraction.
- **CSG Combiner Node**: Combine multiple shapes for cleaner scene management and easier editing.
- **Performance Tips**: Advice on efficiently prototyping with CSG and optimizing for large scenes.
- **Best Practices**: Tips for layout, flow, and iteration before committing to finalized models and textures.

## Hands-On Challenge

Expand your scene by adding a second room and block out furniture such as tables and chairs, focusing on navigation and interactive flow.
