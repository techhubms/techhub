# Optimize Complex Workflows with Multi-Agent AI Patterns in Azure

**Presented by:** Thomas Maurer & Clayton Siemens, Microsoft

## Overview

This episode of the Azure Essentials Show explores how multi-agent AI orchestration in Microsoft Azure can be used to solve complex enterprise workflow challenges. The discussion moves beyond simple information retrieval, highlighting the business value of coordinated AI agent actions and automation.

## Key Takeaways

- **LLMs vs. SLMs:**
  - *Large language models (LLMs)* provide broad capabilities, but *small, specialized language models (SLMs)* are often preferred for targeted enterprise tasks.
  - Specialization leads to better performance and relevance for specific business scenarios.

- **Orchestration Patterns:**
  - **Sequential:** Tasks handled in a set order (e.g., data collection → enrichment → report generation).
  - **Concurrent:** Multiple agents operate simultaneously, parallelizing subtasks for efficiency.
  - **Group Chat:** Agents collaborate as a team to reach shared decisions or synthesize insights.
  - **Hand-off:** Control and context pass between agents, allowing for modular, dynamic task delegation.

- **Enterprise Impact:**
  - Agentic AI can significantly enhance agility, scalability, and governance in enterprise automation workflows.
  - Proper pattern selection is crucial—choose multi-agent architectures for complex, interdependent tasks over simple single-agent solutions.
