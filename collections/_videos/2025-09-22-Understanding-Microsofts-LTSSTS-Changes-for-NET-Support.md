# Understanding Microsoft's LTS/STS Changes for .NET Support

**Author:** Nick Chapsas

## Overview

In this video, Nick Chapsas explains the recent changes Microsoft introduced to the lifecycle support of .NET. He discusses the difference between LTS (Long-Term Support) and STS (Standard-Term Support), what the new support updates mean, and how they address longstanding issues .NET developers have raised.

## .NET Lifecycle: The Issue

- **Historical Concern:** Developers have been concerned about the short lifecycle of certain .NET versions, which leads to faster upgrades and overhead for maintenance.
- **LTS vs STS:** Traditionally, LTS releases get longer support, while STS releases are supported for a short period. This model often caused confusion and forced frequent migrations for some teams.

## What Microsoft Changed

- **Recent Announcement:** Microsoft has adjusted its LTS and STS lifecycle models to address developer feedback and simplify support expectations.
- **Key Improvements:**
  - Clearer definition of support periods for LTS and STS.
  - Simplified upgrade paths.
  - More predictable timelines, making it easier for developers to plan upgrades.

## Why This Matters

- **Predictability:** Teams can now plan for upgrades more confidently.
- **Stability:** Longer and better-defined lifecycles reduce technical debt associated with hasty migrations.
- **Community Impact:** Addresses one of the most common pain points among .NET developers regarding support timelines.
