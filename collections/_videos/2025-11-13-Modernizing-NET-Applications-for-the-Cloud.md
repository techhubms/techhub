# Modernizing .NET Applications for the Cloud

Modernizing .NET applications is critical for organizations looking to leverage the scalability and agility of cloud platforms. This session outlines:

## Key Topics

- **Assessing Modernization Candidates:** Evaluate existing .NET Framework and older .NET Core applications for cloud migration suitability.
- **Incremental Updates:** Approach modernization step by step, reducing risk while introducing improvements.
- **Containerization:** Package legacy workloads with containers for enhanced portability and deployment flexibility.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture Patterns:** Adopt patterns such as microservices, service discovery, and scalability practices to make applications resilient and scalable.
- **Leveraging Azure Services:** Utilize Azure features including App Service, Azure Functions, Azure Container Apps, and related cloud-native services to enhance existing apps.
- **Migration Planning and Execution:** Use proven assessment tools and migration frameworks for successful transformation.
