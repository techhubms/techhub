# Foundry Control Plane: Managing AI Agents at Scale

Presented at Microsoft Ignite 2025 by Mehrnoosh Sameki, Peter Simones, and Jaspreet Singh, this session offers a deep dive into the operational challenges and best practices of managing scalable AI agents with Microsoft Foundry and Azure AI.

## Key Topics

- **Operational AI Agent Management:** Transitioning from building conceptual agents to managing large-scale operational fleets.
- **Responsible AI Practices:** Addressing industry trust gaps revealed in recent KPMG studies and implementing compliance-focused solutions.
- **Foundry Control Plane Features:** Integrating safety, guardrails, and compliance directly into deployment workflows for peace of mind.
- **Policy and Update Management:** Setting policies for AI agent behavior and rolling out system-wide updates efficiently.
- **Security and Guardrails:** Validating PII prevention, leveraging built-in safety features, and incorporating custom security integrations ('bring your own security').
- **Red Teaming and Risk Mitigation:** Running simulated attack scenarios, defining risk categories, and customizing prohibited actions for stronger defenses.
- **Governance and Standardization:** Tackling governance and standardization challenges in the evolving ecosystem of agentic AI systems.

## Session Chapters
