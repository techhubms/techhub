# Code & Community with Copilot CLI

GitHub has announced the general availability of **GitHub Copilot CLI**, presenting a live session featuring Ryan Hecht. This video offers a practical breakdown of the tool's features and how developers can use it in real scenarios.

## Overview

- **Copilot CLI** is an agentic AI assistant that operates directly within your terminal.
- More than a basic code suggestion tool, Copilot CLI integrates:
  - Specialized built-in agents for exploring codebases
  - Task execution and planning
  - Step-by-step implementation planning
  - Code review and collaborative workflows
- Operates both with user interaction (approval for each step) or autonomously, providing flexibility for diverse workflows.

## Key Features

- **Codebase Exploration**: Navigate and understand large codebases efficiently.
- **Task Automation**: Run and manage development tasks without leaving the CLI.
- **Implementation Planning**: Receive guided step-by-step plans for building features or fixing bugs.
- **Code Review**: Review proposed changes or get quick feedback on code quality and standards.
- **Agentic Interaction**: Choose between stepwise approval or autonomous task completion, adapting to your preferred development style.

## How Developers Benefit

- **Terminal-Centric Workflow**: All features are accessible from the terminal, reducing the need to switch environments.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Automates repetitive tasks, accelerates code review, and improves code quality.
- **Live Demonstration**: Ryan Hecht showcases real-world scenarios and tips on maximizing Copilot CLI's potential in development routines.

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot CLI represents a significant step in developer tooling, bringing AI-powered assistance directly into the command-line interface. Its agentic design and depth of task support provide developers with hands-on ways to streamline their workflow, enhance productivity, and focus on complex problem-solving.
