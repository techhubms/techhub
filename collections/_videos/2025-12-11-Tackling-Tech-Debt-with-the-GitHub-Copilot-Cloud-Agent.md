# Tackling Tech Debt with the GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent

**Speaker:** Microsoft Developer

## Overview

Managing technical debt has always been a challenge, often relegated to the backlog and rarely prioritized over direct customer enhancements. With recent advances in AI, particularly the introduction of agents like [GitHub Copilot Cloud Agent](https://github.com/features/preview/copilot), development teams can now more easily modernize and refactor their codebases, preventing the risk of legacy stagnation.

## Key Topics Covered

- **The Traditional Tech Debt Challenge:**
  - Technical debt often gets deprioritized, causing long-term maintenance issues.
- **The AI Agent Paradigm Shift:**
  - AI-powered agents, such as GitHub Copilot, allow teams to identify, modernize, and refactor code with less manual effort.
  - The process of embracing and accelerating legacy software modernization using Copilot Cloud Agent.
- **Practical Benefits:**
  - Automated code suggestions for refactoring.
  - Modernization of outdated patterns and dependencies.
  - Ensuring the codebase remains maintainable and easy to evolve.
- **Developer Experience:**
  - Integrating AI tools with developer workflows in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
  - Real-world demonstrations of Copilot Cloud Agent in action.
