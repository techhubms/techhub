# VS Code Live: Exploring MCP Apps Integration

In this live session, Den Delimarsky, Harald Kirschner, and James Montemagno delve into the capabilities of MCP (Model Context Protocol) Apps now available in Visual Studio Code. MCP Apps enhance how developers build and render user interfaces within VS Code, streamlining workflows and enabling new integration patterns.

## What Are MCP Apps?

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A new protocol designed to improve interaction between tools, models, and VS Code.
- **MCP Apps**: Applications or extensions leveraging MCP for richer UI rendering and context-driven development experiences in the editor.

## Key Topics Covered

- **How to Get Started**: Quick start guidance and documentation ([MCP Apps are live](https://aka.ms/MCPApps))
- **VS Code Support**: Details on integrating and supporting MCP Apps in VS Code ([Support blog](https://aka.ms/MCPApps/Blog))
- **Rendering UI with MCP**: Demonstration of dynamic UI rendering capabilities and what this means for software developers ([Demo/YouTube](https://aka.ms/MCPApps/YT))
- **Developer Experience**: Enhanced productivity and streamlined workflows with MCP Apps.

## Presenters

- **Den Delimarsky** ([bsky.app profile](https://bsky.app/profile/den.dev))
- **Harald Kirschner** (@digitarald)
- **James Montemagno** (@JamesMontemagno)

## Why It Matters

- MCP Apps represent a significant step forward for extensibility and UI development in VS Code.
- Developers can now create richer, context-aware editing experiences informed by live models and protocols.
