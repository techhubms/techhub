# Secure by Design: Upcoming CMK and Auditing Features in Fabric SQL Database

Microsoft Developer presents an in-depth look at upcoming security enhancements for Fabric SQL Database, focusing on two major features: Customer-Managed Keys (CMK) and auditing.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK):**
  - Grant organizations full control over database encryption keys
  - Enable compliance with regulatory requirements and maintain data sovereignty
  - Integrated into Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
  - Demonstrations of configuration and practical use

- **Auditing for Fabric SQL Database:**
  - Provides visibility into database activity
  - Supports security and regulatory needs by tracking key actions and changes
  - Discusses auditing capabilities, configuration access control, and implementation best practices
  - Demo showcasing audit setup and reviewing collected audit data

## Detailed Breakdown

- **What is Customer-Managed Key (CMK):**
  - CMK empowers organizations to create, control, and manage encryption keys used in their Fabric SQL Database.
  - Enhances security by storing keys in a secure vault, often integrated with Azure Key Vault for centralized management.

- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):**
  - Provides at-rest data encryption for all database files
  - TDE with CMK enables organizations to meet compliance mandates for key ownership and rotation

- **Auditing Features:**
  - Records user activity and database operations
  - Helps organizations monitor for potential security incidents or compliance breaches
  - Key capabilities include detailed access logging, customizable auditing policies, and integration with security monitoring solutions

## Compliance and Data Sovereignty

- Both features addressed in the episode are essential for organizations with strict compliance and data protection requirements.
- Customer-Managed Keys ensure that data encryption keys are never accessible to unauthorized parties, supporting sovereignty mandates.
- Auditing delivers evidence of security best practices and supports regulatory attestation.

## Demo Highlights

- Step-by-step walkthroughs for enabling CMK and auditing on Fabric SQL Database
- Insights into best practices for configuration, access control, and ongoing management
