# Orchestrating GitHub Actions Pipelines in C# with Cake SDK

DevOps workflows increasingly rely on configuration as code, with YAML and JSON dominating the landscape. This session reimagines build and release orchestration by harnessing C# and the Cake SDK to author GitHub Actions pipelines.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Build and Release as Code:** Use C# for pipeline logic, replacing traditional markup languages.
- **Expressive Programming:** Access standard C# control structures (for, while, do), making complex workflows easier to read and maintain.
- **Debugging and Local Testing:** Develop and test pipelines locally with robust debugging, minimizing time spent waiting for CI cycles in GitHub.
- **Familiar Developer Tools:** Integrate with Visual Studio Code and other popular IDEs, letting teams leverage their C# skills and existing tooling.
- **Cake SDK Integration:** Use the Cake SDK for scripting and task automation within .NET 10 environments.

## Advantages

- **Improved Developer Experience:** Reduce context switching by using a familiar language.
- **Enhanced Testability:** Validate builds locally before pushing to GitHub.
- **Reusability and Maintainability:** Write modular, testable, and maintainable pipeline logic using C# features.

## Example Features

- Define pipeline steps using C# methods
- Implement error handling with exception logic
- Utilize loops and conditional flows for build orchestration
- Debug with full IDE support

## Getting Started

1. Install Cake SDK in your .NET 10 project
2. Set up build scripts in C# for GitHub Actions workflows
3. Debug and test workflows locally using VS Code
4. Push finalized pipeline logic to GitHub for CI/CD
