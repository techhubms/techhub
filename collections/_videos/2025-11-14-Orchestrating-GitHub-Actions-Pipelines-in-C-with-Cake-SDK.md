title: "Orchestrating GitHub Actions Pipelines in C# with Cake SDK"
description: "This session explores how developers can build and release DevOps pipelines for GitHub Actions by writing configuration as code using C# and the Cake SDK. Instead of relying on YAML or JSON markup, developers utilize the expressive features of C#, including control flow, structured logic, and debugging capabilities within familiar IDEs like Visual Studio Code. The approach leverages .NET 10 for enhanced build orchestration, enabling local testing, reducing CI cycle times, and allowing teams to reuse their existing language expertise for DevOps workflows."

# Orchestrating GitHub Actions Pipelines in C# with Cake SDK

DevOps workflows increasingly rely on configuration as code, with YAML and JSON dominating the landscape. This session reimagines build and release orchestration by harnessing C# and the Cake SDK to author GitHub Actions pipelines.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Build and Release as Code:** Use C# for pipeline logic, replacing traditional markup languages.
- **Expressive Programming:** Access standard C# control structures (for, while, do), making complex workflows easier to read and maintain.
- **Debugging and Local Testing:** Develop and test pipelines locally with robust debugging, minimizing time spent waiting for CI cycles in GitHub.
- **Familiar Developer Tools:** Integrate with Visual Studio Code and other popular IDEs, letting teams leverage their C# skills and existing tooling.
- **Cake SDK Integration:** Use the Cake SDK for scripting and task automation within .NET 10 environments.

## Advantages

- **Improved Developer Experience:** Reduce context switching by using a familiar language.
- **Enhanced Testability:** Validate builds locally before pushing to GitHub.
- **Reusability and Maintainability:** Write modular, testable, and maintainable pipeline logic using C# features.

## Example Features

- Define pipeline steps using C# methods
- Implement error handling with exception logic
- Utilize loops and conditional flows for build orchestration
- Debug with full IDE support

## Getting Started

1. Install Cake SDK in your .NET 10 project
2. Set up build scripts in C# for GitHub Actions workflows
3. Debug and test workflows locally using VS Code
4. Push finalized pipeline logic to GitHub for CI/CD
