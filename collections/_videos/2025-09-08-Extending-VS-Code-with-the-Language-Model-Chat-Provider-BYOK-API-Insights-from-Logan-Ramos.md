  - BYOK stands for 'Bring Your Own Key' or 'Bring Your Own Model,' referring to the new ability for users and extenders to configure and incorporate custom language models into their VS Code environment.
- **Supported Providers**
  - The API supports seamless integration of models from Azure, OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, Google, among others.
- **Features of the BYOK API**
  - Allows extension authors to leverage any compatible chat model directly in VS Code.
  - Offers flexibility for developers to use models that best suit their workflow or organization’s requirements.
- **Why Use the BYOK API?**
  - Facilitates AI development within the familiar VS Code interface.
  - Gives users more control over which models and endpoints they use, potentially improving privacy and compliance.
- **Technical Guidance for Extenders**
  - The episode walks through how builders can get started integrating their own models.
  - Links to samples, API documentation, and extension guides are provided for deeper technical exploration.
