- **Features of the BYOK API**
  - Allows extension authors to leverage any compatible chat model directly in VS Code.
  - Offers flexibility for developers to use models that best suit their workflow or organization’s requirements.
- **Why Use the BYOK API?**
  - Facilitates AI development within the familiar VS Code interface.
  - Gives users more control over which models and endpoints they use, potentially improving privacy and compliance.
