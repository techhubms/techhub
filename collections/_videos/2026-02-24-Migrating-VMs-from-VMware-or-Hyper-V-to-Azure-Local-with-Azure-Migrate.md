# Migrating VMs from VMware or Hyper-V to Azure Local with Azure Migrate

In this session, Microsoft Developer demonstrates how to move virtual machines (VMs) from VMware or Hyper-V to Azure Local by leveraging Azure Migrate. The session includes:

## Key Steps Covered

- **Configuring the Azure Migrate Project**: Setting up the Azure environment to receive migrated workloads.
- **Deploying Azure Migrate Appliance**: Installing the necessary on-premises appliance for discovery and assessment.
- **Synchronization Setup**: Enabling and configuring synchronization to ensure current data is available during migration.
- **Migration Execution**: Running the migration process from the source platform (VMware/Hyper-V) to Azure Local.
- **Final Cutover**: Completing the migration with minimal downtime, finalizing state, and ensuring operational readiness.

## Benefits Highlighted

- **Short Downtime**: Techniques to minimize service interruption during migration.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Migration performed without the need for expensive third-party tools.

This walkthrough is designed to help practitioners understand the full lifecycle of migrating VMs to Azure Local environments, providing actionable steps for a seamless transition.
