# Agent HQ for VS Code: Local, Cloud, and Background Agents

Agent HQ has received a major upgrade in Visual Studio Code, now allowing developers to manage local, cloud, and background agents all in a single view. This video, featuring Kyle Daigle, covers how Agent HQ streamlines the process of delegating coding tasks to the most suitable agent.

## Key Highlights

- **Unified Chat View**: Track every agent session and review related code changes using the Chat view.
- **GitHub Copilot Integration**: Leverage Copilot within agent sessions for smarter code suggestions and enhanced productivity.

## Workflow Improvements
