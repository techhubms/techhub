# Agent HQ for VS Code: Local, Cloud, and Background Agents

Agent HQ has received a major upgrade in Visual Studio Code, now allowing developers to manage local, cloud, and background agents all in a single view. This video, featuring Kyle Daigle, covers how Agent HQ streamlines the process of delegating coding tasks to the most suitable agent.

## Key Highlights

- **Centralized Agent Management**: Initiate and oversee agent sessions from one place in VS Code.
- **Agent Types**: Manage local agents (working on your machine), cloud agents (remotely hosted), and background agents simultaneously.
- **Unified Chat View**: Track every agent session and review related code changes using the Chat view.
- **GitHub Copilot Integration**: Leverage Copilot within agent sessions for smarter code suggestions and enhanced productivity.

## Workflow Improvements

- Seamless assignment and monitoring of tasks to specialized agents
- Immediate visibility into code changes and session progress
- Enhanced coding efficiency via Copilot
