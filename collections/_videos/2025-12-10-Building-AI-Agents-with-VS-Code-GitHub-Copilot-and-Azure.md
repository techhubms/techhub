# Building AI Agents with VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and Azure

In this session, you'll learn to prototype, trace, and deploy an AI agent using the latest integrations available in Visual Studio Code. The workflow includes:

## Workflow Overview

- Starting with a prototype setup powered by GitHub Copilot.
- Connecting Copilot to the AI Toolkit via an MCP server.
- Using Copilot to:
  - Suggest appropriate models
  - Open and use the model playground
  - Instrument code for detailed tracing
  - Enable trace viewing to monitor agent actions
- Deploying the agent to Azure and verifying end-to-end functionality

## Step-by-Step Key Topics

1. **VS Code & GitHub Copilot Integration**
    - Setting up Copilot extensions
    - Using Copilot suggestions in conjunction with the AI Toolkit

2. **Connecting to AI Toolkit via MCP**
    - Establishing a connection to the local MCP server
    - Using the toolkit to manage and test models

3. **Prototyping and Instrumentation**
    - Building the initial agent with Copilot-powered code generation
    - Instrumenting the agent's code for tracing

4. **Trace Viewing**
    - Enabling and interacting with trace outputs to monitor agent behavior

5. **Deployment to Azure**
    - Preparing deployment scripts and configuration
    - Using Azure resources to host and operate the agent

6. **Repeatable Workflow**
    - Steps for moving from local prototyping to full cloud deployment
    - Recommendations on how to maintain and improve agents post-deployment
