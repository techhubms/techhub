# You open sourced WSL. What does that mean?

**Presenter:** Craig Loewen (Microsoft Developer)

Microsoft has open sourced the core components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This significant update lets developers and enthusiasts:

- **Inspect and Learn:** Access the core code that enables features such as starting virtual machines, mounting file systems, GPU access, and managing interrupts on Windows via WSL.
- **Contribute:** The community is now able to review, suggest improvements, and contribute directly to the WSL codebase on GitHub ([WSL Repository](https://msft.it/6056sw6zO)).
- **Transparency:** Open sourcing gives more visibility into the internals of how Linux runs on Windows, promoting greater openness and collaboration.

Key discussion points include:

- What open sourcing WSL means practically for developers and IT professionals.
- Opportunities for building new features, customizing behaviors, or simply understanding how WSL operates under the hood.
- How the change could accelerate innovation around virtualization and Linux integration on Windows.

Whether you are a developer, an open source advocate, or new to WSL, this video helps you understand why this step matters and how you can get involved.

## Useful Resources

- [WSL GitHub Repository](https://msft.it/6056sw6zO)
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/)

## Next Steps

- Explore the codebase
- Participate in discussions and pull requests
- Build your own projects using or extending WSL

**What will you build with open source WSL?**
