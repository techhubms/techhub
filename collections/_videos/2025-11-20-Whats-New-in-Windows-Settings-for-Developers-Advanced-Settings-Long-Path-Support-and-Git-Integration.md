# What's New with Windows Settings for Developers?

**Presented by:** Kayla Cinnamon

Windows continues to evolve as a productive environment for developers. In this presentation, Kayla Cinnamon highlights the latest features coming to Windows Settings that are designed to improve the developer experience:

## Major Updates

- **Redesigned Advanced Settings Page**  
  A new layout streamlines access to advanced configuration options for developers, making it easier to find and adjust key development settings.

- **Long File Path Support**  
  Windows now natively supports long file paths, allowing developers to work with deeply nested directories and lengthy file names without running into legacy limits.

- **Git Integration in File Explorer**  
  Developers can now interact with Git repositories directly from Windows File Explorer, simplifying source control management without needing to switch context to the command line or another app.

## Availability

All of these updates are now generally available (GA) to Windows users.

## Why This Matters for Developers

These improvements help create a more seamless development experience on Windows by reducing friction when managing files, configuring environments, and handling source control.
