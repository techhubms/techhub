# GitHub Introduces Agentic Workflows: AI Agents for Automation

GitHub has announced support for agentic workflows, representing a new way to automate developer tasks directly through AI-powered agents.

## What Are Agentic Workflows?

- **User Experience**: Users describe the task or workflow in a simple markdown file.
- **Automation**: This markdown description is compiled into a GitHub Actions workflow, automating tasks that previously required manual configuration.
- **AI Agent Integration**: Any compatible AI agent—such as GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or OpenAI Codex—can interpret and execute these workflows, enabling intelligent automation on the GitHub platform.

## Key Features & Benefits

- **Democratized Automation**: Lower barrier for developers by leveraging markdown for workflow instructions rather than complex YAML or scripting.
- **Flexible Agent Support**: Works with a range of AI agents, not limited to GitHub Copilot, expanding automation and assistant options.
- **Integration with Existing GitHub Ecosystem**: Runs through GitHub Actions, supporting existing CI/CD and automation practices.

## Example Flow

1. Developer describes a task in markdown (e.g., CI build, deployment steps).
2. The agent processes and compiles it into a production-ready GitHub Actions workflow.
3. The workflow is executed, potentially involving multiple agents or fallback strategies.

## Supported AI Agents

- **GitHub Copilot**: Integrated developer assistant for workflow creation and execution.
- **Claude Code**: Third-party AI code agent.
- **OpenAI Codex**: Language model for translating natural language to code.
