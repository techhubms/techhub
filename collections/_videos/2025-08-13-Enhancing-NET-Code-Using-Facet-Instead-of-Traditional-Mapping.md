# Enhancing .NET Code: Using Facet Instead of Traditional Mapping

**Presenter:** Nick Chapsas

## Overview

Nick Chapsas introduces Facet, a library designed to replace traditional object mappers in .NET. Facet aims to provide developers with a more effective and performant way to map and project data, leveraging typed LINQ projections without incurring the typical overhead associated with mapping libraries.

## Key Points

- **Facet Library:** An open source library that utilizes strongly-typed LINQ projections to perform efficient object mapping in .NET applications.
- **Traditional Mapping Challenges:** Standard mapping approaches (using libraries or manual code) can add unnecessary complexity and runtime overhead.
- **How Facet Improves the Process:**
  - Eliminates the need for boilerplate mapping code.
  - Offers compile-time type checking via LINQ.
  - Enhances performance by leveraging direct projections.
- **GitHub Repository:** [Facet on GitHub](https://github.com/Tim-Maes/Facet)
- **Community Call to Action:** Nick encourages developers to star the Facet repository on GitHub if they find the project useful.

## Practical Benefits

- **Cleaner Code:** Reduces manual mapping code and potential errors.
- **Better Performance:** Avoids overhead associated with runtime mapping.
- **Modern Development Approach:** Encourages the use of LINQ and modern .NET features.

## Conclusion

The video provides an overview of how adopting Facet for data projection and mapping can improve .NET development practices, offering both performance benefits and a more maintainable codebase.
