# Envision Next Generation DLP with Microsoft Purview and Copilot

## Overview

This Ignite 2025 session explores how organizations can overcome legacy data loss prevention (DLP) challenges using Microsoft Purview and AI-driven tools like Security Copilot. It addresses common pitfalls with traditional DLP programs—such as excessive alerts and ineffective enforcement—and highlights new approaches that emphasize proactive controls, governance, and simplified user experience.

## Key Topics

- **Problems with Legacy DLP**: Limitations of older DLP implementations, including alert fatigue, resource strain, and lack of true enforcement.
- **Case Study**: Example of modernizing DLP using Microsoft Purview to integrate policies, executive alignment, and procedure improvements.
- **Governance and Policy**: Establishing organization-wide policies that transform oversharing into intentional sharing.
- **Automated Data Protection**: Leveraging Microsoft Purview to automate policy enforcement and close loopholes in data protection strategies.
- **AI and Security Copilot Integration**: How combining Microsoft Purview with Security Copilot enables near-autonomous data protection and incident response, even with limited human resources.
- **Session Speakers**: Adam Ames, Nick Caromano, Josh Rattan (PwC and Microsoft).
