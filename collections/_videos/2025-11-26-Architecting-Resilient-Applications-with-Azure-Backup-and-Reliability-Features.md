# Architecting Resilient Applications with Azure Backup and Reliability Features

**Speakers:** Gargi Banerjee, Surya Sripathi Raju
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 | BRK148

## Overview

This advanced session showcases how to leverage Azure's robust backup and reliability capabilities to architect resilient, secure applications and infrastructure. Topics include strengthening zonal resiliency, assessing and validating resilience across VMs, databases, and containers, and leveraging advanced tools for data and cyber resiliency.

## Key Topics

- **Zonal Resiliency:** Techniques to strengthen availability and resilience for critical workloads across Azure Availability Zones.
- **Self-Serve Tools:** Guidance on using Azure native tools to assess and validate resiliency for:
   - Virtual Machines (VMs)
   - Databases (DBs)
   - Containers (Azure Kubernetes Service, Linux VMs)
- **Backup and Recovery:** Best practices for implementing Azure Backup for all major workloads to ensure rapid recovery and minimal data loss.
- **Immutability & Ransomware Protection:**
   - Enhance data and cyber resiliency with immutable backups
   - Built-in threat detection to defend against ransomware attacks
- **Expanded Workload Coverage:** Addressing resilience strategies for a broad array of applications and services within Azure.
- **Actionable Insights:** Utilizing real-time monitoring and analytics to proactively safeguard applications and infrastructure against threats and failures.

## Practical Takeaways

- Assess resilience health and failover readiness with Azure's assessment tools
- Implement layered backup strategies and immutability features to resist tampering and ransomware
- Monitor resilience posture and incidents using Azure's built-in dashboards
- Apply protection and recovery policies tailored to VMs, AKS clusters, and databases
- Explore new Azure features improving workload coverage and security
