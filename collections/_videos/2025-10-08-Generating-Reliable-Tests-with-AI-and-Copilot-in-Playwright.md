# Generating Reliable Tests with AI and Copilot in Playwright

**Presented by:** Debbie O’Brien, Microsoft Developer

## Overview

This session explores how AI, particularly GitHub Copilot bolstered by Microsoft Copilot Professional (MCP), can be used to automatically generate test scripts for Playwright. Developers will learn how AI can interact with web applications—performing actions like browsing, clicking, and typing—and convert those interactions into functional Playwright tests.

## Key Highlights

- **AI-assisted Test Generation:** Demonstrates how Copilot and MCP can record user interactions and convert them into Playwright testing code.
- **Practical Workflow:** Shows the practical workflow for automated test case creation, reducing manual scripting overhead.
- **Reliability Considerations:** Covers how to ensure AI-generated tests are reliable and actionable in real-world applications.
