# Orchestrating Multiple AI Agents in VS Code: Insights from Ben & Peng

**Host:** James (VS Code Team)
**Guests:** Ben & Peng (VS Code Product Team)

## Overview

This episode dives deep into recent advancements in AI-powered development within Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Specifically, the team discusses:

- The evolution from Copilot Free to complex AI agent orchestration inside VS Code
- How the new agent sessions UI enables parallel workflows
- The architectural and practical differences between local, background, and cloud agents
- Ways developers can leverage agents for greater productivity

## Key Discussion Points

### Agent Flavors

- **Interactive Local Agents:** For contextual, chat-based problem solving
- **Background Agents:** For long-running, delegated tasks
- **Cloud Agents:** For scalable and resource-intensive operations hosted in the cloud

### Why Orchestration Matters

- Developers can now run multiple agent sessions in parallel for different tasks
- The UI treats each agent session like an inbox item to triage, increasing developer productivity
- Output artifacts can include code, tests, screenshots, video, and more, improving review and feedback loops

### Practical Tips

- Build context and clarify intent through local chat agents before delegating
- Harden projects by integrating linting and automated tests, improving agent reliability
- Expect more than just code completions: agent results can be documentation, test cases, or other media

### Workflow Insights

- Use parallel session management to break down complex tasks
- Triage agent outputs just like reviewing email or pull requests
- Adopt best practices for using cloud resources efficiently when working with cloud agents

### Future Directions in VS Code

- Expect the VS Code environment to further enhance agent and Copilot integration
- Improved user experience for session management, feedback, and workflow customization
