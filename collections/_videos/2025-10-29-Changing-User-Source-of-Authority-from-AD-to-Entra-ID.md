# Changing User Source of Authority from AD to Entra ID

John Savill's Technical Training takes you through the process of moving your users’ source of authority (SOA) from classic Active Directory (AD) to Microsoft Entra ID to benefit from Entra ID’s advanced governance and security.

## Overview

- **AD and Entra ID Relationship**: The session begins by clarifying how Active Directory and Entra ID work together and what it means for user management in hybrid and cloud-first environments.
- **Why Change SOA?**: Shifting user authority to Entra ID allows organizations to take advantage of improved cloud-based governance, security capabilities, and gives a foundation for modern identity management.

## Key Steps Covered

1. **Pre-requisites**
   - Review current state of AD and Entra ID synchronization
   - Ensure readiness for change (as covered in video at 06:02)
2. **Group SOA Migration**
   - Importance of moving group source of authority first (09:18)
3. **Making the Change**
   - Details the step-by-step process for shifting user SOA (09:24)
   - Outlines what to expect and what might change for end-users (13:33)
4. **Next Steps & Planning**
   - Emphasizes the need to use Microsoft documentation for a robust transition (15:07)
   - References official docs: [aka.ms/SOAITArchitectsGuidance](https://aka.ms/SOAITArchitectsGuidance) and [aka.ms/usersoadocs](https://aka.ms/usersoadocs)
