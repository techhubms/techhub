# Building Custom Agents for Copilot: Rubber Duck Thursdays

**Presented by:** GitHub

## Overview

Rubber Duck Thursdays is a lighthearted, informal stream where the GitHub team live codes and explores new features, projects, or developer tools. In this episode, the focus is on creating custom agents to extend GitHub Copilot, enabling it to offer deeper, tailored expertise for specific development tasks.

## What Are Custom Agents for Copilot?

Custom agents in GitHub Copilot allow you to guide Copilot’s behavior and suggestions for distinct domains or project requirements. By specifying goals and expertise, developers can:

- Get more relevant code completions
- Automate repetitive or domain-specific coding workflows
- Incorporate best practices into suggested code

## What You'll Learn

- How to build and configure custom agents in GitHub Copilot
- Real examples of enhancing development productivity using agents
- Tips for aligning agents with specific technologies or project needs

## Key Topics Covered

- Introduction to Copilot’s agent framework
- Defining tasks and expertise for custom agents
- Live coding session: walking through the setup of a custom agent
- Practical use cases: streamlining tasks with agent-driven Copilot suggestions
- Q&A with the GitHub team

## Why Custom Agents?

Custom agents empower developers to go beyond generic AI coding assistance by providing tailored solutions. They can:

- Support niche programming domains
- Enforce coding standards
- Handle project-specific automations

## Getting Involved

- Link to stream recording or resources (if available)
- How to share your own custom agents and feedback with the GitHub team
