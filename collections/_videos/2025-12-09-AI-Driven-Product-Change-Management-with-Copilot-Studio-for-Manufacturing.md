# AI-Driven Product Change Management with Copilot Studio for Manufacturing

The Product Change Management agent template is an AI-powered solution tailored for manufacturers seeking to modernize and streamline the management of changes across equipment, products, and processes. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, this agent automates workflows, connects disparate systems, and assists teams in handling product changes more efficiently.

- **Error Reduction**: Standardizes and systematizes workflows, decreasing the likelihood of mistakes during change approvals.
- **Innovation Acceleration**: Allows organizations to implement changes and bring new products to market more quickly.

## Features

- **Workflow Automation**: The agent triggers and manages workflows that span teams and departments, replacing manual interventions.
- **System Integration**: Connects to existing manufacturing and business systems to assure consistent process execution.
- **AI Guidance**: Utilizes AI for process recommendations and real-time decision support in change management scenarios.

## Built With

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio**: The central platform for authoring, managing, and running AI-powered workflow agents.
- **Microsoft Cloud**: The template integrates with Microsoft’s cloud ecosystem for scalability and security.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Change Request**: Team members can submit equipment, product, or process change requests through standardized forms or interfaces.
2. **Automated Workflow Launch**: The agent identifies necessary approvers and automates notification and escalation workflows.
3. **Integrated System Checks**: Ensures all dependent systems are updated and impacted teams are informed automatically.
4. **Completion and Audit**: Automatically documents approvals, changes, and outcomes for compliance and monitoring purposes.
