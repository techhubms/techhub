- **Error Reduction**: Standardizes and systematizes workflows, decreasing the likelihood of mistakes during change approvals.
- **Innovation Acceleration**: Allows organizations to implement changes and bring new products to market more quickly.

## Features

- **Workflow Automation**: The agent triggers and manages workflows that span teams and departments, replacing manual interventions.
- **System Integration**: Connects to existing manufacturing and business systems to assure consistent process execution.
- **AI Guidance**: Utilizes AI for process recommendations and real-time decision support in change management scenarios.

## Built With

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio**: The central platform for authoring, managing, and running AI-powered workflow agents.
- **Microsoft Cloud**: The template integrates with Microsoft’s cloud ecosystem for scalability and security.

## How It Works

1. **Initiate Change Request**: Team members can submit equipment, product, or process change requests through standardized forms or interfaces.
2. **Automated Workflow Launch**: The agent identifies necessary approvers and automates notification and escalation workflows.
3. **Integrated System Checks**: Ensures all dependent systems are updated and impacted teams are informed automatically.
4. **Completion and Audit**: Automatically documents approvals, changes, and outcomes for compliance and monitoring purposes.
