# AI Operations: Real-Time Monitoring and Governance with Microsoft Foundry Control Plane

**Speakers:** Ken Archer, Sarah Bird, Florent Ricci  
**Session:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 (BRK205)

## Overview

This session dives into observability, governance, and security for organizations deploying AI agents at scale, using Microsoft Foundry's Control Plane. Experts from Microsoft break down tools and strategies for maximizing reliability, compliance, and operational efficiency when running advanced AI workloads in production.

## Key Topics

### Two-Dimensional Security Approach for AI Agents

- Explains Microsoft's principles of securing both the external and internal access vectors for AI agents.

### Foundry Control Plane Capabilities

- Walkthrough of real-time visibility and control mechanisms for managing AI agents.
- Provides actionable dashboards and observability features for tracking agent performance and lifecycle.
