# Translating Conversations Using Azure AI Foundry Translator API

This episode from Microsoft Developer introduces the Azure AI Foundry Translator API (Public Preview), a service designed to translate text with state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) and large language model (LLM) translation.

## Episode Overview

- **Service**: Azure AI Foundry Translator API (Public Preview)
- **Key Features**:
  - NMT for reliable, scalable machine translation
  - LLM-based translation for context-aware results
  - Support for translating user conversations
  - Accommodation for tone (formal/informal) and gender in outputs

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up Azure and Azure AI Foundry resources for translation tasks
- Difference between NMT and LLM translation
- When to use NMT vs. LLM for different translation needs
- How to implement translation features that account for tone and gender
- Combining multiple translation targets in complex scenarios

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Setup Resources**
   - Instructions begin at 1:11 in the episode
   - Configure Azure resources required for AI Foundry
   - Links to resource configuration: [Configure Azure Resources](https://aka.ms/insideAIF/configure-Azure-resources)

2. **Implement Translation**
   - Neural Machine Translation vs. Large Language Model options (5:36–10:17)
   - When to use each method for optimal results (10:18–11:24)

3. **Advanced Capabilities**
   - LLM translation for handling tone (11:25–14:43) and gender (14:44–18:07)
   - Demonstrates how nuanced translation enhances user experience
   - Combining multiple translation targets (18:08–21:23)
