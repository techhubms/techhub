# Lumen Defender and Microsoft Security: Enhancing SOC Threat Detection and Response

**Speakers:** Ankur Arora, Craig D’Abreo, Susmita Nayak
**Session:** Microsoft Ignite 2025 | BRK383

## Overview

Organizations shifting to Microsoft Security face increasing complexity in threat detection, compliance, and response. This session details how Lumen Defender integrates with Microsoft’s security stack to deliver outside-in intelligence for Security Operations Center (SOC) teams.

### Key Topics

- **SOC Team Challenges:** Addressing data overload and complexity in alert management.
- **AI-First End-to-End Security Platform:** Introduction to Microsoft’s platform and its four security planes.
- **Lumen Partnership:** Overview of Lumen’s connectors in the Security Store that deliver real-time threat feeds.
- **Black Lotus Labs:** Explaining their role in Lumen’s threat intelligence and how global backbone visibility detects reused attack infrastructure.
- **Network Visibility Analogy:** Using U.S. highways as an analogy to help practitioners understand network-based detection.
- **Early Warnings:** Leveraging network intelligence for faster identification of suspicious activities.
- **Endpoint vs. Network Intelligence:** Comparison models, benefits for SOCs, and integration strategies.
- **Enterprise Security Approach:** Tactics such as passing suspicious traffic into logs for later analysis.

## Actionable Strategies

- Implement connectors available in the Security Store to ingest Lumen Defender data into Microsoft Security tools.
- Use Black Lotus Labs intelligence to supplement existing Microsoft threat detection.
- Prioritize network-level visibility alongside endpoint monitoring for earlier threat warnings.
- Follow enterprise tactics as showcased, allowing for deeper log-based analysis.
