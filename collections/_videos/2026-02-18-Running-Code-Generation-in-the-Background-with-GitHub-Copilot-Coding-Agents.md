# Running Code Generation in the Background with GitHub Copilot Coding Agents

**Presented by Tim Rogers, GitHub**

GitHub Copilot Coding Agents have evolved to run in the cloud, allowing developers to offload complex code generation and automation tasks while continuing to work uninterrupted locally. This walkthrough covers:

## Key Features

### Delegating Complex Tasks

- Offload operations like "add comprehensive tests" to Copilot agents running in the cloud
- Continue coding as agents work in the background

### Multiple Entry Points

- **Trigger Copilot Coding Agents** from:
  - GitHub.com
  - Visual Studio Code
  - GitHub CLI

### Model Selection and Customization

- Choose which AI model powers your coding agents (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus)
- Model choice affects result quality and performance

### Automation Use Cases

- Automated code review
- Security scanning
- Performance optimization tasks

### Copilot CLI Integrations

- Handoff tasks from the cloud agent to your local workflow via CLI
- Delegate work initiated locally to be executed in the cloud

## Roadmap and Considerations

- Upcoming features: more planning capabilities, enhanced privacy options, extended reporting tools
- Privacy and performance optimization are a focus of ongoing development
