# AI Toolkit + GitHub Copilot - Part 1: Environment Setup

This video, hosted by April from Microsoft Developer, kicks off the 'AI Toolkit + GitHub Copilot' series aimed at preparing developers for building agent-based solutions with Microsoft Foundry models.

## Workshop Context

Part of the GitHub Copilot + AI Toolkit Pet Planner workshop, this session focuses on essential environment setup steps:

- **Creating a Microsoft Foundry Project:** Learn how to set up your Microsoft Foundry workspace at [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com).
- **Installing the AI Toolkit:** Get the AI Toolkit from [aka.ms/AIToolkit](https://aka.ms/AIToolkit) and follow the workshop instructions at [aka.ms/AIToolkit/workshop](https://aka.ms/AIToolkit/workshop).
- **Visual Studio Code Setup:** Examine recommended extensions and minimal VS Code configuration required for development.
- **GitHub Copilot Integration:** Understand how to configure GitHub Copilot to actively assist in coding and agent creation tasks in your Foundry projects.
- **Signing In to Azure:** Walk through connecting your development environment to Azure services, ensuring your Foundry resources are properly accessible.

## Learning Outcomes

- Prepare a local development environment for AI Toolkit and GitHub Copilot.
- Create and configure your Microsoft Foundry project.
- Leverage GitHub Copilot to support AI-powered coding workflows.
- Install and configure required extensions for seamless development within VS Code.
