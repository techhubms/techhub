# GitHub Copilot SDK Demo: Creating "Flight School"

**Presenter:** Chris Reddington

## Overview

In this session, Chris Reddington demonstrates "Flight School," a custom application built with Next.js and the GitHub Copilot SDK. The app delivers a unique, personalized learning experience for developers by generating daily coding challenges that align with users' GitHub profiles.

Key features include:

- **Agentic Workflows:** Leverages the Copilot SDK for advanced, automated workflows that personalize content.
- **Challenge Generation:** Uses data from GitHub profiles to tailor coding challenges for the user.
- **Test Evaluation:** Automatically evaluates user-submitted solutions against pre-defined test cases.
- **Project Export:** Automates exporting completed projects to new GitHub repositories for easy sharing and version control.

## Technical Details

- **Tech Stack:** Next.js for front-end, GitHub Copilot SDK for backend automation.
- **Workflow Automation:** Demonstrates functional agentic workflows enabled by Copilot SDK, such as content customization and outcome analysis.
- **Integration:** Deep API integration with GitHub for user profiling, repository management, and CI/CD hooks.

## Benefits and Applications

- Streamlines creating tailored, interactive learning paths for developers.
- Empowers users to practice coding in personalized scenarios and see results in real time.
