# Secure and Smart AI Agents with Azure Redis in .NET

Traditional data access methods are evolving with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agentic applications. This session demonstrates:

- Latest design patterns for integrating Azure Redis into .NET agentic apps
- How to leverage Azure Redis with MCP (Microsoft Cloud Protocol) servers for simplified agentic application development
- Enhancements for agent capabilities using Redis-backed tools
- The newest security features for Redis in Azure, ensuring data protection and compliance

Key Topics:

## Using Azure Redis with MCP Servers

- Overview of MCP protocol benefits for scalable, agentic .NET applications
- Patterns to streamline agent-to-data communication

## Simplifying Agentic Application Development
