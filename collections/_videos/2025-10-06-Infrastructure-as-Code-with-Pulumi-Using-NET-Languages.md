# Infrastructure as Code with Pulumi Using .NET Languages

**Presented by:** Cam Soper on On .NET Live

## Overview

This session introduces Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Pulumi, an open source platform which allows developers to define, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure using languages they're already familiar with, such as C# and F#.

## Key Topics Discussed

- **Pulumi Introduction:** Learn what Pulumi is and how it differs from other IaC tools. Pulumi allows you to use general purpose programming languages, providing benefits like rich type systems, loop constructs, and code reuse.
- **.NET Integration:** Demonstrates using Pulumi with C# and F#, making Infrastructure as Code approachable for .NET developers.
- **Cross-cloud Capability:** Pulumi can deploy infrastructure to any cloud, including Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and more.
- **Developer Experience:** Shows how existing developer workflows, source control practices, and toolchains (such as Visual Studio and .NET CLI) can be reused for infrastructure work.

## Demo Highlights

- Creating and deploying cloud resources using C# scripts in Pulumi
- Managing configuration and state within Pulumi projects
- Advantages of type safety and code sharing when using familiar languages
- Real-world scenarios using infrastructure automation in a .NET environment

## Benefits

- Faster onboarding for .NET developers into cloud infrastructure work
- Ability to apply software engineering best practices to infrastructure code
- Streamlined workflow: use your existing tools to manage both code and cloud resources
