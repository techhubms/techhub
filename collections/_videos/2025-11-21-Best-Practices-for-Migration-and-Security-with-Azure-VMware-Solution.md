# Best Practices for Migration and Security with Azure VMware Solution

**Presented at Microsoft Ignite 2025 by Sundeep Hiranandaney and Justin Jakowski**

## Introduction

Enterprises face increasing demands to modernize their IT infrastructure without jeopardizing existing mission-critical operations. Azure VMware Solution (AVS) offers a low-risk, scalable path to migrate VMware-based workloads to the cloud by extending on-premises environments into Azure, retaining existing skillsets and investments.

## Cloud Migration Strategies and Azure Options

- Overview of cloud migration approaches, distinguishing between rapid lift-and-shift strategies and deeper modernization efforts.
- AVS enables organizations to capitalize on Azure’s scale and innovation while minimizing disruption.

## Real-World Case Studies

- **State of Alaska**: Successfully migrated entire data centers to AVS, illustrating cost-effectiveness and operational continuity.
- Other customer examples demonstrated various modernization trajectories tailored to unique business requirements.

## Engineering Investments

- Microsoft’s significant enhancements in AVS hardware and networking deliver increased performance, reliability, and seamless integration with native Azure services.

## Enterprise-Grade Security

- In-depth exploration of security features integrated with AVS, including:
  - Microsoft security tool integrations for monitoring, threat detection, and access management
  - Extended security updates for legacy Windows Server and SQL Server versions
- Guidance on securing migrated and hybrid environments in Azure

## Live Demonstration

- Demonstration of VMware HCX migration, highlighting network and operational considerations, as well as tips for a smooth transition to Azure infrastructure.

## Migration Targets and Pathways

- Review of typical migration targets and modernization paths supported by AVS
- Discussion on how to select the optimal route based on current and future enterprise needs

## Next Steps

- Recommended actions for organizations starting their migration journey
- Common challenges and how to address them
- Resources for further learning and support
