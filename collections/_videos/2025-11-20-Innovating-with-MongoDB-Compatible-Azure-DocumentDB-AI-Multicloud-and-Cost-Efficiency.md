# Innovating with MongoDB-Compatible Azure DocumentDB: AI, Multicloud, and Cost Efficiency

**Speakers:** Patty Chow, Khelan Modi, Gurvinder Singh  
**Session:** BRK132 | Microsoft Ignite 2025  
**Format:** Advanced Breakout (300)  

## Introduction

Azure DocumentDB, now open-source under the Linux Foundation and featuring MongoDB compatibility, provides a fully managed document database platform for modern application development. This session details how organizations like Kraft Heinz accelerate innovation and reduce operational overhead using DocumentDB's JSON-native model, turnkey scaling, and enterprise-grade security supported by Azure's end-to-end SLA.

## Key Technical Topics

- **Open Source MongoDB Compatible Engine:** DocumentDB now supports MongoDB workloads in a fully managed Azure service, increasing cloud portability and flexibility.
- **Turnkey Scaling and Updates:** Automatic scaling and system updates reduce operations, enabling rapid application iteration.
- **Enterprise Security:** Built-in data protection and compliance features meet stringent enterprise requirements.
- **Hybrid and Multicloud Support:** DocumentDB is deployable across on-premises, Azure, and other clouds for true hybrid flexibility.

## Demo Highlights

### LLM-Based Index Advisor & AI Ready Features

- Live demonstration of the new AI-driven Index Advisor powered by large language models (LLMs) for automating index optimization.
- Query optimization using AI techniques, reducing manual overhead and boosting performance.

### Migration and Data Verification

- Step-by-step migration using tools and VS Code extensions to transfer collections (e.g., Sample Restaurants database).
- Verification of data integrity post-migration within developer tooling.

### Advanced Query Capabilities

- Support for K-nearest neighbors (KNN) queries and semantic discovery for advanced search scenarios.
- Demonstrations of deterministic versus semantic search behaviors and hybrid search techniques.

### Cosmos AI Graph Architecture

- Overview of Cosmos AI Graph components enabling complex data relationships and real-time analytics within document databases.

### Multicloud and Hybrid Workloads

- Technical explanation of deployment options for hybrid and multicloud environments, highlighting scalability and reliability features.

## Getting Started

- Early access options for DocumentDB and integration resources are shared for developers and architects to evaluate in their data platform projects.
- Additional resources: [Azure SQL & AI Development Plans](https://aka.ms/ignite25-plans-AzureSQLAIDevelopment), [Microsoft Ignite Sessions](https://ignite.microsoft.com)

## Conclusion

This session empowers technical teams to modernize their data platform strategies using DocumentDB's open-source engine, AI-enhanced features, and cross-cloud capabilities. With support for advanced analytics and seamless migration workflows, organizations can reduce costs while maintaining flexibility and performance at scale.
