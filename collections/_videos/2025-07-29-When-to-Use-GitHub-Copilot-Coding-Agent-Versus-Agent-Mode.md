## When to Use GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Versus Agent Mode

**Author:** GitHub

### Overview

This video breaks down the two major agentic capabilities available in GitHub Copilot:

- **Copilot Coding Agent**: Best suited for autonomous, background tasks such as issue assignment and repetitive work like testing migration.
- **Copilot Agent Mode**: Geared towards interactive, iterative development, allowing developers to work alongside Copilot in a collaborative manner, such as building and refining a game in real time.

### Key Demonstrations

The content is structured around practical, real-world examples:

#### 00:00 - Assign Issue to Copilot Coding Agent

- Demonstrates how to allocate a tedious testing migration task to the Copilot coding agent, which works autonomously in the background without user intervention.
- This frees up the developer’s time and enables focus on more engaging or creative activities.

#### 00:19 - Use Copilot Agent Mode to Create a New Game

- Shifts focus to Copilot Agent Mode, showcasing how it facilitates interactive application development.
- The user can actively guide and iterate on project features in a collaborative dialog with the agent.
- Especially useful for tasks requiring frequent decision-making, iteration, and developer input.

#### 01:53 - Review Copilot Coding Agent's Work

- Reviews the output produced by the Copilot coding agent on the earlier assigned testing migration.
- Demonstrates division of labor and improved workflow efficiency by combining both Copilot capabilities.

### Practical Takeaways

- **Copilot Coding Agent** excels at offloading repeating, resource-intensive tasks.
- **Copilot Agent Mode** shines in creative, iterative, and interactive software development scenarios.
- Developers can strategically choose which mode matches their workflow: delegating monotonous work to Copilot’s autonomous features and reserving their own time for high-value tasks.
