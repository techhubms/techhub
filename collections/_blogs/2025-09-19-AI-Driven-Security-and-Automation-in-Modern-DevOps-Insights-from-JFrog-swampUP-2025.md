# AI-Driven Security and Automation in Modern DevOps: Insights from JFrog swampUP 2025

*Author: Alan Shimel*

At the JFrog swampUP 2025 conference in Napa Valley, JFrog co-founder and CTO Yoav Landman sat down to discuss the rapidly evolving software delivery landscape amid the rise of AI-driven development. This conversation centered on the company’s major announcements and broader implications for DevOps teams striving for both innovation and security.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Unified Governance via AppTrust**: JFrog introduced AppTrust for comprehensive traceability and compliance, ensuring that every artifact—human- and AI-generated—can be validated and trusted across the entire delivery pipeline.

- **Managing AI-Driven Development with Fly**: The new “agentic repository” solution, JFrog Fly, empowers AI agents to interact securely with APIs and workflows using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This addresses the growing complexity of automated, agent-driven DevOps, helping teams retain full control and observability.

- **Production-Ready Features Shaped by Feedback**: Landman emphasized that new features stem directly from user feedback at swampUP, with customer input accelerating iteration cycles as AI adoption increases.

- **Software Supply Chain Security and Velocity**: The conversation reiterated the urgent need for platforms to become “systems of record” for DevOps, enabling increased release velocity without sacrificing governance or security. The realities of modern development require trust and automation to be foundational principles.

## Selected Quotes

> "The aim is to ensure that every artifact—whether human- or AI-generated—can be validated and trusted before moving through the pipeline."

> "In a world where AI is changing how code is created and deployed, trust and automation aren’t optional—they’re foundational."
