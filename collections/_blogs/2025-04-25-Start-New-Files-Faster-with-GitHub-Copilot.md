# Start New Files Faster with GitHub Copilot

*Posted by Randy Pagels on May 16, 2025*

Starting a new code file doesn’t have to be tedious. With GitHub Copilot, you can generate foundational code templates instantly for a wide array of file types, allowing you to focus more on feature work and less on setup.

## Let Copilot Generate the Starting Template

Instead of searching for boilerplate code or manually configuring new files, leverage Copilot to create core structures. Here’s how:

1. **Create a new file** in your project (examples: `index.html`, `app.py`, or `component.jsx`).
2. **Add a clear comment** at the top, describing what you want (such as `# Create a Flask API with one GET route` or `// Create a basic React component that displays a user profile`).
3. **Activate Copilot** by pressing Tab or opening Copilot Chat (`Ctrl + I`) to accept, refine, or expand the suggestion.
4. **Review and adjust** the generated code as needed.

### Supported File Types

GitHub Copilot excels at generating:

- Python scripts
- HTML boilerplates
- React components
- CSS files
- YAML configuration files
- Dockerfiles
- GitHub Actions workflows

## Key Benefits

- **Faster prototyping:** Get from zero to functioning code structure in seconds.
- **Reduce repetition:** Skip routine scaffolding and let Copilot fill in the blanks.
- **Consistency:** Ensure standard file structures across projects.

## Quick Takeaway

Whenever you open a blank file, let GitHub Copilot jumpstart your work. A strong foundation means you spend more energy building business logic, not chasing boilerplate. For those who want to write better code, faster—Copilot is a game changer.
