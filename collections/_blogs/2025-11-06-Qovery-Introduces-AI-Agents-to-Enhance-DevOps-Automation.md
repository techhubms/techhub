# Qovery Introduces AI Agents to Enhance DevOps Automation

Qovery has released multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents as a major update to its DevOps automation platform. These AI agents, known as the AI DevOps Copilot family, are designed to:

- Respond to natural language prompts
- Execute complex DevOps operations
- Anticipate next steps within workflows

## Features and Capabilities

### Automated Core DevOps Tasks

- **Provisioning and Managing Environments**: Automates creation and clean-up of environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Optimization**: Identifies and improves pipeline efficiency, reducing redundancy and brittleness.
- **Process Observation**: Monitors ongoing operations for potential issues or inefficiencies.
- **DevSecOps Governance**: Helps enforce security policies across workflows.
- **FinOps Integration**: Recommends financial best practices to optimize infrastructure costs.

### Intelligent Operations

- AI agents are trained on data from over 25 million applications and 30 million infrastructure actions.
- The platform uses the Claude large language models (LLMs) by Anthropic, with planned support for additional models.

### Role-Based Approvals and Data Protection

- Critical actions, such as deleting databases, require explicit role-based permission.
- Private credentials are not shared with AI models, maintaining security standards.

### Automation Examples

- Automatically shutting down unused environments.
- Scheduling deployments or integration tests based on system stability.

## Platform Flexibility

- Supports a wide array of tools, giving organizations the freedom to use preferred technologies without vendor lock-in.

## Industry Context & Adoption

- Many teams still spend time on low-level maintenance—Qovery aims to reduce manual effort via intelligent automation and platform engineering.
- As AI coding tools become more common, DevOps teams face pressure to modernize workflows and manage increasing code volume.

## Limitations

- Full automation of all tasks isn’t yet possible, and adoption rates vary across organizations. Challenges such as pipeline maintenance and reuse remain areas for further improvement.
