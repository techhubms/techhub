# Harness CEO Advocates AI-Driven Transformation of CI/CD Workflows

**Author:** Mike Vizard

## Key Highlights

- Jyoti Bansal, CEO of Harness, calls for a fundamental reimagining of CI/CD workflows to capitalize on AI advancements, as described in his keynote at Unscripted 2025.
- Traditional CI/CD and DevSecOps processes are overwhelmed by the surge in code volume produced by AI coding tools, with current pipelines struggling to handle increases up to tenfold in some organizations.
- Bansal claims that 70% of build and deployment time is lost to manual or homegrown tasks, rather than development.

## Harness’ AI-Centric Platform Features

- **AI-driven Issue Remediation:** Modern CI/CD platforms can now use AI to automatically address build issues and remediate vulnerabilities, eliminating repetitive tasks and reducing friction.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Automation:** AI not only detects tasks needed for successful builds but can execute them autonomously, while keeping developers updated and involved for key approvals.
- **Integrating DevSecOps:** The Harness AI platform, leveraging tools such as Traceable, can write code to fix detected security vulnerabilities, which developers can then review and insert into upcoming builds.
- **Leverage of Large Language Models (LLMs):** By employing LLM reasoning, Harness claims to accelerate root cause analysis and automate the generation and testing of code changes.
- **Internal Developer Portal (IDP):** Harness also enhances developer self-service through an AI-powered IDP based on the open source Backstage platform.
- **Cost Optimization:** AI agents can enforce FinOps policies to optimize operational costs within the CI/CD ecosystem.

## Industry Context & Adoption

- According to Bansal, more than 100 Harness customers have already adopted these AI-driven workflows to automate and scale development operations.
- The article notes industry debate about whether organizations will require entirely new platforms to enable deep AI automation or if AI agents can be incrementally layered onto current tools.

## Conclusion

Bansal concludes that engineering teams will inevitably rely more on AI-driven automation to manage software delivery at scale. The increasing integration of AI is shifting developer focus from repetitive tasks to higher-level responsibilities within modern DevOps and security workflows.
