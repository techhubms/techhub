Alan Shimel explores major developments from JFrog’s SwampUP 2025, examining how AI, DevOps automation, and enterprise governance are converging to transform software supply chains.<!--excerpt_end-->

# JFrog SwampUP 2025: AI, DevOps, and the Future of Secure Software Supply Chains

**By Alan Shimel**

Each year, the JFrog SwampUP conference surfaces what's next for DevOps, software delivery, and—now more than ever—AI-driven workflows. The 2025 event in Napa underscored JFrog's stated mission: to define how modern software is built, secured, and shipped in an era marked by escalating supply chain risks and rapid AI adoption.

## Why SwampUP Matters

Recent years have seen software supply chain security rank high on every technology leader’s agenda. With the proliferation of AI models and automation, enterprises face new challenges balancing speed, compliance, and trust. JFrog's vision seeks to alleviate these tensions by positioning itself as the system of record for both software artifacts and AI models—building in governance and rigorous compliance from the ground up.

Key highlights:

- **Partnerships**: Deep integrations with hyperscalers, NVIDIA, and ServiceNow to support ambitious governance and automation goals.
- **System of Record**: Centralization of artifact and AI model management to drive trust and visibility.

## JFrog Fly: Zero-Config, AI-Native Release Management

JFrog introduced **JFrog Fly**, promoted as the first agentic repository for DevOps teams hungry for automation. The tool promises:

- Semantic release management
- Zero-configuration setup
- Centralized artifact sharing
- Seamless AI repository integration

By targeting release management (historically fragmented and manual), Fly aspires to play for DevOps what GitHub Copilot did for coding: reduce friction, speed up delivery, and enable smaller teams to scale reliably.

## AppTrust: The DevGovOps Evolution

**JFrog AppTrust** moves governance to the core of software delivery. AppTrust provides:

- Automated quality gates and compliance checks
- Secure release management with cryptographic signing
- Deep integration with platforms like ServiceNow

What sets AppTrust apart is its focus on app-level context, tracking ownership, dependencies, and risk in each release—transforming compliance from a project bottleneck into a force multiplier for delivery teams.

## AI Catalog: Bringing Rigor to AI/ML Model Management

Recognizing the AI governance gap, JFrog launched the **AI Catalog**, a secure hub for discovering, managing, and deploying AI/ML models. Core features include:

- One-click deployments for NVIDIA and Anthropic models
- Continuous model scanning with JFrog Xray
- Governance controls for both internal and third-party models

The AI Catalog aims to bring traceability and controls historically available for code artifacts into the rapidly evolving world of AI and ML—a critical need for responsible enterprise adoption.

## The Evidence Ecosystem: Compliance Backed by Proof

AppTrust’s new **Evidence Ecosystem** establishes a tamper-evident audit trail for compliance, utilizing partnerships with GitHub, ServiceNow, Sonar, and others. This creates:

- Centralized, cryptographically signed attestations
- A unified, transparent source for audits and regulatory checks

## Industry Impact and Looking Forward

SwampUP 2025’s core message: AI-native DevOps, secure supply chains, and integrated governance are converging into a new industry standard. "Move fast and prove trust" replaces "move fast and break things." Organizations entrenched in software delivery, security, and AI development will find these announcements prescient and foundational.

Stay tuned for more analysis and updates from the SwampUP event as new features and integrations are announced.
