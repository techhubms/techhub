# Building AI Apps That Earn User Trust: Human-Centered Testing and Continuous Feedback

**Author:** Chris Sheehan

## Introduction

Developers are increasingly encountering challenges beyond traditional accuracy metrics when deploying AI-powered features. While technical performance is essential, user-reported incidents of bias, confusing outputs, and even public criticisms of generated content are rising. According to an Applause survey, 65% of users experienced issues such as bias, hallucinations, or incorrect responses with AI applications in early 2025. This makes trust the new competitive edge for AI-based user experience, with traditional testing alone insufficient.

## Why Traditional Testing Falls Short

AI systems are probabilistic and adaptive, rather than deterministic like most traditional software. Unit testing, edge-case validation, and output checks often fail to capture real-world AI user experience—especially regarding fairness, transparency, and trustworthiness. Automated testing can miss subtle or persistent biases that affect diverse demographic groups, risking wider trust issues and potential business impact.

## Human-Centered Testing: Practical Steps

**1. Involve Human Evaluators From Day One**

- Integrate real users from diverse backgrounds, ages, and accessibility needs into testing processes, not just internal team members.
- Evaluate AI outputs for fairness, clarity, and effectiveness across user segments.

**2. Test Explanation Capabilities**

- Build explainability features directly into AI architecture.
- Validate that explanations for AI outputs are understandable by users, not just technically correct.

## Building Inclusive Feedback Loops

- Move beyond surveys and star ratings: collect qualitative feedback via interviews, focus groups, and long-term user studies.
- Set up feedback channels to fit different user preferences, such as quick polls, in-depth conversations, and community forums.
- Test AI systems in real-world situations to account for context and environment (e.g., how voice AI performs in noisy vs. quiet locations).

## Monitoring Trust Over Time

- Develop trust-centric KPIs—like user confidence scores, bias detection rates, and explanation clarity.
- Track these alongside technical performance, using real user insights to guide future model training and fine-tuning.
- Communicate clearly about current AI limitations and improvement efforts to manage user expectations and build goodwill.

## Concrete Actions for Developers

- **Audit testing practices:** Assess tester diversity and the depth of fairness/bias checking.
- **Establish regular human evaluation cycles:** Incorporate demographic diversity into every test phase.
- **Enable broad feedback:** Offer multiple channels for users to report issues or suggest improvements.
- **Define and monitor trust metrics:** Document and track project-specific KPIs for user trust.

## Conclusion

Trust in AI is not just about technical correctness, but about proactively designing for fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. By applying human-centered testing and continuous, inclusive feedback, developers lay a stronger foundation for AI applications that attract and retain users in the long term.
