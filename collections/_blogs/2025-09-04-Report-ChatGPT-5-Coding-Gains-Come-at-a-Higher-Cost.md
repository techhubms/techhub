# Report: ChatGPT-5 Coding Gains Come at a Higher Cost

**Author:** Mike Vizard

A recent [Sonar report](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/how-reasoning-impacts-llm-coding-models/) investigates the improvements and trade-offs introduced by OpenAI's ChatGPT-5 coding models. The report evaluates more than 4,400 Java tasks and compares four reasoning levels available in GPT-5, highlighting changes in code quality, security, and productivity from earlier models like GPT-4o.

## Key Findings

- **Improved Code Quality at a Cost:**
  - Higher reasoning levels in ChatGPT-5 yield better code quality, particularly in reducing certain vulnerabilities and bugs.
  - However, higher reasoning settings drive up subscription cost (up to $189 per developer/month versus $22 for minimal capability).

- **Code Volume and Maintenance:**
  - Advanced reasoning models more than double the lines of code generated per task compared to previous versions.
  - Increased code volume introduces additional maintenance challenges, especially for developers unfamiliar with autogenerated code patterns.

- **Security Trade-Offs:**
  - While common vulnerabilities like path-traversal and injection flaws decrease, subtle issues (e.g., inadequate I/O error-handling) become more prevalent (44% in high reasoning, 30% in minimal reasoning).
  - Advanced modes shift bug profiles from basic control-flow mistakes to more complex issues like concurrency bugs (20% in minimal mode, up to 38% in high mode).

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
  - Teams should balance productivity benefits against higher subscription costs and the new challenges posed by increased code complexity.
  - Quality assurance remains essential, as even sophisticated AI tools produce both obvious and subtle security and logic flaws.

## Industry Context and Recommendations

- **DevOps Implications:**
  - The report encourages DevOps teams to actively verify AI-generated output, especially in production environments, and budget for increased operational costs tied to advanced features.
  - Adoption rates of advanced AI coding tools remain unclear, as does the percentage of autogenerated code making it to production.

- **Comparative Model Insights:**
  - Previous Sonar research found coding "personalities" and security flaw tendencies varied across LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta.
  - AI models demonstrate strong cross-language code translation and algorithmic problem-solving, but hard-coded credentials and severe vulnerabilities are still common.

Overall, while ChatGPT-5 marks a step forward in AI-assisted development, teams must stay vigilant about costs, maintenance, and code quality when integrating these tools into their workflows.
