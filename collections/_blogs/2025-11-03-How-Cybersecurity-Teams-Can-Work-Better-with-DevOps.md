Samuel Ogbonna details how cybersecurity and DevOps teams can enhance collaboration by embedding security throughout the DevOps pipeline, sharing actionable best practices and communication strategies.<!--excerpt_end-->

# How Cybersecurity Teams Can Work Better with DevOps

**Author:** Samuel Ogbonna

## Introduction

DevOps teams aim for rapid software delivery, but security often struggles to keep pace when treated as a separate function. This article explores how organizations can move from a checkpoint security mindset to integrating security (DevSecOps) at every stage of the development pipeline, ensuring cooperation without sacrificing speed.

## The Need for Security in DevOps

- **Definition:** Security in DevOps (DevSecOps) means embedding security checks and controls throughout the development and operations process, not just at the end.
- **Benefits:** Early vulnerability detection, reduced rework, heightened accountability for security across all roles, and improved compliance.

## Common Challenges in Cybersecurity/DevOps Collaboration

- **Communication Silos:** Different tools, language, and metrics used by security and DevOps teams can delay responses and reduce collaboration.
- **Conflicting Priorities:** Security teams focus on risk reduction and compliance, while DevOps teams prioritize speed and innovation.
- **Unclear Responsibilities:** When ownership of issues is vague, alerts may be ignored or mishandled.
- **Skills and Awareness Gaps:** Security teams may lack cloud-native skills, while DevOps may lack training in secure coding practices.

## Best Practices for Integrating Security in DevOps

### Define Shared Responsibilities

- Clearly assign which team handles specific threats and tasks (e.g., security team monitors threats, DevOps manages container setup).

### Cross-Train Teams and Appoint Security Champions

- Provide training for both teams on each other's tools and responsibilities.
- Designate a "security champion" in each DevOps team to bridge gaps and translate requirements into actionable tasks.

### Integrate Automated Security into CI/CD

- Use automated code scanners (SAST/DAST), dependency checkers, and IaC scanners to identify issues during development, not afterward.

### Unified Visibility and Tooling

- Implement shared dashboards or incident/bug trackers for both teams to review alerts and metrics together.

### Regular Communication Routine

- Schedule joint meetings, incident reviews, and "security office hours" for improved understanding and prevention of finger-pointing.

### Foster a DevSecOps Culture

- Make security a shared value at all levels, celebrate security wins, and invest in ongoing education and certifications.

### Continuous Improvement

- Regularly track security metrics (e.g., number of incidents, response time) and revisit processes after problems to improve future outcomes.

## Conclusion

By breaking down silos, clarifying responsibilities, leveraging automation, and fostering a DevSecOps culture, organizations can deliver secure software at speed. Regular review and adaptation of these practices help keep both DevOps and security teams aligned and effective.
