# The EU’s Cyber Resilience Act: Redefining Secure Software Development

**Author: Thabang Mashologu**

The European Union’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) sets a new standard for digital product cybersecurity, covering every phase from design to secure decommissioning. It applies to enterprise software, consumer applications, IoT devices, and embedded systems, enforcing security-by-design and transparency across the entire product lifecycle.

## Key CRA Milestones and Obligations

- **December 2024**: CRA enactment with a transition period for affected stakeholders.
- **September 2026**: Early obligations, including mandatory vulnerability reporting to ENISA.
- **December 11, 2027**: Full enforcement requiring SBOMs, secure update mechanisms, and compliance documentation.

Non-compliance risks include fines up to €15 million and EU market exclusion. CRA mandates:

- Machine-readable SBOMs for top-level dependencies
- Public vulnerability reporting channels and rapid remediation workflows
- Secure, ideally automated software updates, distinct from feature releases
- Upstream sharing of OSS patches
- Updated compliance documentation

## Roles and Responsibilities in Software Ecosystem

- **Manufacturers**: Legally responsible for product security and compliance
- **Open Source Stewards**: Economic actors systematically supporting OSS for commercial use
- **Maintainers/Contributors**: Generally exempt but affected by dependency chains and upstream security practices

CRA’s structure exempts casual contributors but pushes all organizations to adopt transparent, secure development approaches.

## DevOps and Security Teams: Practical Impact

DevOps practitioners must integrate CRA principles by:

- Automating SBOM generation and maintenance for all digital products
- Establishing or improving vulnerability disclosure and incident reporting
- Streamlining and securing software update delivery
- Conducting thorough risk analysis and maintaining documentation for extended support periods
- Enforcing code integrity and data stream encryption

These changes encourage teams to strengthen dependency management, automate compliance operations, and prioritize separation of security updates from feature deployments. Wider adoption reduces technical debt, increases resilience, and builds trust with users.

## Industry Community Response

The Open Regulatory Compliance (ORC) Working Group, hosted by the Eclipse Foundation, delivers resources to support CRA compliance, collaborating with technology leaders like Microsoft, GitHub, and Red Hat. ORC provides:

- Specifications, best practices, and reference materials
- Dialogue with regulators, open source foundations, and industry
- Ongoing support for SMEs and large organizations

## Call to Action

With regulatory deadlines approaching, organizations should align workflows, integrate compliance into development pipelines, and connect with industry initiatives like ORC. The CRA offers a unique opportunity to embed security into daily software practice.
