# Reimagine Migration: Agentic Platform Landing Zone with Azure Migrate

**Author: Thomas Maurer**

Migrating workloads to Azure can be complex, but combining Azure Migrate with a properly architected platform landing zone streamlines this process. This walkthrough covers the agentic approach, emphasizing governance, automation, and security for modern Azure migrations.

## Challenges in Traditional Cloud Migration

- Manual or ad-hoc processes often cause:
  - Inconsistent workloads
  - Missing security and identity configurations
  - Difficulties in management and compliance
- The cost of mistakes includes wasted troubleshooting and audit cycles, and cloud environments not meeting ROI expectations.

## The Agentic Migration Approach

### Azure Migrate + Platform Landing Zone

- **Azure Migrate** assists with:
  - Discovery and assessment of on-prem servers, databases, and web apps
  - Migration into Azure via automation
  - [Microsoft Docs: Azure Migrate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/?view=migrate)
- **Azure Landing Zone (ALZ)** provides:
  - Identity and access management
  - Network topology and policies
  - Shared services for monitoring, logging, compliance
  - [Microsoft Docs: Landing Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/)

By integrating these, organizations ensure migrations are not only fast and automated, but land into environments designed for scalability and compliance.

### Key Benefits

- **Consistency & Governance**: Pre-configured landing zones prevent configuration drift and enforce standards by default.
- **Automation & Speed**: Use infrastructure-as-code or portal accelerators for repeatable landing zone setups.
- **Scale & Flexibility**: Supports multiple subscriptions/environments with a consistent baseline.
- **Security & Compliance Baked In**: Identity, networking, monitoring, and policy enforcement from the outset.
- **Simplified Planning**: Central evaluation hub for cost and workload readiness.

## Migration Considerations

- **Workload Readiness**: Assess dependencies, compatibility, and necessary changes before migration.
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Use VPN or ExpressRoute for legacy/on-prem integration post-migration.
- **Organizational Coordination**: Platform teams manage shared resources, app teams work within segmented landing zones.

## Modernize with Confidence

- Treat landing zones as foundational, not one-off projects, enabling future growth and robust cloud-native architectures.
- Agentic migrations combine technical best practices with enterprise requirements for governance and operational scale.
