# Survey Reveals Challenges in DevOps Platform Migrations and AI Tool Integration

**Author:** Mike Vizard

A survey of 300 enterprise IT and technology leaders, conducted by TrendCandy for CloudBees, reveals that migrating DevOps platforms is fraught with unexpected challenges and unmet expectations.

## Key Findings

- **Migration Prevalence:** 85% of respondents' organizations migrated DevOps platforms in the past two years.
- **Costs and Overruns:** 57% spent over $1 million per migration; average cost was $1.75 million with projects running 18% over budget.
- **Value Realization:** Only 25% believe platform consolidation delivered value within a year, and just 21% saw improved cycle times.
- **Performance and Productivity:** 94% saw equal or worse system performance; 61% report 'migration fatigue' causing significant project delays. Developer burnout (70%) and decreased morale (76%) are common.

## Tool Sprawl and Security Impacts

- **Tool Sprawl:** 74% note an increase in tool sprawl after migrations.
- **Security and Compliance:** Three quarters (75%) find security integrations harder to maintain post-migration, while 40% discovered new compliance blind spots.

## The AI Factor

- **AI Tools Pressure:** 70% say business leaders introduce AI tools into pipelines without security reviews, heightening technical debt and risk.
- **Analytics Preferences:** 92% saw better delivery efficiency by integrating tools instead of replacing them, and real-time analytics are easier to adopt when avoiding major platform changes.

## Lessons Learned

- **Migration Alternatives:** Most now prioritize improvement of existing workflows over disruptive migrations.
- **Platform Engineering:** Adoption of platform engineering is on the rise for managing DevOps workflows at scale.

## Conclusion

The survey emphasizes a gap between DevOps transformation ambitions and real outcomes, highlighting issues that organizations face—from budget overruns and tool sprawl to burnout, compliance risks, and challenges managing AI in the pipeline. Teams are encouraged to focus on optimizing current DevOps practices, integrate new tools thoughtfully (especially AI), and prioritize security reviews and developer experience.
