Dellenny highlights seven under-the-radar Azure services that can transform your cloud strategy, from enhanced security with Sentinel to automation with Logic Apps.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Top 7 Azure Services You Didn’t Know You Needed

**Author:** Dellenny  

Microsoft Azure isn’t just about virtual machines, databases, and storage. It offers a suite of lesser-known services that can transform operations, improve security, and enable automation for developers, IT leaders, and entrepreneurs. Here’s a rundown of seven powerful Azure services you might not be using yet:

## 1. Azure Cognitive Search

Create enterprise-grade search solutions for documents, PDFs, and images—all searchable with natural language. With built-in AI, you can extract insights from unstructured data, making it ideal for customer support, knowledge bases, or internal documentation.

- **Use case:** Turn hundreds of PDFs into a fast, searchable knowledge center.

## 2. Azure Chaos Studio

Practice chaos engineering safely by simulating real-world outages like network failures or resource bottlenecks. Chaos Studio helps identify weaknesses and build resilience into your systems.

- **Use case:** Test your disaster recovery plan by simulating live failures.

## 3. Azure Bastion

Securely connect to virtual machines through the Azure portal via RDP/SSH without exposing public IP addresses. Bastion eliminates the need for jump boxes or open inbound ports, reducing your attack surface.

- **Use case:** Manage production VMs securely without VPNs or open ports.

## 4. Azure App Configuration

Centralize application settings and feature flags. Easily manage and roll out new features across distributed microservices and integrate with your CI/CD workflows for gradual releases.

- **Use case:** Launch a new feature to a subset of users, then extend based on feedback.

## 5. Azure Sentinel

A cloud-native Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool that uses AI for real-time detection, investigation, and incident response. Integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365, Azure, and third-party services.

- **Use case:** Detect and respond to suspicious login attempts instantly.

## 6. Azure Monitor Application Insights

Gain real-time visibility into application performance, user behavior, and errors. Application Insights offers dashboarding, built-in anomaly detection, and action-oriented analytics.

- **Use case:** Monitor and fix web app performance bottlenecks before end users notice.

## 7. Azure Logic Apps

Automate workflows across cloud and on-premises services with a drag-and-drop interface. Logic Apps connect disparate systems without extensive code, streamlining business processes.

- **Use case:** Automate HR onboarding using Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint integrations.

Azure’s full potential goes beyond its core infrastructure services. By taking advantage of these lesser-known tools, you can enhance your cloud’s intelligence, security, and productivity. Give one a try in your next project—these hidden gems may become essentials in your toolset.
