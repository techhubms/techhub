# How AI Is Changing the SDLC: Trust, Ownership, and Community

**Host:** Matt “Matty” Stratton  
**Guests:** Hannah Foxwell, Robert Werner  
**Podcast:** Arrested DevOps

## Introduction

The integration of AI into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is accelerating changes across development and operations. In this roundtable, experts discuss how these shifts echo the early days of agile, cloud, and DevOps transformations, but bring new challenges around trust, ownership, documentation, and velocity.

---

## Key Themes

### 1. The Trust Problem in AI for Software Development

- In each major technological shift, teams have had to renegotiate **trust**. Now, AI agents are core to the SDLC, creating new “black box” challenges.
- Hannah draws parallels with DevOps: “Testers didn’t trust devs; ops didn’t trust testers; now we’re asking if we can trust AI agents.”
- Robert highlights that management must again push trust to the edges as with previous cloud and DevOps adoptions.

### 2. The AI Fluency Gap

- Many teams struggle simply to speak a shared language about AI.
- Hannah’s “AI for the Rest of Us” community was created to foster practical understanding without dumbing-down technical rigor.
- Developing fluency is essential for good decision-making around AI adoption.

### 3. The Speed-Responsibility Paradox

- AI-enabled development is progressing faster than guardrails or best practices can be established.
- As companies push for rapid AI adoption, developers may “tick the box” for AI usage, regardless of utility—echoing past perverse incentives in agile and DevOps (e.g., adding meaningless tests to pass sprints).
- The result can be untrusted or misunderstood code that becomes a liability.

### 4. Who Owns AI-Generated Code?

- If AI produces code, who is responsible for its correctness, operation, and maintenance?
- Hannah notes the risk of a new “wall of confusion” where code is thrown from AI to ops with limited understanding.
- Robert asserts that human responsibility and verification will remain essential, and that AI code review tools must focus on making this process as efficient as possible.

### 5. Documentation and AI

- Effective AI agents need excellent, accurate documentation—reinforcing classic DevOps best practices.
- However, AI-generated docs are often unreliable and can amplify misunderstandings if not human-reviewed for accuracy.

### 6. Lessons from Past Transformations

- Guardrails enable confident experimentation and safety.
- Making “the right way the easy way” is key to successful transformations.
- Community learning and shared stories of success and failure accelerate progress.
- Teams with strong engineering fundamentals (deploy safety nets, A/B testing, blameless postmortems) are best-positioned to safely leverage AI.

### 7. Practical Guidance for AI Explorers

- Keep your eyes open to emerging patterns—see who’s successful and why.
- Engage with technical community for honest experience-sharing.
- Focus on quality information sources and avoid hype cycles.
- Practice hands-on regularly to keep pace with rapid change.
- Use AI on well-scoped, explicit tasks for best results; vagueness leads to frustration.

## Conclusion

AI is at the forefront of a new transformation in software development—one where trust, ownership, and human oversight are as critical as ever. Teams that cultivate AI fluency, invest in community, and preserve strong engineering practices will be best equipped to adopt these new tools thoughtfully and safely as the field matures.
