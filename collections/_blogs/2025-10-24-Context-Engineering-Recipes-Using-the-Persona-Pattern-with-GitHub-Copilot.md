# Context Engineering Recipes: The Persona Pattern

**Author:** Randy Pagels

This guide introduces the Persona Pattern for GitHub Copilot, demonstrating how developers can steer Copilot's responses by assigning it a clear role. This context engineering technique helps make Copilot's answers more specialized, relevant, and effective depending on your development needs.

## What Is the Persona Pattern?

The Persona Pattern is a prompt design approach where you instruct Copilot to act from a specific perspective. By giving Copilot a defined role or area of expertise, you:

- Adjust its tone and vocabulary
- Influence its problem-solving approach
- Receive answers that match particular contexts (development, testing, documentation, etc.)

## Practical Persona Examples

### 1. Developer Persona

- **Prompt:** `Act as a senior JavaScript developer. Refactor this function for readability and performance.`
- **When to use:** Code modernization, syntax cleanups, performance improvements.

### 2. Reviewer Persona

- **Prompt:** `Act as a code reviewer. Check this function for edge cases and maintainability.`
- **When to use:** Surfacing issues before formal code reviews.

### 3. Tester Persona

- **Prompt:** `Act as a QA engineer. Suggest Playwright tests to verify the login flow.`
- **When to use:** Expanding test coverage and identifying missing scenarios.

### 4. Documentation Persona

- **Prompt:** `Act as a technical writer. Explain how this API method works with example usage.`
- **When to use:** Generating clear technical explanations, documentation, onboarding, and training materials.

## Quick Tips

- If Copilot's suggestions start feeling repetitive, try switching its persona to gain new perspectives. For example, a security analyst persona may highlight different issues compared to a performance engineer.
- The sharper and clearer you define the role, the more focused and helpful Copilot's response will be.

## Takeaway

The Persona Pattern empowers you to guide GitHub Copilot by providing a specific viewpoint, as suited for your development task. Use this technique in Chat, Edit Mode, or Agent Mode to get more relevant and specialized AI assistance.
