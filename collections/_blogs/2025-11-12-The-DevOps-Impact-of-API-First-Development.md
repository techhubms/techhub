# The DevOps Impact of API-First Development

Alan Shimel interviews Balaji Raghavan, Postman's CTO, on key trends from Postman's 7th Annual State of the API Report. The conversation centers on APIs as strategic enablers in modern DevOps and software development, far beyond their original role as integration tools.

## Key Insights

- **APIs as Strategic Enablers:** APIs now serve as the backbone of digital transformation, connecting distributed systems, streamlining development, and accelerating delivery across virtually all software organizations.
- **Rise of API-First Development:** API-first approaches are gaining momentum, emphasizing governance and lifecycle management as API ecosystems scale in complexity and size.
- **Security and Multi-Cloud Challenges:** Teams face increasing challenges around API security, version control, and dependency management as APIs expand into multi-cloud environments.
- **AI in API Design and Testing:** Emerging use of AI is improving API design, testing, and monitoring, allowing DevOps teams to embed automation and observability into their daily workflows.
- **Collaboration Across Teams:** Successful API-driven organizations prioritize shared visibility and collaboration among developers, platform engineers, and security teams.
- **Developer Experience as a Differentiator:** Investing in developer experience, automation, and governance is critical for organizations to manage API complexity and thrive.

## For DevOps Teams

- Embed API observability and automation inside DevOps pipelines.
- Prioritize governance and security throughout the API lifecycle.
- Foster cross-functional collaboration for shared visibility.
