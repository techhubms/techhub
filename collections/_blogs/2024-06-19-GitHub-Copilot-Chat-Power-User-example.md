In this article, Rob Bos shares his experience leveraging GitHub Copilot Chat to streamline the development of a script designed for interacting with the GitHub API. Rob explains his workflow, detailing the prompts he used and the iterative nature of working with Copilot. <!--excerpt_end--> He openly discusses how initial attempts with Copilot did not yield perfect results and highlights the importance of refining prompts to achieve more accurate, effective code generation.

Rob provides an end-to-end walkthrough, showcasing how Copilot can generate a working script that performs API calls in a loop over an input file. The script not only retrieves data from the API but also summarizes the results and computes both per-item and overall averages within the loop. The article includes both the successful and less successful Copilot interactions, illustrating practical prompt engineering and insights into optimizing AI tool usage for automation and programming tasks.
