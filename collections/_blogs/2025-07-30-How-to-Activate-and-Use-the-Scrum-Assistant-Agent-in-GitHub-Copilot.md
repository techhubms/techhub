# How to Activate and Use the Scrum Assistant Agent in GitHub Copilot

Agile teams are always seeking ways to streamline their rituals and automate repetitive work. With GitHub Copilot’s built-in **Scrum Assistant agent**, AI-driven facilitation can now be integrated directly into your standups, retros, and planning sessions.

## What Is the Scrum Assistant Agent?

The **Scrum Assistant agent** is an AI-powered feature in GitHub Copilot, designed to act like a virtual Scrum Master for developer teams. Its capabilities include:

- Drafting user stories and acceptance criteria
- Tracking and summarizing daily standups
- Flagging blockers or impediments
- Assisting with backlog grooming
- Preparing retrospective summaries
- Recommending sprint goals

This agent functions inside Copilot Chat and Copilot Workspace, making it easy for teams to interact with and automate project rituals within their chosen development environment.

## How to Activate the Scrum Assistant Agent

Some features may be in progressive rollout. If you don’t see the Scrum Assistant, follow these steps:

### 1. Join the Copilot Workspace Beta (If Required)

- Visit [GitHub Copilot features](https://github.com/features/copilot).
- Request access to Copilot Workspace, or enable preview features in your GitHub account settings.

### 2. Enable Agents in Copilot Chat

- Open Copilot Chat in VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, or via GitHub.com.
- Use the agents menu or prompt bar to select **Scrum Assistant** from available agents.
- Optionally provide context like your project name, sprint cadence, or backlog data.

Once activated, you can interact with the agent on a daily basis.

## Using the Scrum Assistant for Agile Rituals

### Examples of Practical Prompts

**Daily Standup:**

```bash
@ScrumAssistant update my standup: I worked on the login feature yesterday, today I'm fixing OAuth bugs, and I'm blocked by missing test credentials.
```

*Result:* Copilot logs your progress and identifies blockers for the team.

**Drafting User Stories:**

```bash
@ScrumAssistant write a user story for adding password reset to the mobile app.
```

*Result:* Generates a formatted user story with acceptance criteria.

**Backlog Grooming:**

```bash
@ScrumAssistant review these tasks and suggest priorities.
```

*Result:* Analyzes tasks and recommends grooming actions.

**Sprint Retro Summary:**

```bash
@ScrumAssistant summarize team feedback from the last sprint and highlight areas to improve.
```

*Result:* Actionable retro summary for your next session.

## Pro Tips for Maximizing Value

- **Provide context:** Mention your team’s name, sprint goal, or project board for more relevant suggestions.
- **Embrace markdown:** Use structured lists and headers—Copilot handles them well.
- **Chat integration:** Some setups allow Scrum Assistant to post updates to Slack or Teams.
- **Iterative collaboration:** Follow up with prompts like “Expand this user story” or “Generate follow-up tasks.”

By embedding this agent in your pipeline, Agile teams can reduce meeting friction, accelerate planning, and improve clarity—focusing more energy on delivering real value.
