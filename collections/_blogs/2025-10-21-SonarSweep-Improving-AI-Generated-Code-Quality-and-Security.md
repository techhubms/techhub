Mike Vizard discusses how Sonar’s SonarSweep service helps AI development teams reduce bugs and vulnerabilities in AI-generated code, offering actionable insights for DevOps and security professionals.<!--excerpt_end-->

# SonarSweep: Improving AI-Generated Code Quality and Security

Sonar has announced SonarSweep, a service designed to enhance the quality of code produced by large language models (LLMs). This tool specifically seeks to tackle the high volume of security vulnerabilities and bugs commonly found in AI-generated code, offering organizations the ability to produce more reliable and secure software.

## Key Features and Approach

- **AI-Focused Code Quality**: SonarSweep analyzes code generated by AI models, identifying and mitigating issues such as bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Fits into modern DevSecOps workflows, supporting teams tasked with reviewing AI-generated code before production deployment.
- **Reinforcement Techniques**: Systematic remediation and optimization of code datasets used during AI model training, improving outcomes for organizations building or training custom models.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Helps organizations use earlier LLM versions for model training, potentially lowering the financial barrier to entry compared to newer, more complex models such as ChatGPT 5.
- **Wide Language Support**: Built upon Sonar's AI code review platform, already supporting over 35 languages and used by millions of developers worldwide.

## Impact on Organizations

- **Bug Reduction**: Potentially reduces bugs in AI-generated code by 42%.
- **Vulnerability Reduction**: Can cut down security vulnerabilities by up to 67%.
- **Scalability**: Supports large codebases and millions of daily code reviews.
- **Industry Adoption**: Already leveraged by major enterprises including Barclays, MasterCard, and T-Mobile.

## Considerations for DevOps and Security Teams

- As organizations increase their use of AI-generated code, the need for robust review and remediation becomes critical.
- SonarSweep’s reinforcement and review capabilities may allow DevOps teams to confidently train and deploy purpose-built AI models for specific industry requirements.
- While costs and resource requirements remain a factor, tools like SonarSweep can make internal model development more feasible for large-scale enterprises.
