# How to Enable Ransomware Protection in Windows 11

Ransomware attacks can lock or encrypt your files, demanding a ransom to restore access. Fortunately, Windows 11 includes built-in protection through **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**. To maximize your system's defenses, you should manually enable ransomware protection. This guide by Dellenny shows you how to do just that.

## Step 1: Open Windows Security

- Click the **Start Menu** and type **Windows Security**.
- Select the **Windows Security** app.

## Step 2: Go to Virus & Threat Protection

- In the Windows Security window, choose **Virus & threat protection**.
- Scroll to the **Ransomware protection** section.

## Step 3: Enable Controlled Folder Access

- Click **Manage ransomware protection** under the Ransomware protection section.
- Toggle **Controlled folder access** to **On**.
- This setting blocks unauthorized apps from making changes to your protected files.

## Step 4: Add Protected Folders (Optional)

- Windows protects common folders (Documents, Pictures, Videos, Desktop) by default.
- For extra safety, click **Protected folders** and **Add a protected folder** to include additional locations.

## Step 5: Allow Trusted Applications

- If legitimate apps are blocked, click **Allow an app through Controlled folder access**.
- Add any trusted programs required for your workflow.

## Extra Tip: Integrate OneDrive File Recovery

- Enable OneDrive file recovery for easier file restoration if ransomware strikes.
- With OneDrive backups, you can easily roll back affected files to previous versions.

By enabling ransomware protection and configuring controlled folder access, you put strong defenses in place to keep your important files secure. These simple steps can make a big difference in preventing data loss from ransomware attacks.
