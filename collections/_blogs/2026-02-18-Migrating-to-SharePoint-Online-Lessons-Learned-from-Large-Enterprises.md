# Migrating to SharePoint Online: Lessons Learned from Large Enterprises

**Author:** John Edward  
**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Platform:** SharePoint, Microsoft 365

Modern enterprises are increasingly leaving legacy on-premises SharePoint environments behind in favor of SharePoint Online, reaping the benefits of scalability, security, and integrated collaboration in the cloud. However, the path to a successful migration is paved with both technical and organizational challenges. Below are key takeaways for teams embarking on this journey:

## 1. Migration is an Organizational Shift

- Migration affects collaboration culture as much as technology
- Success comes from involving stakeholders across departments (HR, Legal, Compliance, Business Units)

## 2. Pre-Migration Cleanup is Essential

- Archive obsolete data and eliminate duplications
- Streamline site architectures and update permission structures
- Standardize naming conventions to reduce post-migration clutter

## 3. Beware of Legacy Customizations

- Assess custom web parts, workflows, InfoPath forms, and third-party add-ins
- Many legacy solutions do not translate to SharePoint Online's architecture
- Modernize by leveraging new tools like Power Automate, Power Apps, and Teams integrations

## 4. Governance Should Precede Deployment

- Define site provisioning, ownership, metadata, sharing controls, and compliance policies
- Integrate governance for Teams, OneDrive, and other connected services

## 5. Rethink Security & Compliance

- Reevaluate data classification, retention, and access controls for the cloud
- Map existing compliance and audit requirements to SharePoint Online equivalents
- Understand that security is a shared responsibility in the cloud

## 6. User Training Drives Adoption

- Invest in role-based training, internal power users, and clear communications
- Highlight new features and benefits to ensure buy-in

## 7. Take a Phased Migration Approach

- Pilot with smaller groups before full rollout
- Use feedback from pilots to refine migration processes

## 8. Plan for Cloud Performance & Network Realities

- Assess network readiness and bandwidth for data transfer
- Consider latency, especially in multinational setups

## 9. Executive Sponsorship is Key

- C-level endorsement increases employee engagement and initiative visibility

## 10. Migration is Just the Beginning

- Continue optimizing, reviewing analytics, and governing post-migration
- Treat SharePoint Online as an evolving collaboration platform, not a project to check off

**Key Message:**  
Enterprises that treat migration as a strategic opportunity, not just a technical task, succeed in building a connected, future-ready digital workplace.
