# AppSignal Adds Native OpenTelemetry Support for Enhanced Application Monitoring

**Author: Mike Vizard**

AppSignal has announced the integration of native OpenTelemetry support into its application performance monitoring platform. OpenTelemetry, a CNCF-backed open source framework, enables broad instrumentation of applications for telemetry data collection.

According to Wes Oudshoorn, AppSignal’s chief product officer, the new implementation allows DevOps teams to add telemetry collection to Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, and Node.js applications using a single line of code. This zero-configuration model is designed to lower the barrier for organizations wanting to instrument applications and gain actionable insights in minutes.

Historically, the complexity of integrating telemetry limited organizations’ ability to monitor applications. AppSignal’s streamlined process now allows OpenTelemetry to be added quickly to any endpoint already monitored by the platform. This is timely, as the pace of application development is increasing, especially with AI tools generating more code, which increases the potential for performance or security issues.

Oudshoorn notes that AI-generated code is often verbose, raising the likelihood of issues that IT and software engineering teams will need to address. Small and medium organizations may prefer integrated platforms like AppSignal due to cost and manageability, especially as the scale of applications grows.

DevOps engineers are encouraged to proactively craft instrumentation and monitoring strategies to manage this new development reality. Oudshoorn emphasizes that existing incident response workflows might not scale, but advances in AI could equip IT teams with tools to rise to future challenges as code and complexity grow.

## Key Takeaways

- **OpenTelemetry** enables fast, code-light instrumentation for observability.
- **Supported languages** include Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, Elixir, and Node.js.
- **DevOps impact**: Easier, broader observability for issue resolution and performance tracking.
- **AI implications**: More code = more need for scalable monitoring.
- **Strategic advice**: Teams should exploit new monitoring integrations as software and system complexity increases.
