# Video: Build a Well-Architected SaaS Solution on Microsoft Azure

**By Thomas Maurer**

In this episode of the Azure Essentials Show, Thomas Maurer is joined by Sergio Navar and John Downs for an in-depth look at applying the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework when building Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions on Microsoft Azure.

## About the Show

The session is designed to help independent software vendors (ISVs) understand and apply best practices for designing and scaling SaaS workloads. The discussion centers around the five pillars of the Microsoft Well-Architected Framework:

1. **Security**: Approaches for ensuring data protection, robust identity management, and compliance to industry standards.
2. **Cost Optimization**: Strategies for managing resources efficiently to minimize operational expenditures.
3. **Reliability**: Methods for achieving high availability, disaster recovery, and consistent performance.
4. **Operational Excellence**: Tactics for optimizing deployment, streamlining monitoring, and automating operations.
5. **Performance Efficiency**: How to optimize workloads for responsiveness, speed, and elastic scalability.

The guests provide insight into real-world design considerations, including financial structures and multi-tenancy models. There is an emphasis on how ISVs must balance trade-offs between technical requirements, customer needs, and business goals.

## What is SaaS?

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** is a cloud computing model where applications are hosted by a third-party provider and delivered to customers over the internet. Users access these tools via a web browser, and do not need to install or maintain software locally.

### Key SaaS Features

- **Subscription-Based**: Users pay recurring fees for access.
- **Accessible Anywhere**: Web-based access from any device with internet.
- **Automatic Updates**: Provider handles maintenance and new releases.
- **Scalability**: Usage can be increased or decreased as needed.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Multiple customers use the same software, but their data remains separate.

Common examples include Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, OneDrive, and Salesforce.

## Building Well-Architected SaaS Solutions on Azure

The **Azure Well-Architected Framework for SaaS** offers a comprehensive set of recommendations to help ISVs create secure, robust, and cost-effective SaaS applications. The discussion covers:

- How to balance resource costs and efficiency while maintaining key requirements for availability and performance
- Trade-offs between centralized and multi-tenant architectures
- Meeting both business objectives and customer expectations

## Learning Resources

To support architects and developers, several helpful resources and assessments are mentioned:
