# Survey Highlights Challenges and Opportunities in Software Engineering and DevOps

**Author:** Mike Vizard  

A recent [survey by Chainguard](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chainguard-research-shows-engineers-struggle-with-burnout-maintenance-and-tool-sprawl-despite-ai-gains-302577843.html), covering 600 software engineers and 600 senior technology leaders across the US, UK, Germany, and France, reveals that software engineers face significant hurdles to productivity and satisfaction:

## Key Findings

- **Time Constraints**: Nearly three-quarters of engineers report that productivity demands limit their capacity to build new features. Most spend only 16% of their week on core development tasks.
- **Burnout & Workload**: 35% say excessive workload and burnout are major obstacles. Only a third feel energized by their main activities, despite widespread automation.
- **Tool Integration Issues**: 62% say engineering tools lack full integration into their workflows, leading to friction and productivity drains.
- **AI's Modest Impact**: While 89% of respondents say AI saves them at least three hours weekly, only 28% recover as much as six hours. The adoption of AI has not radically changed overall productivity.
- **Context Switching**: 88% of engineers highlight that switching tools disrupts focus, with 44% suffering significant productivity loss as a result.

## Barriers to Meaningful Work

- **Tedious Tasks**: 38% cite repetitive work as a barrier.
- **Code Maintenance**: Another 38% highlight ongoing tasks like upgrades, patching, and vulnerability management as obstacles.
- **Technical Debt**: Two-thirds frequently encounter technical debt that hampers delivery.
- **Tool-Related Challenges**: Almost half point to tool issues as a negative impact on their work experience.

## DevOps and the Future

Dustin Kirkland of Chainguard notes that the developer experience suffers from fragmented DevOps workflows. Automation helps but lack of unified tooling continues to impede progress. The expectation is that as AI-driven solutions become more autonomous and better integrated, improvements in developer satisfaction and productivity should follow.

_The article concludes that despite advances in automation and the introduction of AI, core developer experience issues—primarily related to workflow inefficiencies and tool fragmentation—persist. The path forward lies in addressing these foundational DevOps challenges to unlock both human potential and the full promise of AI._
