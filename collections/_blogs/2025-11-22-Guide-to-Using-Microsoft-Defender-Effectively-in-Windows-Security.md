# Guide to Using Microsoft Defender Effectively in Windows Security

By [John Edward](https://dellenny.com/author/delenyprogmail-com/)

Windows now offers a built-in security suite with Windows Security and Microsoft Defender Antivirus, eliminating the need for third-party antivirus software. This guide outlines practical steps and features to protect your PC efficiently.

## Key Features of Windows Security

### Main Dashboard

- **How to Access:** Search for "Windows Security" in Start menu.
- **Overview:** Provides a control center for antivirus, firewall, and app protection.

### Virus & Threat Protection

- **Real-Time Protection:** Continuously monitors files, apps, and websites (should be on 24/7).
- **Cloud-Delivered Protection:** Leverages Microsoft's global intelligence network for up-to-date threat coverage.
- **Manual Scans:**
  - Quick Scan: Weekly or when suspicious files are present.
  - Full Scan: Periodic deep checks, best performed off-hours.
  - Custom Scan: Targeted checks on specific files/folders.

### Ransomware Protection

- **Controlled Folder Access:** Only approved apps can alter protected files. Add crucial folders manually.
- **Backup:** Regularly back up irreplaceable data—integrates with OneDrive and other options.

### App & Browser Control

- **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen:** Warns against known malicious files, apps, and websites. Activated for Microsoft Edge and other browsers.
- **Exploit Protection:** Safeguards system memory and core processes from advanced attacks.

### Firewall & Network Protection

- **Windows Firewall:** Active by default on domain, private, and public networks.
- **App Permissions:** Allow trusted apps through the firewall if needed—exercise caution.

### Updates

- **Definition Updates:** Automatic delivery of new virus signatures via cloud protection.
- **Windows Updates:** Regular OS patches seal vulnerabilities—should not be deferred.

## Best Practices

1. Make sure real-time protection is always ON.
2. Enable cloud-delivered protection for immediate threat response.
3. Use Controlled Folder Access to shield critical files.
4. Confirm firewall is active across all network profiles.
5. Keep Windows and definitions updated for maximum security.

By following these steps, you transform Windows Security into an active, intelligent guardian for your PC. Stay up-to-date and regularly review security settings to maintain strong protection.
