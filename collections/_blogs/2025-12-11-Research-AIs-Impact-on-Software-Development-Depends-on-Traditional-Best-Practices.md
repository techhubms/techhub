# Research: AI's Impact on Software Development Depends on Traditional Best Practices

## Overview

This article summarizes recent research into AI's influence on software development productivity from Atlassian’s DX, Google DORA, and LaunchDarkly. The consensus: while AI tools can write large quantities of code and speed up certain developer tasks, the actual impact on teams varies widely and continues to be shaped by longstanding software development best practices.

## Key Findings

- **AI Increases Code Output, but Results Vary**: Atlassian’s DX platform analyzed data from over 135,000 developers across 400 customers. While AI tools can boost productivity, the degree of improvement (or detriment) hinges on company practices. Some organizations saw 20%+ gains in change confidence, while others suffered setbacks.

- **Classic Best Practices Still Reign**: Effectively integrating AI into development workflows depends on fundamentals like good SDLC processes, code hygiene, and team psychological safety. These factors mattered before AI came along and remain central even now.

- **Code Quality Sees Modest Gains**: Google’s DORA 2025 report found only a 2.6% average improvement in code quality post-AI adoption, with minimal effect on change failure rates.

- **The Human Element and Team Dynamics**: The research highlights that junior developers are the heaviest AI users, but senior engineers save the most time due to their experience. Psychological safety and solid team practices remain the most important factors for delivering value.

- **AI’s Actual Productivity Savings**: While code completion and stack trace analysis with AI save developers about 3.8 hours a week, broader workflow issues (like too many meetings or slow reviews) remain bigger obstacles for productivity.

- **Programming Language Differences**: Gains from AI vary by language. Go developers save more time than those using COBOL, as modern languages are better supported by AI tools.

- **Pull Requests and Code Slop**: AI users ship 60% more pull requests, but value depends on context and oversight—quality assurance processes still matter.

- **Non-Developers Writing Code**: AI is enabling more non-traditional contributors (like designers and managers) to produce code, sometimes for prototypes rather than production.

- **Learning Impacts**: Concerns exist that reliance on AI could hamper skill development, but this reflects user choices, mirroring earlier debates about copy-pasting from Stack Overflow.

- **Team Environment is Still Key**: According to Atlassian’s Justin Reock, psychological safety within teams underpins successful AI augmentation.

## AI-Assisted Development Use Cases (per DX Research)

- Stack trace analysis
- Automated code completion
- Accelerated pull request creation
- Addressing code maintainability and hygiene

## Takeaway

Generative AI is a powerful tool in software development, but its benefits are not automatic. Organizations that emphasize classic development fundamentals—process, team communication, and code quality—are better positioned to leverage AI’s strengths while minimizing its risks.
