Alan Shimel shares perspectives from industry leaders on how organizations are building trust and governance into AI-driven DevOps transformations, with a focus on productivity, security, and strategic alignment.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Bringing Trust and Governance to AI-Driven DevOps

At the swampUP 2025 conference in Napa Valley, Alan Shimel hosted a discussion with three prominent figures shaping the future of AI in DevOps: Rahul Tripathi (ServiceNow), Justin Boitano (NVIDIA), and Shlomi Ben Haim (JFrog).

## Industry Perspectives on AI and DevOps

- **Rahul Tripathi (ServiceNow)** highlighted how grounding product strategy in practitioner experience is vital for real-world IT Service Management (ITSM), noting AI's growing influence on productivity and security across IT operations.
- **Justin Boitano (NVIDIA)** reflected on the evolution from early GPU computing initiatives to current enterprise AI frameworks, emphasizing collaboration across the industry and the embedding of AI at each step of the development lifecycle.
- **Shlomi Ben Haim (JFrog)** addressed the enterprise urgency around AI adoption (“AI FOMO”), with increasing board-level investment and the growing need to embed AI into software supply chains. JFrog’s focus is on governance, traceability, and the secure adoption of AI agents.

## Key Themes

- **AI as a Transformative Force**: The panelists agreed AI is already reshaping workflows and tooling in DevOps, even as it doesn’t replace developers outright. Instead, it changes expectations on productivity and alters the economics of software delivery.
- **Trust and Governance**: Success with AI in DevOps will require moving beyond hype to focus on trust, verification, and sustainable practices, particularly around governance, traceability, and resilience.
- **Ecosystem Partnerships**: Collaboration among platform providers like ServiceNow, NVIDIA, and JFrog is essential in providing robust AI-driven solutions for complex enterprise needs.

## Conclusion

The discussion underscores that integrating AI into DevOps is about careful alignment with organizational trust models and governance frameworks, ensuring that innovation does not compromise security or reliability.
