BMC has announced enhancements to its DevOps analytics solutions for mainframe environments, with several new capabilities designed to streamline development workflows, enhance security, and support hybrid infrastructure operations.

## Key Updates

### Enhanced DevOps Analytics with Git Integration

- **BMC AMI zAdviser Enterprise**, the company's analytics platform tailored for mainframe environments, can now collect and analyze Git usage data.
- This integration aims to simplify the identification of workflow bottlenecks and other inefficiencies in the development pipeline, supporting improved collaboration between teams managing distributed and mainframe systems.

### AI-Powered Operations Support

- BMC has introduced, in beta, the **BMC AMI Assistant** tool.
- This solution provides IT teams with a natural language chat interface, leveraging a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model trained by BMC.
- The assistant is designed to help optimize operations by providing actionable insights, recommendations, and task automation opportunities.

### Improved Security with Okta Integration

- New connectors for Okta’s identity management platform are now available, enabling tighter security controls and enhanced protection for software supply chains within mainframe DevOps workflows.

### Cloud Data Management and Advanced Protections

- **BMC AMI Cloud**, the data management platform, now supports:
    - Enforced password and IBM zMFA token entry for enhanced access control.
    - Advanced support for protecting both on-premises and public cloud object storage data.
    - Multi-volume capabilities, allowing for storage of up to 255TB in data sets within cloud object storage services.

## Strategic Impact and Market Context

John McKenny, Executive Vice President and General Manager of BMC's mainframe business unit, highlighted:

- The importance of extending DevOps workflows to mainframe systems, which still run many mission-critical applications.
- The pressure to modernize these environments due to the demand for rapid application updates, as seen in distributed computing.
- The emergence of Java and Linux on mainframes, bridging traditional and modern application ecosystems.

## The Role of Artificial Intelligence

The article notes:

- The blending of distributed and mainframe environments is further catalyzed by the adoption of AI technologies.
- AI-powered agents can offload manual and tedious IT operations tasks, addressing talent shortages and reducing burnout as experienced mainframe professionals retire.
- Teams are encouraged to inventory and automate repetitive tasks, focusing human expertise on value-added activities and oversight.

## Takeaway

BMC’s new capabilities target organizations seeking a unified approach to DevOps across hybrid infrastructure, integrating modern workflows, security, and AI-driven automation for resilient and efficient operations.
