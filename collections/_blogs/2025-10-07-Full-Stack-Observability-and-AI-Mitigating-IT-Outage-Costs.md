James Maguire summarizes a New Relic survey on the value of full-stack observability and AI-driven monitoring in cutting IT outage costs, with insights into productivity, incident detection, and enterprise tooling strategies.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Full-Stack Observability and AI: Mitigating IT Outage Costs

**Author:** James Maguire  

## Overview

A recent global survey by New Relic exposes the high cost of IT outages, with the median price tag at $2 million per hour and a median annual impact of $76 million. These costs arrive as organizations increasingly depend on distributed, software-intensive stacks powered by modern AI, including large language models (LLMs) and agentic services.

## Key Survey Findings

- Survey sampled 1,700 IT and engineering leaders/practitioners across 23 countries and 11 industries.
- High-impact outages are costly and frequent, especially for organizations lacking comprehensive observability.

### Full-Stack Observability Defined

Full-stack observability is described as visibility across five technology layers:

- Infrastructure
- Applications & Services
- Security Monitoring
- Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)
- Log Management

**Benefits identified by the survey:**

- Organizations with full-stack observability cut outage costs in half (from $2M to $1M/hour).
- Only 23% of full-stack organizations report weekly high-impact outages (versus 40% without).
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) improves to 28 minutes, 7 minutes faster than less mature peers.
- Causes for outages typically include network failures, third-party/cloud service issues, and software changes.

### Productivity Impact & Tooling Strategies

- Engineers report spending ~33% of time on break-fix work, impacting productivity and feature development.
- Average number of observability tools per org dropped 27% since 2023; organizations are consolidating onto unified platforms.

### The Growing Role of AI in Observability

- Proliferation of LLM-powered and agentic apps increases silent failure risks.
- Organizations are increasingly monitoring AI with AI: adoption of AI monitoring tools rose from 42% in 2024 to 54% in 2025.
- Only 4% report they are not using or planning to use AI for monitoring.
- Top-valued AI capabilities for incident response:
  - AI-assisted troubleshooting
  - Automatic root-cause analysis
  - AI-assisted remediation
  - Predictive analytics
  - AI-generated post-incident reviews

### Business Case & ROI

- 68% of organizations with observability report faster incident response.
- 75% cite positive ROI; 18% claim 3–10x returns.
- Benefits for executives: reduced downtime, improved efficiency, and lower security risk.
- Practitioners report less alert fatigue, faster troubleshooting, and improved team collaboration.

## Implementation Checklist

To achieve full-stack observability:

- Instrument all five technology layers
- Correlate logs, traces, metrics, and user experience data
- Monitor both systems and AI models/agents explicitly
- Use AI tools to speed triage and remediation

**Conclusion:**
Full-stack observability, reinforced by AI-driven monitoring and analytics, offers concrete operational and financial benefits. It enables faster detection, reduces the frequency of high-impact incidents, and ultimately supports better customer experiences and business outcomes.
