# Surge in DevOps Platform Incidents: 2025 Mid-Year Analysis

Authored by Alan Shimel, this article examines data from GitProtect.io’s 'DevOps Threats Unwrapped: Mid-Year Report 2025', providing a technical assessment of rising incidents affecting critical DevOps tools.

## Key Findings from the Mid-Year Report

- **330 incidents** across GitHub, Azure DevOps, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Jira in the first half of 2025.
- Disruptions and outages significantly impacted developer velocity, CI/CD pipelines, and business continuity.

## Azure DevOps: Stability Concerns Deepen

- **74 incidents** recorded (Jan–Jun 2025), more than any other platform analyzed.
  - **Pipelines:** 31 disruptions (21% of issues)
  - **Boards:** 28 incidents
  - **Test Plans:** 28 incidents
  - **Repos:** 27 incidents
  - **Artifacts:** 6 incidents
  - **Core Services:** 16 incidents
- **Notable Event:** 159-hour global degradation in January, slowing builds and deployments.
- **Geographic Impact:** 34% of incidents in Europe; lower impact in India and Australia.

## GitHub: Major Rise in Operational Disruptions

- **109 incidents** (58% increase over H1 2024).
  - 17 major, 78 minor disruptions
  - Over **330 hours** of downtime in April
  - Both open source and enterprise repositories affected
- Reliability issues are impacting commit velocity and CI/CD reliability.

## GitLab and Jira: Data Breaches & Ransomware

- **GitLab:** 59 incidents (~1346 hours), including a major source code theft at Europcar Mobility Group affecting 200,000 customers.
- **Jira:** 66 incidents (24% YoY increase), 2,390+ hours of downtime, and new ransomware attacks targeting major enterprises (HellCat group, credential compromises).

## Security and Resilience Trends

- Increasing sophistication of ransomware and source code theft across the DevOps stack.
- Emphasis on moving beyond perimeter security toward self-healing infrastructure, observability, and fast recovery.
- The convergence of operational resilience and cybersecurity.

## Strategic Takeaways

- Outages and attacks on platforms like Azure DevOps and GitHub present not only operational, but also security and business risks.
- Organizations must anticipate failures, focus on backup/recovery, and integrate cybersecurity measures into DevOps workflows.
- CI/CD pipelines are now seen as critical attack surfaces.
