Mike Vizard analyzes survey findings about the widespread impact of vulnerable code on organizational security, including the challenge of AI-generated code, adoption of security tools, and the ongoing evolution of DevSecOps practices.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Most Organizations Face Breaches Caused by Vulnerable Code, Survey Finds

**Author:** Mike Vizard

A recent survey involving 1,519 application security stakeholders reveals alarming statistics regarding the prevalence and impact of vulnerable code:

## Key Findings

- **98%** of respondents report working at organizations that experienced a breach attributed to vulnerable code.
- **81%** admit to shipping code with known vulnerabilities to production.
- **27%** suffered four or more breaches due to these vulnerabilities.
- **38%** delivered vulnerable code due to pressures such as business needs or deadlines.

## Major Risk Factors

- **Top threat vectors for future incidents (next 18 months):**
  - Software supply chain compromises (35%)
  - Third-party vendor/partner incidents (35%)
  - Cloud infrastructure misconfigurations (34%)
  - Insider threats/privileged access misuse (33%)
  - API security breaches or business logic attacks (32%)

- **Emerging threats with low preparedness:**
  - Attacks on CI/CD pipelines (14%)
  - Attacks on development environments (14%)
  - Supply chain and upstream dependency threats (14%)
  - Advanced API and business logic exploits (13%)
  - Security risks from generative AI in development workflows (12%)

## Security Tool Adoption Gaps

- Less than 50% (excluding software development team leads) are using:
  - Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scanning tools (48%)
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools (47%)

## Developer Perspective and Organizational Challenges

- Developers often lack sufficient time to address security issues and face overwhelming numbers of alerts with little meaningful prioritization or risk context.
- Organizational pressure to deploy new features overrides thorough security review in many instances.

## AI-Driven Security and Code Generation

- The article references Checkmarx's release of the **Checkmarx One Developer Assist**, an AI-driven tool that integrates with IDEs to help developers address security risks in real time.
- Soon-to-launch Policy Assist and Insights Assist agents aim to improve software supply chain security further.

- Concerns are rising as AI-generated code becomes more common:
  - A third of surveyed developers said **over 60%** of their code is AI-generated.
  - Only 18% had organizational approval to use AI coding tools.
  - Much AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities, driven by flawed training data in large language models (LLMs).
  - 67% of all respondents say at least half of their applications’ codebase is open-source, introducing ongoing challenges for vulnerability management.

## Ongoing DevSecOps Progress

- Adoption of DevSecOps practices is advancing, but significant challenges in securing code and the broader software supply chain remain stagewide.

## Summary

Modern application security faces escalating vulnerabilities—amplified by AI-generated code, open-source adoption, and fast-moving DevOps environments. Organizations and developers must prioritize comprehensive security practices and tool adoption to address these enduring threats.
