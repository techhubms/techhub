# Pulumi Unveils AI Agents for Autonomous Infrastructure Automation

**Author:** Mike Vizard  

Pulumi has announced the preview release of Pulumi Neo, an expansion of its Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) platform that introduces a team of AI agents to help automate and optimize infrastructure management.

## Key Features of Pulumi Neo

- **AI Agents Trained on Infrastructure Data:** Pulumi Neo’s agents are built to diagnose issues, execute infrastructure changes, monitor results, and maintain compliance across the full lifecycle of cloud and on-premises resources.
- **Autonomous Task Execution:** The agents can operate autonomously—subject to permissions—automating routine or complex infrastructure tasks, and providing interactive guidance and approval workflows tailored to organizational policy.
- **Auditable Operations:** Pulumi Neo documents all actions performed, supporting compliance requirements and offering full historical traceability for regulatory and security purposes.
- **DevOps Integration:** Positioned as digital members of the DevOps or platform engineering team, the agents assist with provisioning, optimization, and compliance enforcement.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Integration with Pulumi's Model Context Protocol (MCP) server enables other AI coding tools to invoke Neo for building AI-driven workflows that align with best DevOps practices.

## Use Cases and Benefits

- **Infrastructure Automation:** Neo can optimize environments and even recommend migration of workloads (e.g., from Kubernetes to AWS ECS) based on detected patterns.
- **Productivity and Compliance:** Early users, such as Werner Enterprises, have reported significant reductions in provisioning times and improvements in shipping features, while maintaining compliance (e.g., SOC 2).
- **DevSecOps Considerations:** Automation includes oversight to prevent common misconfigurations and reinforce secure and compliant DevOps processes.

## Team Empowerment and Limitations

- DevOps teams remain in control, choosing between suggestion-only and autonomous execution modes. Neo supports both temporary and continuous automation based on trust and approval levels.
- Tasks performed by the agents can be reversed as needed—guarding against adverse outcomes from automated changes.

## Outlook

Although full adoption of AI-powered automation in platform engineering is still in early stages, Pulumi Neo’s capabilities illustrate a practical pathway toward reducing manual toil, improving compliance, and addressing security postures as organizations scale their cloud and infrastructure operations.
