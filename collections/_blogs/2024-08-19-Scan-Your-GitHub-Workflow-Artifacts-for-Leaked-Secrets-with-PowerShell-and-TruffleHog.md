## Scan Your GitHub Workflow Artifacts for Leaked Secrets

**Author:** Jesse Houwing

### Context

This article responds to [Major GitHub repos leak access tokens putting code and clouds at risk](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3487311/major-github-repos-leak-access-tokens-putting-code-and-clouds-at-risk.html?ref=jessehouwing.net). The referenced report highlights how build artifacts generated by GitHub Actions may inadvertently contain access tokens, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious code or compromise cloud infrastructure.

## PowerShell Script to Audit Secrets in GitHub Artifacts

To help address this risk, I (Jesse Houwing) created a PowerShell script that scans a GitHub organization or select repositories for accidentally leaked secrets within workflow run artifacts, using [TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog?ref=jessehouwing.net) as the secrets scanning engine.

### Script Dependencies

- **TruffleHog** (for secrets scanning)
- **GitHub CLI (gh)** (for authenticating and investigating within GitHub)
- **jq** (for working with paginated JSON responses)

### Script Overview

Below is the main PowerShell script (`scan-artifacts.ps1`).

```powershell
# Scan all your workflow runs for accidental leaks of secrets in artifacts

function scan-artifacts {
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [string]$org,
        [string[]]$repos
    )
    begin {
        if (($null -eq $repos) -and ($repos.Count -eq 0)) {
            $repos = get-repos -org $org
        }
    }
    process {
        foreach ($repo in $repos) {
            $downloaded = $false
            # Query all workflow runs for the repo
            write-host "$org/$repo"
            $workflowRuns = (& gh api /repos/$org/$($repo)/actions/runs --paginate --jq '.workflow_runs[].id' 2>$null | & jq -s | ConvertFrom-Json)

            # Query all artifacts for each workflow run
            foreach ($workflowRun in $workflowRuns) {
                $tempfolder = "./runs/$org/$repo/$workflowRun"

```

## How to Use

### 1. Save the Script

Save the script to a file named `scan-artifacts.ps1`.

### 2. Run the Script

To scan all repositories in an organization:

```pwsh
. .\scan-artifacts.ps1
scan-artifacts -org "your-org"
```

To scan specific repositories:

```pwsh
. .\scan-artifacts.ps1
scan-artifacts -org "your-org" -repos @("repo1", "repo2")
```

### 3. Exclude Paths to Reduce False Positives

Some directories, such as `/node_modules`, can generate excessive false positives. To exclude files or folders, add them (one regex per line) to `scan-artifacts-ignore.txt` in the script directory, for example:

```
/node_modules/
```

---

## Operational Notes

- The script downloads all workflow artifacts locally. For large orgs, this may require large amounts of disk space (e.g., 50GB).
- Previously scanned runs are skipped, allowing you to rerun and only fetch new data.
- If you want to remove scan results after processing, delete the `./runs` directory.

---

## Recommended Remediation Steps

1. **Rotate any secrets found.**
2. **Verify tokens have not been used to tamper with your code or artifacts.**
3. **Delete workflow runs containing exposed secrets.**
