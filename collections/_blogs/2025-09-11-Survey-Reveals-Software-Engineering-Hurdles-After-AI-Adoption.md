# Survey Reveals Software Engineering Hurdles After AI Adoption

**Author:** Mike Vizard

A recent survey involving 101 senior engineering leaders illustrates both high optimism and significant challenges in AI adoption for software engineering. While 87% of participants stated their organizations are prepared or very prepared for AI integration, the survey also uncovers several major obstacles:

- **Quality Assurance for AI Outputs:** Sixty-six percent say development teams lack adequate QA skills and expertise to validate AI-generated results.
- **Focus Shifts:** There is a growing emphasis on performance monitoring, system architecture, and integration skills as teams operationalize AI.
- **Strategic Risks:** Managing technical debt (27%) and defining a clear AI strategy (22%) are highlighted as dominant threats to realizing AI's potential.

## Key Survey Findings

- **Security Concerns:** Thirty percent point to data security and privacy as important risks tied to AI adoption.
- **Investment in Skills:** To overcome these challenges, leaders focus on reskilling employees (40%), hiring AI specialists (34%), and partnerships with vendors (22%).
- **Motivations for Adoption:** Operational efficiency (53%), innovation (40%), decision-making improvement (28%), and competitive advantage (23%) are main drivers for embracing AI.
- **Productivity Measurement Barriers:** While 66% track business outcomes, many teams still struggle to measure individual contributions and to connect those with broader business value.

## DevOps and SDLC Implications

Improving development tools and automation (27%), along with reducing technical debt (24%), are seen as top ways to drive productivity. Leaders note that AI should be woven into operational strategies across the SDLC, but caution that it can't simply solve entrenched bottlenecks or organizational issues overnight.

- Many teams still rely on outdated metrics (e.g., lines of code per developer) instead of business outcomes.
- Collaboration and system complexity are increasing challenges as AI accelerates code output.

## Practical Takeaways

- AI adoption in DevOps is ongoing, and teams should temper expectations about its immediate impact.
- A strong operational and measurement strategy, with a focus on overcoming technical debt and upskilling, is essential for successful AI integration.
- Organizational culture and engineering leadership must evolve alongside tooling for AI-driven transformation to realize its full value.
