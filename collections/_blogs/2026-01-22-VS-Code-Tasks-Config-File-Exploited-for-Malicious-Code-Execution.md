DevClass.com explores how attackers exploit VS Code's tasks.json files to deploy malicious code, emphasizing security risks, protections, and best practices for developers.<!--excerpt_end-->

# VS Code Tasks Config File Exploited for Malicious Code Execution

*By DevClass.com*

## Overview

Security researchers have identified a new tactic where attackers embed malicious commands in VS Code's `tasks.json` configuration file. When a developer opens a project folder in Visual Studio Code, the config can trigger automatic code execution with the user's privileges. This practice can lead to remote code execution, system fingerprinting, and persistent command and control (C2) connections.

## How the Exploit Works

- **tasks.json** is used to integrate command-line tools into the VS Code editor, executed via 'Run Task' commands or automatically on folder open.
- The file typically resides in the hidden `.vscode` directory at a project's root and allows per-OS command customization.
- Attackers plant code in repositories (often hosted on GitHub), setting up auto-run tasks that fetch malicious JavaScript (e.g., with `curl`), sometimes as part of fake recruitment or technical tests.

## Built-in Protections and Their Gaps

- **VS Code Protections:**
  - *Allow Automatic Tasks*: Defaults to on; governs whether tasks can execute automatically.
  - *Folder Trust Prompt*: VS Code marks folders untrusted by default; suspicious tasks will prompt a warning.
- **Design Flaws:**
  - The trust prompt visually emphasizes the "trust folder and continue" button, potentially encouraging unsafe approval.
  - Trust can be subtle: trusting a parent folder auto-trusts new subfolders, lowering security barriers.

## Attack Techniques

- Use of per-OS CLI commands (macOS, Windows, Linux) within `tasks.json`.
- External payload hosting (e.g., Vercel) to evade security scans.
- Removal of offending repositories post-discovery, but risk persists due to user behavior.

## Security Recommendations

- Always review repository contents, especially before trusting a folder.
- Favor ephemeral, containerized development environments to limit the impact of untrusted code.
- Be especially cautious when accessing repos for hiring tests, as these are common attack scenarios.
- Maintain up-to-date security awareness and monitor for advisories about editor or version control vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

While not a VS Code vulnerability per se, this issue underscores the importance of software supply chain security and cautious repository trust practices. The problem is compounded by design choices in developer tools that may inadvertently steer users towards risky actions.
