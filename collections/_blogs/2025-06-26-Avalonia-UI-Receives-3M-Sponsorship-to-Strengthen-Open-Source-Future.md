# Avalonia UI Receives $3M Sponsorship to Strengthen Open Source Future

**Author:** DevClass.com  
**Published:** June 26, 2025

## Overview

Avalonia UI, a popular open-source cross-platform UI framework for .NET developers, has secured a $3 million sponsorship from Devolutions, a company specializing in password management and remote desktop solutions. This funding spans three years and specifically supports Avalonia's open-source development under the MIT license. The goal is to remove the longstanding tension between sustaining the core open-source project and driving commercial initiatives.

## Key Details

- **Sponsorship**: Devolutions, based in Canada, provides the sponsorship conditional upon Avalonia's code remaining under an open MIT license.
- **Community Commitment**: The funding is earmarked for "activities that provide value to users and developers who utilise Avalonia without charge." Improvements resulting from commercial customer requests will also become available to all users of the Avalonia Core Framework when funded through this program.
- **Avalonia Company Growth**: The Estonia-based company behind Avalonia, led by CEO Mike James, reported significant revenue growth and will be expanding its team thanks to this funding boost.

## Open Source and Commercial Balance

- **Commercial Offerings**: The company sustains itself with commercial offerings, including Avalonia Accelerate (new WebView and media player components with enhanced paid versions) and XPF, a paid variant for greater WPF compatibility.
- **Impact of Sponsorship**: According to CEO Mike James, the sponsorship "completely removes" the conflict between open-source and commercial development efforts, enabling the team to deliver roadmap goals faster and benefit all developers.
- **Licensing Unchanged**: No changes to Avalonia Accelerate licensing are planned, but more developer resources will be focused on the open-source project.

## Community Reactions and Challenges

- **Community Concerns**: Some users are calling for proprietary Accelerate features to be merged back into the core project, reflecting continued tension over which features remain free.
- **Sustainability Commentary**: The article highlights that while the sponsorship is substantial, open-source sustainability remains a challenge and a healthy community ecosystem is still essential for Avalonia’s long-term viability.
- **Comparisons**: Avalonia UI is positioned alongside Microsoft MAUI and Blazor Hybrid, offering ease of migration from WPF without dependencies on WinUI or Mac Catalyst but with relatively weaker mobile support.
- **Ongoing Issues**: Documentation, tutorials, and advanced data grid controls remain areas for improvement in the open-source version.

## What Devolutions Receives

- Early access to the Avalonia roadmap
- Licenses for commercial Accelerate features
- A limited bank of professional services hours

These benefits match what any enterprise customer might receive, and Avalonia's leadership maintains full discretion on which customer requests become prioritized features.

## Conclusion

This sponsorship is a significant step forward for Avalonia UI’s open-source sustainability and its .NET developer community, aiming to accelerate development and shift focus to free, high-value features while acknowledging the challenges that remain.
