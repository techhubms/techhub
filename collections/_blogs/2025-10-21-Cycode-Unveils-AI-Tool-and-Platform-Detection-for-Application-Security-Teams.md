# Cycode Unveils AI Tool and Platform Detection for Application Security Teams

Cycode has announced early access to enhanced capabilities in its Application Security Posture Management (ASPM) platform, focusing on helping DevSecOps teams manage the increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies in software development.

## Key Features

- **AI Tool and Platform Discovery:** Automatically identifies which AI coding tools and platforms developers use, including tracing the invocation of large language models (LLMs) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
- **AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM):** Extends traditional software bill of materials (SBOM) concepts to cover AI components and underlying technologies in codebases, improving asset traceability and governance.
- **Risk Intelligence Graph (RIG):** Presents a comprehensive inventory of AI and ML assets, proactively detecting the adoption of AI coding assistants, MCP integrations, and AI model usage, with all assets tracked back to source repositories.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Enables DevSecOps teams to define and enforce custom policies ensuring only validated and vetted AI tools and platforms are used, reducing exposure to 'shadow AI.'
- **Security Automation and AI Agents:** Cycode has previously integrated AI agents to evaluate the exploitability of vulnerabilities and offers an AI ROI calculator for DevSecOps teams to assess the value and effectiveness of AI-driven security solutions.

## Importance for DevSecOps

As code generation by AI tools accelerates, visibility and governance become crucial. The Cycode ASPM enhancements help teams:

- Reduce use of unauthorized or unvetted AI tools
- Assess and trace the impact of AI-generated code on application security
- Automate the process of reviewing and validating code generated by both developers and AI agents
- Balance the drive for developer productivity with strong security posture

## Industry Background and Challenges

DevSecOps teams face a growing challenge in policing AI tool adoption across rapidly changing development environments. Most AI coding tools rely on general-purpose LLMs trained on heterogeneous code samples, meaning every generated code segment must be validated before entering production. The pace of AI evolution presents risks as new platforms and assistants enter the market weekly. Cycode’s solution offers enhanced visibility and policy control, addressing this gap.
