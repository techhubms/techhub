# Microsoft Ignite 2024: Key Updates and Insights from the Microsoft Fabric Perspective

**Author:** Samu Niemelä

## Introduction

A year and a half ago, Microsoft introduced Fabric to public preview at Build conference, quickly becoming its flagship for enterprise data solutions and launching the platform as a cornerstone for AI-driven business transformation. After becoming generally available at Ignite 2023, Fabric has seen rapid advancement, releasing over 150 features in a year, though not without some ongoing issues. As Ignite 2024 brings new updates, Samu Niemelä explores the significant changes and freshly announced features that continue to anchor Fabric’s role in AI-centric enterprise data ecosystems.

## Fabric as an AI-Fueled Data Platform

Microsoft continues to position Fabric as an AI-powered data platform. The focus is on enabling data professionals and business users alike to leverage AI and Copilot to work more efficiently and make data-driven decisions. The new messaging around Fabric highlights:

- **AI-powered data platform**
- **Open and AI-ready data lake**
- **AI-enabled business users**
- **Mission-critical foundation**

## Analytical AND Transactional Workloads Together

A notable innovation is the introduction of the Fabric Database class, bringing SQL databases directly into the Fabric environment. This allows analytical and transactional workloads to run in closer proximity, with automatic near real-time data replication to OneLake in delta format. The same SQL endpoint can be used for these workloads, enabling new architectural possibilities by bridging the gap between transactional applications and analytical solutions.

## Real-Time Intelligence Reaches General Availability

Real-Time Intelligence (RTI), first introduced in May 2024, is now generally available. Highlights include:

- **OneLake and job events in Real-Time Hub**: Enables responsive, automated actions based on data changes.
- **CI/CD capabilities**: REST APIs, Git integration, and deployment pipelines simplify collaborative development.
- **OneLake Query Acceleration**: Lakehouse tables can now be queried alongside KQL databases, merging analytical and streaming data more quickly.

These enhancements make it much easier to build responsive real-time data solutions within Fabric.

## OneLake Catalog Streamlines Data Management

Managing complex, large-scale environments is easier with the new **OneLake Catalog**, the next generation of the OneLake data hub. It provides:

- **Explore View:** A unified overview of all workspaces and items, minimizing navigation effort.
- **Govern View:** (Coming soon) Allows data stewardship activities such as managing endorsements, labels, and asset types across distributed environments.

This centralizes asset management and data governance in Fabric.

## Open Mirroring Broadens Integration

Microsoft announced that Azure SQL Database is now generally available as a source for mirroring, with SQL Managed Instance in preview. The broader **Open Mirroring** initiative means any compatible technology can be used for data mirroring with Fabric, lowering the barrier to integrate diverse data solutions.

## Advancements in AI Features

- **AI Skills Capabilities:** Originally available for chatbots working with lakehouse/warehouse data, AI Skills now support KQL databases and semantic models, broadening search and interaction capabilities for users who have existing models.
- **Upcoming AI Functions:** Soon, Fabric will provide native options for AI-driven enrichments (e.g., summarization, sentiment analysis), making it easier for data engineers to derive new insights and serve data consumers more effectively.

## Staying Up-to-date with Fabric

Microsoft continues to innovate aggressively with Fabric, and the platform remains central to the company’s AI and data strategy. Practitioners are encouraged to review the full [Microsoft Ignite 2024 Book of News](https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2024-book-of-news/) for comprehensive coverage.
