# AI: Do or Don’t Believe the Hype – A Balanced Look at AI in DevOps

If you've attended a tech conference, scrolled LinkedIn, or participated in a DevOps Slack lately, you've likely encountered passionate opinions about AI. Is AI the ultimate productivity tool for developers, or just overblown autocomplete? The answer, as Alan Shimel discusses, is nuanced.

## Key Findings from Recent Surveys and Studies

- **Business Optimism:** A GitLab–Harris Poll highlighted that C-level executives believe AI leads to tangible savings ($28,249 per developer per year), a 48% boost in productivity, and revenue growth attributed to software innovations. Boards are also prioritizing software innovation with AI as a fundamental part of future development.
- **Empirical Skepticism:** Contrasting this, the METR study saw 16 experienced open-source devs working on familiar codebases. Using AI tools like Cursor Pro and Claude Sonnet, developers were actually 19% slower – despite reporting perceived speed gains, illustrating the gap between belief and reality.

## Developer and DevOps Anecdotes

- **Positive Experiences:** DevOps, SRE, platform engineering, and QA practitioners cite benefits such as expedited code scaffolding, automated test generation, enriched documentation, and streamlined monitoring rule creation, allowing more focus on complex issues.
- **Cautious Use:** Other developers report slower workflows due to issues like inaccurate AI outputs, hallucinations, or slow responses, opting to use AI tools selectively and with caution.

## Why Opinions Diverge

1. **Perspective Drives Perception:** Executives focus on big-picture ROI, while experienced developers in mature codebases may see negative productivity impacts.
2. **Complexity of Productivity Measurement:** Productivity isn't just about code velocity, but also encompasses code quality, recovery times (MTTR), cognitive load, and innovation rate.
3. **AI Use Case Matters:** The greatest productivity gains with tools like GitHub Copilot show up for newer developers or in simpler tasks. For complex, legacy systems, conventional coding remains better in many scenarios.
4. **Cognitive and Emotional Bias:** Developers often feel more productive with AI, but studies show feelings don't always align with actual speed or quality.
5. **Reliability and Trust:** Incidents like data deletion by Replit or destructive scripts by Google Gemini CLI have shaken trust. Stack Overflow data shows wide intent to use AI tools, but ongoing doubts about their accuracy, security, and ethical implications.

## Conclusion: Rational Optimism

- Executives see AI as essential for future development and innovation strategies.
- Developers working in complex systems must approach AI tools thoughtfully, recognizing that current-generation AI is far from infallible.
- AI's value today is in augmenting, not replacing, skilled practitioners—excelling at scaffolding, documentation, and accelerating select workflows.

Ultimately, as AI technologies and practices mature, developer teams should continually test, measure, and adjust their usage, navigating between hype and hands-on results.
