Mike Vizard summarizes the EMA/Perforce survey findings, exploring how AI coding tools are shifting focus in DevOps workflows, with increased time spent on review and new challenges around security and code quality.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Impact of AI Coding Tools on DevOps Workflows

## Survey Overview

A survey conducted by Enterprise Management Associates (EMA) on behalf of Perforce, polling 206 IT leaders and executives, reveals the significant influence AI coding tools have on modern DevOps workflows.

- **Review > Writing**: 57% of developers are now spending more time on reviewing code, standards, and quality oversight than actual coding.
- **Security & Compliance**: 53% of respondents take on greater security, policy, and compliance responsibilities. Validating AI-generated code is a priority for 52%.
- **Tool Limitations**: Jake Hookom (Perforce) notes teams invest extra effort to address limitations of AI coding tools, such as code verbosity, performance impact, and technical debt.

## Key Findings

- **Security Risks Top Concern**: 62% identify security and privacy as the biggest challenge when using AI tools for coding.
- 52% fear introducing vulnerabilities or code defects.
- Two-thirds worry about reliance on AI tools, with 61% citing “blind faith” in AI-generated results.
- 57% report negative or neutral experiences with inconsistent code quality/testing results from AI tools.

## Organizational Responses

- **Investment Justifications**: AI tool investments are tracked via improvements in code quality, defect reduction (70%), and developer productivity (62%).
- **Developer Perception**: Developer satisfaction (62%), faster time to market (49%), smooth onboarding of junior developers (43%), and better test coverage (56%) are notable positives.
- **Challenges**: Risks include poor/insecure code (54%), integration difficulties (45%), limited architecture/design controls (44%), ownership concerns (33%).

## Adoption and Workflow Implications

- 51% report active use of 'vibe coding tools'; only 3% feel these will fundamentally reshape development workflows.
- Benefits: Productivity enhancement (38%), lower barriers for new/returning developers (33%).
- Areas for improvement: Real-time vulnerability detection (55%), automated test generation (53%), pipeline orchestration (46%), AI-assisted performance testing/environment simulation (46%).

## Blocking AI Coding Tools

- When AI tools are blocked, top reasons are security (45%), intellectual property protection (32%), vendor conflicts (25%).
- Most organizations are supportive or somewhat supportive of using non-approved tools despite concerns.

## Conclusion

While adoption is early, the discussion has shifted from "if" to "to what extent" organizations use AI in software development. The interplay between benefits and risks is driving a re-evaluation of DevOps workflows, with increased emphasis on review, validation, and process adaptation.

## Key Takeaways

- AI coding tools are a double-edged sword: boosting productivity, but raising significant security and workflow challenges.
- Organizations are investing in adaptation, but full process re-engineering remains uncommon.
- Validation, review, and security overlays are vital when deploying AI-powered coding solutions in DevOps pipelines.
