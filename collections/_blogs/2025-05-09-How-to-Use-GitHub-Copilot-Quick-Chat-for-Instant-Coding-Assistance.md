# Quick Chat is your instant AI sidekick

**Posted on May 30, 2025**

GitHub Copilot Quick Chat introduces a streamlined way to interact with GitHub Copilot for fast, focused assistance directly where you code. Whether you're stuck on a function, debugging an error, or improving logic, Quick Chat is your just-in-time AI co-pilot.

## Why Use Quick Chat?

- **Instant, Inline Help:** Get suggestions or explanations for the code under your cursor, without breaking your workflow.
- **Focused Interactions:** Designed for quick questions like code explanation, optimization, or generating unit tests.
- **Stay in Flow:** No need to launch a large chat panel or switch context; everything happens in place.

## How to Use GitHub Copilot Quick Chat

1. **Place your cursor** on the target line of code in your editor.
2. **Open Quick Chat** using the shortcut:
   - `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + L` (Windows/Linux/Mac)
3. **Ask a question** (examples below) in the lightweight inline chat box that appears.
4. **Press Enter** — Copilot will respond in context, right where you are working.

## Example Questions

- "Explain this function"
- "Optimize this code"
- "Add logging to this block"
- "Write a unit test for this"

## Quick Chat vs. Inline Chat

While both offer contextual help, **Quick Chat** is focused on speed and minimal disruption. It works for short bursts of assistance or quick edits, rather than lengthy, ongoing conversations.

## Tips & Pro Tips

- Use Quick Chat whenever you need quick feedback or help, from error explanations to best-practice guidance.
- Combine Quick Chat with standard Copilot suggestions for a powerful coding workflow.

## Summary

GitHub Copilot Quick Chat is designed for developers who value speed and efficiency. With simple keyboard access and focused AI assistance, you can ask questions, optimize code, and resolve issues without ever leaving your code editor.
