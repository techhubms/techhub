# Branding Your SharePoint Site for Your Organization

Branding your SharePoint site goes far beyond simple color changes—it's about creating a unified, engaging digital workspace that reflects your company’s identity and encourages user engagement.

## Why Branding Matters in SharePoint

- **Reinforces Company Culture:** A consistent look and feel fosters a sense of belonging among employees.
- **Boosts Adoption:** Professionally branded sites encourage regular use and engagement.
- **Improves Navigation:** Custom branding can improve site usability and highlight important resources.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Customizing Your SharePoint Site

### 1. Add Your Company Logo and Site Name

- Navigate to your SharePoint site.
- Click the **Settings (gear icon)** and select **Change the look** > **Header**.
- Upload your organization's logo (preferably a transparent PNG) and assign a clear site name.

### 2. Apply a Custom Theme

- Select **Change the look** > **Theme** in Settings.
- Either choose a default theme or customize your own by applying your brand's primary and secondary colors.
- Admins can create custom themes in the SharePoint Admin Center for organization-wide consistency.

### 3. Customize Site Header and Footer

- Adjust header layout (Compact, Standard, Extended), background colors, and display the site logo.
- Add important quick links and company info in the footer for easy access to resources like HR or IT.

### 4. Design the Homepage Layout

- Edit the homepage and add sections with 1–3 columns as needed.
- Utilize Web Parts:
  - **Hero Web Part:** Highlight key announcements or resources.
  - **Quick Links:** Direct users to essential apps and portals.
  - **News/Event Web Parts:** Keep everyone up to date.
- Republish to save your changes.

### 5. Use Images and Banners

- Use high-quality, authentic images to showcase company culture.
- Customize banners with the Hero Web Part to promote key initiatives.
- Maintain consistency in icons and graphics for a professional look.

### 6. Apply Site Templates

- Go to **Settings** > **Apply a site template** to ensure design consistency across teams or departments.

### 7. Test for Accessibility

- Check color contrast and font sizes for readability across devices.
- Make sure all links and buttons are easily navigable and accessible.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Simple:** Avoid clutter for a cleaner user experience.
- **Be Consistent:** Standardize colors, fonts, and layout across the intranet.
- **Use Hub Sites:** Connect related sites for a seamless experience.
- **Gather Feedback:** Solicit input from users and iterate improvements.

Branding your SharePoint site is an ongoing process that builds user trust and boosts productivity, transforming your environment into a powerful digital hub tailored to your organization’s needs. Start with logos and themes and expand as your digital workplace grows.
