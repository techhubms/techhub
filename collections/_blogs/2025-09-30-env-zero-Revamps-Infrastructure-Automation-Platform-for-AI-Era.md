# env zero Revamps Infrastructure Automation Platform for AI Era

*By Mike Vizard*

## Introduction

Env zero (formerly env0) has significantly upgraded its Cloud Governance Platform, embedding artificial intelligence (AI) and support for the emerging Model Context Protocol (MCP). These enhancements are designed to streamline infrastructure automation and governance for DevOps teams in the age of AI.

## Key Features and Enhancements

- **AI Capabilities**: The platform now includes AI-driven functionality, such as a Static Code Analyzer Agent, launching soon, which helps identify and resolve code issues within infrastructure-as-code (IaC) deployments.
- **MCP Server Integration**: Integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging standard originally developed by Anthropic for exposing data to AI applications and agents.
- **Improved Automation and Governance**: Offers a control plane that automates and governs IaC across public cloud resources, connecting repositories and cloud platforms more efficiently.
- **Single-Click Remediation**: The Static Code Analyzer can generate pull requests for remediation, streamlining enforcement of compliance, data protection, and security measures.
- **Tool Compatibility**: Compatible with leading IaC tools including Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi, CloudFormation, Terragrunt, and Kubernetes, enabling automated, policy-driven infrastructure provisioning.

## Implications for DevOps Teams

- **AI Agent Enablement**: DevOps teams can leverage AI agents to automate cloud infrastructure provisioning, with guardrails enforced via policies as code.
- **Reduced Complexity**: AI agents, powered by MCP servers, reduce the need for custom scripts and APIs, simplifying DevOps workflows.
- **Governance and Compliance**: With stronger compliance controls and security features, teams can avoid inadvertent data exposure or compliance violations.
- **Recommendations**: While AI agents improve workflow efficiency, teams are encouraged to review AI-produced infrastructure changes and identify further automation opportunities to minimize manual toil and bottlenecks.

## Considerations

- Organizations should carefully assess their reliance on AI agents, ensuring appropriate oversight and compliance controls.
- Adoption of new standards like MCP and the integration of AI suggests an industry trend towards intelligent, automated infrastructure governance.
