# Technical Debt: Make Developers Happier Now or Pay More Later

By Ernesto Tagwerker

## Introduction

Technical debt is a significant challenge for organizations, consuming on average 30% of IT budgets and stifling innovation, according to a Protiviti survey of over a thousand tech executives. Nearly 70% of respondents felt technical debt highly impacted their organization's ability to innovate and deliver value.

## The True Cost and Cause of Technical Debt

Technical debt arises not from developers themselves, but often from non-technical leadership prioritizing product roadmaps over sustainable engineering practices. This can lead to a poor developer experience (DX), decreased productivity, and a toxic work culture. The article emphasizes the need to actively improve developers’ work environments, including providing access to advanced AI tools and resources that support both the developer and organizational growth.

## The Role of a DX Champion

A DX champion is a senior engineer dedicated to monitoring and improving the experience of developers, especially new hires. They:

- Track onboarding times and assist new developers in creating effective environments.
- Investigate process bottlenecks, such as slow continuous integration (CI) services or unreliable test suites.
- Recommend improvements and halt unproductive activities to keep code clean and maintainable.
- Utilize tools (including CI platforms) to flag and address flaky tests or inefficient processes.

## Measuring and Managing Developer Morale

Regular team surveys and attention to metrics like “time to fix” help DX champions monitor developer happiness, productivity, and turnover. Identifying slow patch deployment or recurring issues helps managers address root problems and ensure developers have the technologies they need.

## AI Agents and the Future of Development

AI tooling is increasingly part of the modern engineering landscape. AI agents support automation, streamline bug-fixing, and allow developers to focus on higher-value work. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2028, a third of enterprise applications will include AI agents, indicating large-scale adoption. Human oversight remains essential to ensure AI augments rather than replaces critical engineering decisions.

## Practices to Reduce Technical Debt

- Invest consistent time in strengthening the developer experience.
- Appoint a DX champion to advocate for process and tooling improvements.
- Implement transparent communication about acceptable technical debt and code quality standards.
- Adopt automation and AI agents thoughtfully, balancing efficiency with human judgement.
- Foster organizational cultures that value developers’ well-being and professional growth to avoid escalating technical debt and its long-term costs.

## Conclusion

Reducing technical debt isn’t just a technical challenge but a cultural and leadership imperative. By prioritizing developer experience, leveraging automation and AI, and making continuous improvements part of the organizational DNA, companies can ensure happier, more productive engineering teams and remain competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape.
