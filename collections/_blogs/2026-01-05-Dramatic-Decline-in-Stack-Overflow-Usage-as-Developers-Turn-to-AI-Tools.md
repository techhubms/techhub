# Dramatic Decline in Stack Overflow Usage as Developers Turn to AI Tools

Stack Overflow, once the primary hub for developers needing help, has witnessed a staggering 78% drop in question volume year-over-year, shrinking to just 3,862 questions in December 2025—down from over 200,000 per month at its 2014 peak.

## Why the Drop?

- **Rise of AI Coding Assistants:** Developers are increasingly turning to AI tools integrated directly into their IDEs. These tools provide instant answers, reducing the need to post forum questions.
- **Moderator Sentiment:** Stories of users experiencing harsh moderation on Stack Overflow have contributed to the reluctance to post.
- **Changing Community Priorities:** Stack Overflow's shift toward high-quality, curated answers over volume may have alienated some users.
- **Centralized Web Ecosystems:** With Google and other platforms attempting to keep users within their own environments, forums see less external traffic.
- **AI vs. Community Wisdom:** While AI provides fast answers, some developers worry about the loss of reasoned debate and expert discussion once central to Stack Overflow.

## Broader Impacts

- **Data Quality Concerns:** Analytics tools like the Redmonk Language ranking depend on Stack Overflow data, and declining volumes may reduce accuracy.
- **Business Model:** Despite less traffic, Stack Overflow's revenue still grew by 12% in the reported half-year, mainly on the strength of its paid business products.
- **AI Policy Conflicts:** Stack Overflow recently launched AI Assist, an AI-driven help tool, but continues to ban generative AI answers on its public forums, creating controversy and confusion.
- **Competition:** The rise of similar AI help tools from Google, AWS, and Microsoft/GitHub means Stack Overflow faces pressure from major tech vendors.

## Industry Reactions

- **Expert Opinions:** Some developers express concern about the sustainability of high-quality knowledge sources if interaction shifts away from open forums.
- **Alternative Metrics:** Stack Overflow stakeholders debate if question volume is still the right measurement for platform health.
