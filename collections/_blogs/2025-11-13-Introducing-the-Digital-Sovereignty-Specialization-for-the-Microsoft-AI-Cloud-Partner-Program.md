# Introducing the Digital Sovereignty Specialization for the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program

**By Thomas Maurer**

Microsoft has launched the Digital Sovereignty Specialization under the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program—a new opportunity for partners to showcase expertise in deploying sovereign, compliant, and trusted cloud solutions built on the Microsoft Cloud and Azure.

## What is the Digital Sovereignty Specialization?

This specialization enables Microsoft partners to validate their capabilities in helping customers meet strict data residency, sovereignty, and compliance requirements. It supports organizations in regulated and public sector markets, leveraging Microsoft innovations in scalability, security, and compliance.

## Alignment with Microsoft Sovereign Cloud

The Digital Sovereignty Specialization is closely tied to Microsoft’s Sovereign Cloud strategy. It allows governments, public sector organizations, and regulated industries to maintain control over their data and operations via:

- **Sovereign Public Cloud** regions
- **Sovereign Private Cloud** deployments

Partners with this specialization are positioned to deliver technical, operational, and compliance outcomes in line with Microsoft's cloud standards and practices.

## How Partners Qualify

To achieve the specialization, partners must:

- Meet audit and competency requirements
- Showcase customer success stories
- Align with Microsoft Cloud Partner Program designations

Resources are available to guide partners:

## Benefits for Partners and Customers

- **Partners:**
  - Demonstrate deep skill in digital sovereignty and compliance
  - Build trust with customers in regulated verticals
  - Expand opportunities within Microsoft Sovereign Cloud ecosystems
  - Stand out in the partner ecosystem for security, compliance, and transparency

- **Customers:**
  - Gain confidence in partners capable of navigating complex regulatory environments
  - Adopt AI and cloud innovation without sacrificing data control
  - Collaborate with trusted expert teams for sovereign deployments

## Empowering Trust in the AI Era

As organizations move to integrate AI and cloud, trust, transparency, and sovereignty become crucial. This specialization is part of Microsoft’s effort to support responsible and secure AI adoption, particularly for those needing to adhere to local data and compliance requirements.
