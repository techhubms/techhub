# Save on Azure SQL with Azure Hybrid Benefit

**Author: Thomas Maurer**

In an episode of the Azure Essentials Show, Thomas Maurer is joined by Debbie Lyons to discuss the significant advantages of using Azure SQL and how enterprises can save costs with Azure Hybrid Benefit. The session highlights ways Azure SQL, as a fully managed, secure, and intelligent family of SQL database services, supports different stages of cloud adoption and streamlines data management.

## Key Topics Covered

### Overview of Azure SQL

- Azure SQL encompasses a range of services, including:
  - SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
  - Azure SQL Managed Instance
  - Azure SQL Database
- These services enable organizations to choose the best fit for their workload, regardless of cloud adoption stage.
- The platform offers high security, intelligent automation, and cost optimization features.

### Azure Hybrid Benefit

- **Azure Hybrid Benefit** is an Azure offering designed to reduce expenses during cloud migrations.
- It provides substantial discounts on Azure SQL and Windows licenses, as well as Linux subscriptions.
- The benefit supports infrastructure modernization and encourages a cloud-first strategy.

#### Coverage and Scope

- Available for use with:
  - Azure VMware Solution
  - Nutanix
  - Windows Server (with Software Assurance or Subscription)
  - RedHat and SUSE Linux subscriptions

### Azure Hybrid Benefit for Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance

- Enables organizations to use existing SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance to get discounted rates for:
  - Azure SQL Database
  - Azure SQL Managed Instance
- Savings can reach up to **30% or more** compared to standard pricing.
- A [calculator tool](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/#features) is available to estimate potential savings.
- With Azure Hybrid Benefit, you only pay for the underlying Azure infrastructure if you bring your own SQL Server license (Base Compute pricing).
- Without Azure Hybrid Benefit, charges include both infrastructure and a new SQL Server license (License-Included pricing).

### Security and Performance Enhancements

- Azure SQL offers built-in security features to protect data.
- An upcoming architectural upgrade to the general-purpose service tier for SQL Managed Instance was previewed, promising better performance at no additional cost.

### Practical Implications

- **Cost Reductions:** Organizations can realize significant cost savings (up to 55% in some scenarios) by leveraging existing licenses.
- **Migration Flexibility:** The benefit applies to various cloud migration strategies, supporting both lift-and-shift and modernization approaches.
- **Data Management:** Fully managed services reduce operational complexity and improve scalability.
