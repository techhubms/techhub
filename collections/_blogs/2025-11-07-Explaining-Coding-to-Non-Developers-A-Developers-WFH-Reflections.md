# What are you doing? – How I Tried to Explain Coding to Normal People

**Author: Wouter Vercruysse**

Working remotely has changed not just how developers work, but also shed light on how challenging it can be to explain software development to people outside of tech. Wouter Vercruysse shares his real-world experiences in trying to unpack 'what developers do' for friends, family, and anyone who asks the inevitable question: "What exactly are you doing?"

## Context and Motivation

As remote work increased, Wouter found that colleagues weren’t the only ones curious about his screen filled with code—family and friends started asking more questions too. Instead of focusing on business or functional outcomes, he tried to describe the literal day-to-day actions: writing code, compiling, debugging, deploying applications.

## The Everyday Developer Workflow

Wouter describes his workflow:

- Opening Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio
- Building web applications
- Writing functions that render HTML, updating databases, and triggering backend events
- Fixing alignment issues or troubleshooting obscure build errors

He candidly shares that detailed technical explanations often lead to blank stares from non-tech people, humorously comparing it to people's reaction to finance or fashion talk.

## DevOps Rituals: From YAML Pipelines to Bicep Deployments

The post highlights common artifacts of the developer experience:

- Working with **YAML pipelines** for continuous integration and deployment
- Troubleshooting failures in **Bicep deployments** on Azure
- Struggling through misleading or inaccurate build errors
- Experiencing the small victories (and frustrations) of debugging and getting things right

These are illustrated with relatable memes and images, bringing humor and authenticity to the development journey.

## The “Flicker” and Why Developers Do This

Wouter refers to the 'flicker'—that almost superstitious hope that this build or deployment will be the one that works. After repeated failures (like an Azure DevOps pipeline finally succeeding), achieving one successful run is euphoric. He emphasizes that, beyond personal satisfaction, there’s also a strong sense of teamwork and shared accomplishment in development teams.

## Conclusion: Communication Challenges

When trying to explain the entire process to non-technical people, Wouter admits that most of the time, the answer boils down to, “So… money?” with a laugh. He also describes his focus on optimizing codebases and teamwork at Zure, where these little victories are not just personal but collective.
