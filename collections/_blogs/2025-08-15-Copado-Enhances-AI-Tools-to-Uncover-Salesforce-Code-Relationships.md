# Copado Enhances AI Tools to Uncover Salesforce Code Relationships

**By Mike Vizard**

Copado has expanded its artificial intelligence (AI) features within its DevOps platform for Salesforce development. The newly introduced Org Intelligence module leverages Salesforce metadata to identify and map relationships between objects and code, drastically reducing the time needed for discovery—potentially by up to 80%.

**Key Features:**

- **Metadata Analysis:** The Org Intelligence module examines Salesforce’s proprietary metadata to uncover how application objects and code are related, which has long been a challenge in complex Salesforce environments.
- **Impact Analysis:** Developers and admins can now perform thorough change impact analyses, making it easier to anticipate how changes ripple through applications.
- **Object Reuse:** By surfacing already-created objects, teams can avoid unnecessary duplication, fostering better reuse and consistency.
- **DevOps Best Practices:** The module is designed to help both professional and citizen developers adhere to established DevOps workflows—even in organizations where formal engineering experience may be limited.
- **Incident Response:** Improved insight and visibility accelerate DevOps teams’ ability to respond to issues or incidents.

Copado’s AI capabilities aim to address the increasing pace of Salesforce development as low-code and AI-driven workflows gain traction. Acceleration makes it crucial for teams to focus not just on how much code is written, but also on application design and maintainability, particularly where admin-level creators may lack advanced software engineering skills.

Gloria Ramchandani, Copado’s SVP of Product, highlights how enhanced relationship discovery and impact analysis can reduce developer stress and improve the reliability and security of deployed Salesforce applications.

> "With this AI integration, organizations can more reliably scale, reuse, and secure their Salesforce applications, all while adhering to best DevOps practices."
