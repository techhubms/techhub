Mike Vizard introduces Spacelift Intent, an AI-driven, open source framework that lets DevOps teams provision infrastructure using natural language, eliminating the need to manually write Terraform or OpenTofu code.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Spacelift Unveils Open Source AI Vibecoding Tool for Infrastructure Provisioning

**Author:** Mike Vizard

## Overview

Spacelift has announced 'Spacelift Intent,' an open source, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to let IT teams provision infrastructure without needing to create or maintain Terraform or OpenTofu code. Instead of generating code, Spacelift Intent understands natural language requests and interacts directly with infrastructure APIs via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard developed by Anthropic.

## Key Features

- **Codeless Infrastructure Provisioning:** Users can describe infrastructure tasks in plain English, which the AI translates into API calls, bypassing the need for HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or traditional coding.
- **Integration with LLMs:** Spacelift Intent leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret user requests and manage resource provisioning tasks.
- **Use Cases:** Best suited for non-mission-critical scenarios, like creating databases or test environments, where the rigor of full code reviews is unnecessary.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Mission-critical infrastructure should still use hand-written, tested IaC. Spacelift Intent is positioned for situations needing speed and lower overhead.
- **Early Access:** The AI tool is also available in the commercial Spacelift Infrastructure Orchestration Platform, which includes policy management and auditing capabilities.

## Industry Context

- **AI in DevOps:** The article highlights a growing trend—DevOps teams using AI tools to reduce repetitive work and accelerate software delivery. While generative AI can introduce risk (e.g., accidentally producing non-optimal or insecure code), strategic application in low-risk use cases can improve productivity.
- **Risk and Adoption:** Organizations must define clear boundaries for AI use in development, balancing speed with security and reliability. The flexibility of Spacelift Intent helps teams offload non-critical toil without jeopardizing production workloads.
- **Automation Benefits:** Removing bottlenecks from infrastructure provisioning can help alleviate developer burnout and support organizations in scaling software delivery efficiently.

## Quotes

> "The overall goal is to use AI to reduce toil where the level of potential risk is relatively minimal." — Marcin Wyszynski, Spacelift

> “DevOps workflows become less tedious to manage as AI takes on repetitive infrastructure tasks.”

## Additional Information

- **Technology:** Spacelift Intent utilizes natural language processing, LLM interfaces, and direct API manipulation through MCP.
- **Commercial Platform:** Early-access integration with Spacelift’s orchestration and policy engine adds state management and auditing.
- **AI Limitations:** Generative AI is probabilistic and may not always produce optimal code; use is encouraged primarily where mistakes are low impact.
