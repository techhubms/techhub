# Pulumi Introduces AI Agents for Automated Infrastructure Management

**Author:** Mike Vizard

Pulumi has unveiled 'Pulumi Neo', a set of artificial intelligence (AI) agents available in preview, aimed at automating a range of infrastructure management tasks on their infrastructure-as-code (IaC) platform. The new AI agents are built to assist with diagnosing issues, executing and monitoring changes, and maintaining compliance—a digital extension to the platform engineering and DevOps team.

## What Pulumi Neo Offers

- **Automated Diagnosis and Task Execution:** The AI agents are capable of autonomously identifying infrastructure problems and resolving them when authorized.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Pulumi Neo observes dependencies, executes approved changes, tracks outcomes, and enforces policy compliance across the infrastructure lifecycle.
- **Compliance and Audit:** With comprehensive tracking and historic workflows, teams can satisfy compliance needs by seeing which tasks have been automated.
- **Interactive Guidance:** AI guidance is available, with approvals and policy checks built-in to every step of the process.
- **Customizable Degree of Automation:** Teams can opt for suggestions only, or delegate full automation to the agents, depending on risk appetite and permissions.

## Integration, Architecture, and Use Cases

- **Platform Analysis:** Neo analyzes underlying platforms and may recommend migrations, such as moving workloads from Kubernetes to simpler cloud environments like Amazon ECS.
- **Agentic Workflows:** By linking to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, Neo can be invoked by AI coding tools to enable agent-driven workflows that match best DevOps practices.
- **Early Success Stories:** Companies like Werner Enterprises have already reported reducing infrastructure provisioning times from days to hours while keeping compliance and accelerating releases.

## Considerations and Outlook

- **Risk and Control:** Automation brings efficiency but also requires robust controls; all automated actions are revertible to preserve reliability.
- **DevSecOps Concerns:** While AI and IaC can cut down toil and reduce misconfiguration risks, teams must remain vigilant for security exposures or improper automation outputs.
- **Adoption Trajectory:** The article notes that wide adoption may take time as organizations build trust in agent-driven automation, but the need is rising with workload growth.
