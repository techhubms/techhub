# Copilot vs. Chat: Sidekick Showdown

*Posted on Jul 11, 2025 by Randy Pagels*

When you're seeking coding help, should you rely on GitHub Copilot's inline suggestions, or turn to chatbots like Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, or Gemini? This article explores the strengths of each tool and suggests practical ways to use both in your daily development workflow.

## GitHub Copilot (Inline)

- Provides real-time code suggestions as you type inside your editor
- Works in context, requiring little input—ideal for generating boilerplate, fixing bugs, and speeding up routine coding tasks
- Lets you “just get this done” without switching context

## Chatbots (Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, Gemini)

- Designed for back-and-forth conversations
- Great for getting explanations, alternative implementations, test plans, and architecture ideas
- Useful for debugging (“Explain this bug”), refactoring (“Rewrite this method 3 ways”), or learning new APIs
- You describe your problem, paste code, or ask open-ended questions

## When to Use Each?

- **Use Copilot inline** for quick, context-aware code suggestions and everyday tasks
- **Use Chat** when you need detailed explanations, want to brainstorm, or ask broader coding questions

## Pro Tip: Use Both Together

A balanced workflow might look like this:

1. Use Copilot inline to get suggestions as you build
2. If blocked, ask a chatbot for deeper help, explanations, or architecture advice
3. Share tricky code or errors with chatbots for review
4. Bring chatbot suggestions back into your editor for testing and iteration

## Takeaway

GitHub Copilot is a fast-acting coding assistant for routine tasks. Chatbots offer conversational support, helping with complex problem solving, learning, and creativity. By combining them, developers can improve both speed and depth in daily coding.
