# CodeRabbit Adds CLI and AI-Powered Enhancements to Code Review Platform

**Author:** Mike Vizard  

CodeRabbit has announced major feature updates for its AI-driven code review platform:

- **CLI Support:** Developers can now leverage CodeRabbit directly from the command line, alongside existing IDE integrations, enabling workflow flexibility regardless of developer tool preference.
- **Automatic Unit Test Generation:** The platform can now generate unit tests automatically, improving test coverage and helping teams maintain code reliability.
- **Custom Pre-Merge Checks:** Organizations can configure pre-merge checks to ensure code meets quality and policy requirements before being integrated.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Client:** Integration with MCP allows CodeRabbit to fetch requirements and engineering documentation from external sources, providing additional context for code review.

## How CodeRabbit Works

- CodeRabbit integrates with Git-based repositories, reviewing code with every commit via AI and code graph analysis.
- The AI platform surfaces routine coding issues, allowing human reviewers to focus on more complex or context-specific feedback.
- A natural language chat interface facilitates code review and code improvement conversations.

## Addressing AI-Created Code Quality

- With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in code generation, CodeRabbit provides specialized AI models and analysis to help catch flaws that may be introduced by general LLMs.
- Code graph analysis and AST-based pattern matching enable the platform to summarize codebases and detect cross-file dependencies or organization-specific coding practices.

## Additional Highlights

- CodeRabbit now serves over 8,000 customers, including Chegg, Groupon, Life360, and Mercury.
- Maintainers of more than 100,000 open source projects can access a free edition.
- The company has recently secured $60 million in additional funding, underscoring its momentum in AI-enabled DevOps tooling.

## Why This Matters

The exponential growth of AI-generated code introduces new quality and security risks. Tools like CodeRabbit are taking an increasingly central role in DevOps workflows, ensuring code is reliable, secure, and meets organizational standards before going live.
