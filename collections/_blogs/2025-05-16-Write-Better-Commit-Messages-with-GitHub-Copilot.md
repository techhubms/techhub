# Write Better Commit Messages with GitHub Copilot

A good commit message helps convey the intent of your code changes, and with GitHub Copilot, this task becomes even easier. This guide breaks down how to use Copilot to write clear, concise commit messages, saving you time and helping your team.

## Let Copilot Suggest Commit Messages Based on Code Changes

Rather than spending extra time composing commit logs, let Copilot review your diffs and generate summaries tailored to your workflow. Copilot supports different styles, like conventional commits or concise past-tense notes.

### Practical Ways to Use Copilot for Commits

**1. In Copilot Chat:**

- Ask Copilot directly: `# Suggest a commit message based on my staged changes`
- Copilot will read the context and provide a professional summary.

**2. In the Commit Message Field (VS Code):**

- Type a prompt, e.g.:
  `// Suggest a concise commit message for the updated login form validation`
- Trigger Copilot's suggestion (often with the Tab key) to autocomplete your message.

**3. For Pull Request (PR) Titles and Descriptions:**

- Use prompts like:
  `# Summarize this pull request in a clear, professional message`
- Copilot can help create summaries that reflect the changes accurately.

### Extra Prompts to Try

- `# Write a commit message using the Conventional Commits format`
- `# Generate a descriptive commit message for a refactor`
- `# Create a commit message that mentions the related issue #245`

## Quick Takeaway

Well-written commits benefit everyone involved in a project. GitHub Copilot helps you keep your commit history clean and your documentation useful, allowing you to focus more on coding.
