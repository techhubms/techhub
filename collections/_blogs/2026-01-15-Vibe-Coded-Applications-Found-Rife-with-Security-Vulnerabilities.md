DevClass.com analyzes security flaws in applications generated by AI coding agents, as reported by researcher Ori David. The article highlights common vulnerabilities in 'vibe-coded' apps—where AI handles most programming—and discusses why manual code review remains critical.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Vibe-Coded Applications Found Rife with Security Vulnerabilities

*Published by DevClass.com on January 15, 2026*

## Overview

The concept of "vibe coding"—delegating almost all application logic to AI code generation agents—has gained traction among both technical and non-technical users. However, a recent evaluation by Ori David, a researcher at security start-up Tenzai, has revealed that applications developed through this approach are commonly full of severe security blunders.

## Research Findings

David created three different applications with the same set of detailed prompts, using five prominent AI coding agents: Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Replit, and Devin. Testing their outputs, he discovered numerous vulnerabilities in all, with Claude, Devin, and Codex generating especially critical flaws.

### Example: Authorization Flaw

One highlighted example is a PHP snippet generated by Claude Code for an ecommerce site:

```php
// If authenticated, enforce ownership check
if ($user) {
  // Admin can delete any product, seller can only delete own
  if ($user['role'] !== 'admin' && $product['seller_id'] != $user['id']) {
    sendJsonResponse(['error' => 'Failed to delete', 'code' => 'FORBIDDEN'], 403);
  }
}

// Delete the product
$stmt = $db->prepare("DELETE FROM products WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$id]);
```

If the user is not logged in, the code executes a product deletion with no ownership check—leaving a simple exploitation path for unauthorized users. Similar logic lapses appeared across multiple agents.

## Observations and Common Issues

- **Authorization and Business Logic:** AI agents handled classic attack vectors like SQL injection and XSS relatively well, but often failed with authorization and custom business logic. Notably, agents let users order negative quantities or create products with negative prices.
- **Omitted Best Practices:** Security controls like enforcing security headers or preventing server-side request forgery (SSRF) were sometimes missing.
- **Skill Level of Users:** The ease of vibe coding lets less proficient developers ship functional but unsafe software. Experienced developers may spot flaws, but non-technical users likely will not.

## Remediation and Limitations

While new AI security agents (such as Tenzai's) aim to find these vulnerabilities, the effectiveness of “AI reviewing AI” is not fully proven. The research underscores that robust human code review remains vital, as AI-generated code can conceal subtle and severe flaws.

## Risk Assessment

With increasing pressure for quick releases and fewer manual checks, vibe coding is likely to make secure software even harder to achieve. The report warns against relying exclusively on automated agents and urges practitioners to maintain rigorous review processes.
