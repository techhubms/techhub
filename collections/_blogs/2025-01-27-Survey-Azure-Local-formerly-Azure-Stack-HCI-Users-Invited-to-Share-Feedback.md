- **Incentive:** Participants will be entered into a drawing to win one of three $250 USD virtual gift cards.

### Key Technologies

- **AKS Arc:** Azure Kubernetes Service enabled by Azure Arc, allowing customers to run managed Kubernetes clusters in diverse environments, including on-premises with Azure Local.

### Participation

- **No prior Kubernetes experience required:** The survey is designed for a broad range of users, from those new to Kubernetes to experienced operators.
- **Feedback focus:** Questions will likely cover both usability and technical aspects of AKS Arc on Azure Local.

### Call to Action

Thomas Maurer encourages all eligible users to take 10 minutes to complete the survey and help shape the product's future direction.
