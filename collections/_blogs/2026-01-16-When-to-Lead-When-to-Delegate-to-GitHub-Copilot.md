# When to Lead, When to Delegate to GitHub Copilot

*By Randy Pagels*

Knowing how and when to collaborate with AI tools is essential for modern software development. This post offers practical guidance for working alongside GitHub Copilot.

## Key Principles

- **GitHub Copilot should be treated as a teammate, not an autopilot.**
- Developers maintain control over judgment, design, and goal-setting.
- Copilot excels in executing repetitive or well-defined tasks.

## When You Should Lead

Take charge in areas that require expertise, critical thinking, or context:

- Designing system architecture or data flow
- Making decisions about security, performance, or cost
- Interpreting ambiguous requirements or business rules
- Reviewing logic that impacts users or production data

**Practical prompt for Copilot Chat:**

```
I want to design this part myself. Ask me clarifying questions before suggesting any code.
```

## When to Delegate to Copilot

Let Copilot assist with:

- Writing boilerplate or repetitive code
- Translating logic between languages or frameworks
- Writing or refactoring tests
- Refactoring for readability or consistency
- Adding logging, validation, or comments

**Delegation prompt example:**

```
Take this existing code and refactor it for clarity and consistency. Do not change behavior.
```

## A Feedback Loop Approach

Strengthen the relationship with Copilot through an iterative workflow:

1. Explain your overall goal clearly.
2. Ask Copilot for an initial solution.
3. Review and provide feedback.
4. Request updates or adjustments as needed.

**Sample follow-up prompt:**

```
Good start. Now simplify this logic and explain any assumptions you made.
```

## Rule of Thumb

- Lead if the task requires judgment, creativity, or context.
- Delegate if the task is primarily execution or routine typing.
- Maintain responsibility for overall intent and quality.

## Takeaway

By combining human insight with Copilot’s automation capabilities, developers can achieve faster, higher-quality results. Use Copilot for efficiency, but lead with expertise where it matters.
