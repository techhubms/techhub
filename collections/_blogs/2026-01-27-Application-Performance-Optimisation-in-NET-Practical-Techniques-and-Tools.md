# Application Performance Optimisation in .NET: Practical Techniques and Tools

**By Steve Gordon**

## Overview

Application performance is always important, impacting user experience and resource efficiency. In this talk, Steve Gordon explores practical approaches to performance optimisation in .NET, ensuring that developers don’t fall into the trap of undertaking premature optimisation or, conversely, ignoring performance issues until they become serious.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Performance Lifecycle**: Understanding the importance of monitoring applications in production and determining when and where to focus optimisation efforts.
- **Profiling and Benchmarking**: Using tools like dotTrace, dotMemory, and BenchmarkDotNet for analysing bottlenecks and validating improvements.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Walking through a practical example, Steve demonstrates the full optimisation cycle: profiling, designing benchmarks, theorising improvements, and refining implementation to reduce allocations and execution time.
- **Memory and Code Efficiency**: Discussion of common optimisation areas including memory usage, allocation reduction, and more efficient execution flows.
- **Judgment in Optimisation**: Balancing performance gains with maintainability, readability, and engineering resources.

## Practical Example

Through a real-world feature, the post illustrates:

- Profiling the application
- Designing and running benchmarks
- Theory-crafting and discussing bottlenecks
- Making incremental changes to code and measuring the impact
- Evaluating the trade-offs between readability and performance

## Tools Highlighted

- **dotTrace**: For code profiling and identifying performance hot-spots.
- **dotMemory**: For tracking memory usage and finding allocation-heavy sections.
- **BenchmarkDotNet**: For reliable, repeatable benchmarking of .NET code changes.
