Mike Vizard presents findings from a survey showing that AI code generation is speeding up development but also introducing new DevOps challenges, from downstream incidents to security concerns.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Survey Surfaces Downstream DevOps Challenges Created by AI Code

**Author:** Mike Vizard

A recent survey of 900 engineers, platform leaders, and technical managers conducted by Coleman Parkes (on behalf of Harness) highlights dramatic shifts brought on by AI adoption in software development:

## Key Findings

- **Faster Code Shipping:** 63% report faster code delivery after introducing AI into development workflows.
- **Increased Downstream Issues:** 72% of organizations have suffered at least one production incident tied to AI-generated code. 45% find deployments involving AI-generated code problematic.
- **Automation Gaps:** Only 6% have fully automated their continuous delivery process. 83% believe AI must cover the entire SDLC for full potential.
- **AI Coding Risks:** 63% worry that "vibe coding" with AI agents creates overwhelming rework for DevOps teams, as code may be flawed or contextually inadequate. 73% fear that unmanaged AI assistants could dramatically expand the impact of failed releases.
- **Security Concerns:** 48% expect AI to increase software vulnerabilities; only 41% trust their governance tools to catch issues pre-release.
- **Cost Risks:** 70% fear that inefficient AI-generated code in production will trigger cost overruns.

## Expert Commentary

Trevor Stuart, SVP and GM of Harness, notes that much AI-generated code is "sent back to the kitchen" for extensive rework. DevOps teams now face a mismatch: AI helps developers write more code, but existing pipelines – described as "a two-lane bridge" – often can't keep pace.

Modernization and rationalization of DevOps pipelines are now necessary, with an emphasis on using AI not just in coding, but also for managing and orchestrating pipeline workflows themselves. However, context switching among 8, 10, or more AI tools (as 71% of respondents do) drains productivity.

## Implications for DevOps Teams

- Increasing AI tool usage requires improved integration and standardization.
- There is a strong need for better pipeline automation and governance.
- Teams must address new security and cost challenges emerging from AI-generated code.
- Organizations failing to integrate AI safely and efficiently risk falling behind rapidly.
