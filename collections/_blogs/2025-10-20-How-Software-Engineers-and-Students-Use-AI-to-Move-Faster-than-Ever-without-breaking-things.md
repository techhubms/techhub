# How Software Engineers and Students Use AI to Move Faster than Ever (without breaking things)

**Author:** Vivek Vaidya

## Overview

This article explores the rapid transformation happening within software development and education due to artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the rise of agentic coding tools. Focusing on developers and students, it describes how AI tools allow for automation of repetitive work, foster higher productivity, and support more focused collaboration and creativity in both the workplace and classroom.

## Agentic AI Transforms Developer Workflows

- AI tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) can dramatically expand the capabilities of individual engineers.
- Background agents automate boilerplate code, documentation, test generation, and legacy code review, with the capacity to process extensive codebases (up to a million tokens or 30-40k lines).
- These tools free engineers from monotonous work, allowing focus on architectural design and other challenging tasks that require creativity and critical thinking.
- Collaboration patterns change as engineers use AI to clarify, document, and expedite tasks, spending meeting time on strategic topics instead of routine coordination.

## The Role of Human Skills in the AI Era

- While AI excels at task execution and code generation, it’s limited in creativity, solution architecture, and unstructured problem-solving.
- Human engineers are now freed to work on big-picture issues and innovative solutions, leveraging AI for routine work but retaining essential technical judgment and organizational abilities.

## AI-Native Education: Opportunities and Pitfalls

- Today’s students have access to the same AI tools as professional developers.
- Properly integrating AI into education helps learners build relevant, modern skills rather than relying on outdated methods.
- There are risks: overuse of AI in learning may mean students aren’t building deeper technical skills; underuse may leave them ill-prepared for a modern workforce.
- Colleges and universities should strategically incorporate AI into curricula, balancing tool usage with an emphasis on problem understanding and manual reasoning.

## Future Outlook and Workforce Adaptation

- The pace of innovation in agentic AI tools and large language models (LLMs) is accelerating, boosting productivity and expertise within companies.
- Rather than causing mass unemployment, AI is shifting the skills and focus needed in the workforce. Historical analogies (e.g., from horses to cars) highlight that successful adaptation relies on embracing change and acquiring new capabilities.
- The most successful software engineers of the future will combine deep technical skills with advanced AI tool proficiency.

## Conclusion

Vivek Vaidya’s analysis concludes that the AI revolution is well underway in both professional software engineering and education. Success depends on a willingness to harness new tools, adapt roles, and stay focused on continuous learning and problem-solving—using AI to augment, not replace, human intelligence.
