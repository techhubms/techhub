# GitHub CEO Steps Down as Microsoft Tightly Integrates GitHub with CoreAI Team

**Author: Jon Swartz**

Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft-owned GitHub, announced he will step down by the end of 2025, marking a pivotal moment in the company's evolution. Dohmke plans to become a founder again, and his departure signals a major organizational shift in Microsoft’s strategy for its AI-driven developer tooling.

## Background

- Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018 for $7.5 billion, initially operating it as an independent entity.
- Dohmke’s nearly four-year tenure as CEO helped establish GitHub as a remote-first, global platform for developers.

## Organizational Changes

- With Dohmke’s departure, Microsoft will not appoint a new GitHub CEO; existing GitHub leadership will now report directly to Microsoft’s CoreAI engineering team.
- CoreAI oversees Microsoft’s platform, tools, and AI engineering divisions, tasked with building advanced AI platforms and developer tools for internal and external users.
- Julia Liuson's shift to report to Jay Parikh, head of CoreAI, demonstrates Microsoft's intent to tightly integrate AI development and engineering with GitHub's innovation culture.

## Industry Context

- The transition occurs amid fierce competition with Google, startup Cursor, and others in the AI development tools space.
- Microsoft aims to leverage GitHub’s open developer culture while accelerating the execution of its enterprise AI strategies.
- As noted by Mitch Ashley of Futurum Group, “Bringing GitHub to work as part of the CoreAI organization is essential to fully execute AI strategies in such an innovation-rich marketplace.”

## Impact on Developers and AI

- Microsoft’s tighter embrace of GitHub within CoreAI is expected to drive further innovation in AI-powered developer tooling.
- The integration may lead to more rapid advancements in coding automation, AI code assistants, and open collaboration platforms.
- The company reiterates its support for GitHub’s global and open developer community as it navigates this leadership change.
