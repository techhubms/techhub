## Key Takeaways

- **Overview of Windows Server 2025 Security Baseline & App Control**:
  Carlos Mayol Berral explains the foundational role these technologies play in protecting modern server environments against evolving threats. Security Baseline provides a set of recommended security configurations, while App Control allows organizations to specify which applications are permitted to run.

- **Hands-on Demonstrations**:
  Carlos offers step-by-step guidance on how to implement these security features in real-world environments.

### Highlights from the Conversation

- **Applying the Security Baseline**:  
  Administrators can easily apply the Windows Server 2025 Security Baseline using PowerShell or the Windows Admin Center. These tools enable a smoother, more automated rollout of baseline security settings, reducing human error and improving consistency across servers.
  
- **Centralized Policy Management with Azure Arc**:  
  Azure Arc allows for the centralized management of server security policies, not just across Azure VMs but on-premises servers and multi-cloud environments as well. This facilitates consistent policy enforcement and easier compliance audits.

- **Security Best Practices**:  
  The discussion highlights approaches and tools that help ensure robust server security, from leveraging built-in Windows Server controls to integrating with Microsoft's cloud management solutions.

- **Demos & Practical Guidance**:
  The video component, referenced in the article, walks viewers through:
  - How to deploy and manage the Windows Server 2025 Security Baseline.
  - Using App Control to restrict unauthorized applications.
  - Streamlining configuration via PowerShell scripts and Windows Admin Center.

## Why These Features Matter

Threats to server infrastructure are increasingly sophisticated. Security Baseline and App Control serve as foundational elements in defense-in-depth strategies, helping to:

- Reduce attack surface (by enforcing least-privilege configurations)
- Prevent execution of unapproved software (mitigating malware risk)
- Increase compliance with organizational and industry standards
- Enable hybrid and multi-cloud security management (via Azure Arc)

## Who Should Watch/Read

- IT administrators responsible for Windows Server environments
- Security professionals interested in Microsoft’s latest security capabilities
- Anyone modernizing their server infrastructure or moving toward hybrid cloud
