.NET Foundation News and Blog explains how developers can integrate structured logging in Sentry with their .NET, MAUI, and ASP.NET Core projects for enhanced debugging and monitoring.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Integrating Sentry Logging with .NET Applications

Sentry is an application monitoring platform that enables developers to quickly identify and fix errors by providing comprehensive context such as stack traces, app and device state, and performance data. While Sentry has long supported every major language and framework, including [.NET](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/), [MAUI](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/guides/maui/), and [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/), it now also supports structured logging.

With the addition of structured logging, you can:

- Send logs directly to Sentry for a unified monitoring experience.
- Correlate logs with issues, traces, and session replays in the Sentry dashboard.
- See rich debugging information and application state alongside your logs.

### Getting Started

You can start sending logs to Sentry in your .NET, MAUI, or ASP.NET Core project with just a few lines of code. Detailed setup instructions and best practices are available in the [Sentry .NET logging documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/logs/).

Unified logging and monitoring in Sentry streamlines debugging for .NET developers, offering greater visibility into application health and performance.
