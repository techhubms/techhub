# Perforce Adds AI-Driven Synthetic Data Generation to Delphix Platform for DevOps Testing

**Author: Mike Vizard**

Perforce Software has enhanced its Delphix DevOps Data Platform by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities built on a small language model (SLM). This development empowers DevOps teams to generate synthetic, realistic test data by leveraging data masking automation instead of connecting to a large language model (LLM). The new SLM is based on the open-source Llama project from Meta.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **SLM-Based Synthetic Data Creation:**
  - Automates creation of non-sensitive data closely mimicking real production data.
  - Enables DevOps teams to test applications safely without exposing sensitive information.
  - Particularly valuable for organizations in regulated industries or with air-gapped IT environments where external connectivity is prohibited.

- **Compliance and Security:**
  - Supports secure compliance testing by masking sensitive data, reducing the risk of data exposure during the software development lifecycle.
  - Facilitates secure, application-specific testing scenarios tailored to vertical industries or regional requirements.

- **AI-Driven DevOps Automation:**
  - Embeds AI agents and models to unify and streamline workflows across the DevOps portfolio.
  - Eliminates the manual effort required to integrate data masking scripts and frameworks.
  - AI agents can collaborate within a unified orchestration framework.

- **Future Capabilities:**
  - Upcoming AI-powered discovery tools to identify sensitive data in application environments.
  - Planned automation for delivering masked data to MLOps pipelines for model training and inference workflows.

## Implementation Context

The Delphix AI feature is positioned as part of a broader Perforce initiative to infuse intelligence throughout DevOps workflows. As AI capabilities become standard across platforms, teams are expected to adapt by leveraging these tools for more reliable and efficient orchestration of testing and data management tasks.

## Industry Impact

Given the emphasis on compliance, security, and automation, Delphix with SLM-based synthetic data generation addresses common DevOps challenges in sectors that require stringent data protection, such as finance, healthcare, and government. The AI-driven approach reduces barriers for deploying and testing applications securely without relying on large, internet-connected models.
