# Top 10 Azure Services Everyone Should Know (2025 Edition)

*Author: Dellenny*

Azure has become the backbone for modern IT infrastructure, development, and operations. Here are the top ten Azure services to prioritize in 2025 and why each stands out.

## 1. Azure Virtual Machines (Compute)

- **Purpose**: Deploy Windows/Linux virtual servers in the cloud
- **Why it matters**: Ideal for legacy workloads, custom apps, and full OS control
- **Typical use**: Server migration, custom environments, high configuration needs

## 2. Azure App Service / Web Apps (PaaS)

- **Purpose**: Host web apps, APIs, mobile backends without managing infrastructure
- **Why it matters**: Lets developers focus purely on code, speeds up deployments
- **When to use**: Scalable web applications, REST APIs, mobile backend services

## 3. Azure Functions (Serverless)

- **Purpose**: Run code on-demand, triggered by events, no server management
- **Why it matters**: Cost-effective scaling, fits microservices, event-driven automation
- **When to use**: Background processing, automation, event handling

## 4. Azure Blob Storage / Storage Accounts

- **Purpose**: Store unstructured data (files, media, backups)
- **Why it matters**: Reliable, scalable, secure object storage
- **When to use**: Data lakes, backups, media hosting

## 5. Azure SQL Database (Managed RDBMS)

- **Purpose**: Managed, scalable relational database service
- **Why it matters**: Handles backups, scaling, high availability for you
- **When to use**: Production relational data without database admin overhead

## 6. Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL, globally distributed)

- **Purpose**: Multi-model, globally distributed database
- **Why it matters**: Global reach, low latency, scale for NoSQL workloads
- **When to use**: High-scale, globally available apps, real-time data

## 7. Azure Data Factory (ETL/Data Integration)

- **Purpose**: Build and orchestrate data workflows (ETL/ELT)
- **Why it matters**: Streamlines data movement and transformation
- **When to use**: Analytics pipelines, data warehouse integration

## 8. Azure Active Directory (Identity & Access Management)

- **Purpose**: Secure identity & access control for users and apps
- **Why it matters**: Central to authentication, SSO, access governance
- **When to use**: Managing cloud/on-prem identities, integrating SaaS apps

## 9. Azure DevOps (CI/CD, Collaboration Tools)

- **Purpose**: Version control, pipelines, agile tools, collaboration
- **Why it matters**: Empowers automation, continuous delivery, teamwork
- **When to use**: Software lifecycle management, automated testing and deployment

## 10. Azure Logic Apps (Workflow Automation)

- **Purpose**: Build automated workflows with low-code/no-code toolset
- **Why it matters**: Links apps/data/services for automated business processes
- **When to use**: Automating repetitive tasks, orchestrating integrations

## Key Trends and Bonus Notes

- **Serverless & Microservices**: Growing adoption of Functions, Logic Apps, Cosmos DB
- **Hybrid/Multicloud**: Azure Arc and Stack technology are bridging cloud and on-premises
- **Security & Governance**: Identity, monitoring, and compliance remain essential (Azure Active Directory, cost controls)
- **SEO/Practical Terms**: Learn to use keywords like “how to use Azure Virtual Machines” and “Azure Data Factory ETL pipelines”

Whether you’re starting or advancing your cloud skills, focus on one Azure service at a time. Master their roles and keep up with growth areas like automation, identity, and security.
