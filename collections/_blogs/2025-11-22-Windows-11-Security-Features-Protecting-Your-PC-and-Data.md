# Windows 11 Security Features: Protecting Your PC and Data

**Author:** John Edward

In today’s world, digital security isn’t just technical—it’s essential for safeguarding your work, memories, and identity. Windows 11 introduces significant security upgrades designed to keep threats at bay and make your computing experience more resilient and hassle-free.

## Chip-Level Protection and Hardware Requirements

- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0**: Embedded in your system’s motherboard, TPM 2.0 stores sensitive information such as encryption keys and passwords, keeping them isolated from potential software attacks.
- **Secure Boot**: Integrated into UEFI firmware, Secure Boot ensures only trusted, digitally signed code can run during startup—stopping rootkits and bootkits before they launch.

## Core Isolation Through Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)

Windows 11 employs VBS to isolate critical system components. This "core isolation" technology uses hardware virtualization to keep the Windows kernel and security solutions in a separate memory space.

- **Memory Integrity (HVCI)** protects core processes by verifying runtime code integrity and preventing malicious code injection.

## Passwordless Authentication: Identity Protection

- **Windows Hello** enables biometric logins via face, fingerprint, or PIN. Protected by TPM and VBS, these methods outperform traditional passwords for security and convenience.
- **Passkeys** replace passwords with device-bound cryptographic credentials, making phishing attacks far less effective.
- **Enhanced Phishing Protection** monitors password entries and warns users if their Windows password is entered into a suspicious website, even in third-party browsers.

## Microsoft Defender Suite: Built-In Defense Tools

- **Defender Antivirus** provides always-on, real-time defense against malware, ransomware, and spyware.
- **Smart App Control (SAC)** uses cloud-based AI to block untrusted or malicious applications before they run, starting in “Evaluation Mode” on new devices.
- **Ransomware Protection** with Controlled Folder Access ensures only trusted apps can modify important folders, directly blocking ransomware attempts.

## Everyday Security Layers

- **BitLocker Encryption** (Windows 11 Pro) provides full-disk encryption, keeping data unreadable if a device is stolen.
- **Windows Defender Firewall** blocks unauthorized network traffic, guarding against external threats.
- **Dynamic Lock** automatically secures your PC when your paired smartphone moves out of Bluetooth range.

Windows 11 builds security into the hardware and software stack, reducing reliance on add-on antivirus programs. By default, users benefit from robust protection that runs quietly in the background, making everyday computing safer and simpler.

## Summary

Windows 11’s security features—including TPM, Secure Boot, VBS, Windows Hello, passkeys, Defender, and encryption—work together to create a modern, highly effective shield. These technologies help users defend their devices and data from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats without complicated manual configurations.
