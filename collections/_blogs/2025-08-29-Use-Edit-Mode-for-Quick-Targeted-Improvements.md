# Use Edit Mode for Quick, Targeted Improvements

*Posted by Randy Pagels on Aug 29, 2025*

Efficiently improving your code doesn't always require building new features from scratch. GitHub Copilot's **Edit Mode** allows developers to polish, refactor, and enhance existing code simply by describing what they want changed.

## What is Edit Mode?

**Edit Mode** is a focused Copilot feature where you highlight a block of code and enter a prompt, and Copilot executes targeted transformations:

- **Rewrite logic for clarity**
- **Simplify complex sections**
- **Adapt to specific coding styles**
- **Introduce error handling**

## ProTip: Instantly Polish Your Code

Rather than manual rewrites, select your code and tell Copilot precisely what you need. Examples include:

1. **Simplify Complex Logic**
   - `# Rewrite this function to be easier to read without changing its behavior`
   - Copilot will refactor for clarity while preserving functionality.

2. **Match a Coding Style**
   - `// Update this function to use async/await instead of promises`
   - Copilot modernizes code to fit style guidelines.

3. **Add Error Handling Automatically**
   - `// Add try/catch blocks to handle potential runtime errors`
   - Instantly improves reliability.

## Agent Mode: Scaling Up Improvements

Use **Agent Mode** when you want Copilot to apply similar changes across multiple files:

- *Example*: "Review all service files and update them to follow the same error-handling pattern."
- Great for maintaining consistency on larger codebases.

## Extra Prompts to Try

- `# Refactor this loop into a more concise version`
- `# Add XML or JSDoc comments to describe parameters and return values`
- `# Replace deprecated methods with supported alternatives`

## Key Takeaway

Edit Mode serves as a precise developer assistant—interpret your intent and make accurate improvements to code, one section at a time. For broader changes, Agent Mode makes it easy to automate patterns throughout your codebase.
