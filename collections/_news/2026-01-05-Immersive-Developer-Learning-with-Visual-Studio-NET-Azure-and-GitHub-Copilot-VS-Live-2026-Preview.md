# Welcome to 2026: A Growth Year for Developers

*By Jim Harrer*

## Reflecting on Developer Learning Trends

As 2026 begins, developers continue to seek out deep, practical learning opportunities. The popularity of [VS Live! Orlando session replays](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRcrdj7sPw2ln9VXOmxy2F8P) (viewed nearly 30,000 times over the holidays) underscores a persistent demand for actionable technical content, even outside the normal work calendar.

### Key Session Trends from VS Live! Orlando

- **The Road to Visual Studio 2026: Building a Faster, Smarter IDE**
- **C# Source Generators: Why They Matter and How to Use Them**
- **Next-Level Debugging with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio**
- **Aspire, Beyond the Basics**
- **Essential Visual Studio Features**
- **Fast Focus: Caching Options in .NET**

Developers gravitated to sessions covering:

- Improvements and advanced features in **Visual Studio 2026**
- Practical .NET topics (source generators, caching, debugging)
- Integration of **GitHub Copilot** for smarter, AI-powered development
- Best practices in architecture and tooling

## From Watching To Immersive Hands-On Learning

While on-demand content has its value, the real breakthrough comes from immersive, in-person learning where developers:

- Work on real code, step by step
- Interact directly with instructors and peers
- Apply concepts immediately and ask questions in real time
- Engage in scenario-based, not just feature-based, education

### Why VS Live! Immersion Stands Out

- Hands-on labs (Monday & Friday): Instructor-led, real-world coding with direct Q&A
- Deep technical sessions (Tuesday–Thursday): Focused on Visual Studio, .NET, Azure, GitHub, AI, cloud-native, DevOps, security, and data
- Small cohorts (capped at ~500): Personalized attention and meaningful engagement
- Access to Microsoft product managers, engineers, and the Visual Studio team

## Event Options for 2026

### VS Live! Las Vegas (March 16–20)

- High-energy, easily accessible for individuals and teams alike
- Full week blending hands-on labs and deep-dive sessions

### VS Live! at Microsoft HQ, Redmond (July 27–31)

- Unique campus experience, direct conversations with Azure and Visual Studio product managers
- Exclusive networking with the Visual Studio PM Team

Both options offer:

- Immersive labs, scenario-based learnings, and expert-led sessions
- Opportunities for personalized technical guidance and community building

## Registration Incentives

- **Visual Studio subscribers**: Up to $900 registration discount via [my.visualstudio.com](https://aka.ms/myvs)
- **Non-subscribers**: Use Priority Code `VSLMS` for up to $600 off ([Las Vegas](https://vslive.com/events/las-vegas-2026/home.aspx), [Redmond](https://vslive.com/events/microsofthq-2026/home.aspx))
- Connect with engineers and product leaders behind the technologies you use every day

## Why Attend?

- Learn from experts on **Visual Studio 2026**, modern .NET, Azure, DevOps, security, AI-assisted workflows, and GitHub Copilot
- Build practical skills you can use immediately
- Get direct, actionable answers to your technical questions

As summarized by an Orlando attendee:
> “This is the best conference if you want to learn things you can actually use when you get back to the office.”
