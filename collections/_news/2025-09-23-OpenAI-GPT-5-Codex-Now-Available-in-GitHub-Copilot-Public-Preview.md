# OpenAI GPT-5-Codex Rolls Out in GitHub Copilot Public Preview

OpenAI’s GPT-5-Codex model, tailored for agentic coding tasks, is now gradually rolling out in GitHub Copilot. This new model brings advanced capabilities for developers looking to leverage state-of-the-art AI coding assistance.

## Availability

- **Supported Plans**: Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise.
- Access via the Copilot Chat model picker in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), within ask, edit, and agent modes.
- The rollout is staged and only supported on GitHub Copilot version v1.104.1 or higher. Users should update to the latest version to check for availability.

## How to Enable GPT-5-Codex

- **Enterprise & Business Administrators**: Must enable the GPT-5-Codex policy in Copilot settings. After this, users in the organization will see GPT-5-Codex in the VS Code model picker.
- **Pro & Pro+ Users**: Select GPT-5-Codex from the VS Code picker and confirm the activation with the one-time prompt.
