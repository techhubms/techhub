# GitHub Advanced Security Trials Expanded for Enterprise Customers

GitHub Enterprise customers now have increased access to self-serve trials of GitHub Advanced Security. New eligibility rules allow enterprises that have already completed a previous GitHub Advanced Security trial (and did not purchase) to begin another trial after 180 days.

## Key Features

- **GitHub Code Security**: Evaluate built-in code scanning and vulnerability detection.
- **GitHub Secret Protection**: Protect repositories against accidental secret leaks.
- **Self-Serve Access**: Enterprise administrators can initiate trials directly from the “Billing and licensing” page.

## How To Start a Trial

1. Navigate to your GitHub Enterprise “Billing and licensing” page.
2. Follow provided steps to activate an Advanced Security trial.
3. See the official documentation for details: [self-serve GitHub Advanced Security trials](https://docs.github.com/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security).

Enterprises that previously completed a trial can now begin a new one after a 180-day waiting period, enabling more flexibility in evaluating security options.

## Learn More

For comprehensive information on the features and setup process, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/trialing-github-advanced-security).
