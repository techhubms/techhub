# Microsoft Security and the Future of Agentic AI at RSAC™ 2026

The era of AI is driving unprecedented changes for security professionals. As organizations move towards human-led and agent-operated models—what Microsoft calls 'Frontier Firms'—the challenge is how to secure environments where millions of AI agents will soon operate. At RSAC 2026, Microsoft Security demonstrates how security must be as ambient and autonomous as the AI it protects, delivering insight, strategy, and tools to help organizations stay ahead.

## Microsoft’s Vision: Ambient, Autonomous, Agentic Security

- **Agentic Era Trends:** Organizations are rapidly integrating agentic AI, with IDC projecting 1.3 billion AI agents in use by 2028. This scale demands security that is omnipresent and self-governing.
- **Security as a Core Primitive:** Security is being woven into every layer of Microsoft’s platform and services, informed by over 100 trillion daily security signals.
- **AI-First Platform:** Microsoft’s security stack is built to secure AI at every layer, with dedicated solutions such as Agent 365 for comprehensive observability.
