stclarke recounts how Min-ji So, a Deaf webtoon creator, used Microsoft Copilot and the AI for Impact program to break down language obstacles and empower herself—and others—to tell richer, more independent stories.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Empowering Deaf Creators: Min-ji So's Journey with Microsoft Copilot and AI

Min-ji So, a Deaf webtoon creator, has long used illustrations to share her experiences as a Deaf parent raising a hearing child. Facing ongoing language barriers—especially the complexity of written Korean—she and many other Deaf creators struggled to independently craft polished stories for their audiences.

## The Challenge: Language Barriers in Creative Work

Min-ji found that expressing herself in written Korean introduced creative limits, since sign language is often the primary language for Deaf individuals in Korea. Peer feedback networks proved unsustainable, as the demand for grammatical refinement quickly outstripped supply.

## Discovering AI as a Creative Partner

Her journey changed when she encountered conversational AI, particularly Microsoft Copilot, through the Microsoft AI for Impact program. The program offered foundational AI education and hands-on workshops aimed at nonprofit and social impact projects. Through Copilot, Min-ji experimented with using AI to correct grammar, generate story ideas, and ultimately co-create richer stories. She described Copilot not just as a grammar corrector, but as an inspiring creative partner capable of asking questions that sparked new narrative directions.

## Building Tools for the Community: The Webtoon Storyboard Assistant

Min-ji’s breakthrough was developing the 'Webtoon Storyboard Assistant' AI agent. Instead of requiring creators to ask detailed questions, the AI proactively prompts them, easing the language burden and generating both grammatically precise and more vivid storyboards. This reversed-question workflow increased efficiency, lowered frustration, and improved story quality for Deaf creators.

## Broadening Impact through AI Education

In November 2025, Min-ji extended her insights to the broader community by running workshops for aspiring Deaf and hard-of-hearing creators. These sessions built confidence and provided step-by-step guidance on using AI as a creative tool, reducing reliance on external grammar feedback and enabling greater creative independence.

## Conclusion: AI as a Bridge for Creative Expression

Min-ji So’s story demonstrates how AI, and specifically Microsoft Copilot, can serve as a bridge for overcoming complex language barriers in creative contexts. By developing practical, accessible AI tools and sharing her experience through education, she has fostered a more inclusive environment where Deaf creators can confidently tell their own stories.
