# Budget Bytes: Building Real AI Apps on Azure for Under $25

**Authors:** Jasmine Greenaway and Pablo Lopes  

## What is Budget Bytes?

Budget Bytes is a new, ongoing series aimed at helping developers create powerful, end-to-end AI solutions on Microsoft Azure for $25 or less. Each episode breaks down the development process step by step, covering real costs and focusing on genuine developer experiences—including mistakes and debugging. The series emphasizes transparency by tallying up cloud costs live at the end of every episode, making cloud AI both accessible and affordable.

**Key Features:**

- **Authentic, hands-on development:** Watch actual workflows with all their challenges—not just the polished final result.
- **Cost transparency:** Each solution’s cost is detailed, so there are no surprises.
- **Practical design patterns:** Gain exposure to tools, APIs, and development strategies you can apply immediately in your own projects.
- **Open-source samples:** Every demo is backed by a GitHub repository, so you can follow along and deploy the solutions yourself.

## What You’ll Learn

- **New Azure tools and technologies:** Each episode introduces current Microsoft developer tools, such as Microsoft Foundry, Copilot Studio, and Model Context Protocol.
- **Real-world architectures:** See how experienced developers create robust AI solutions efficiently (both technically and financially).
- **Step-by-step deployment:** All solutions are deployable to your own Azure subscription for a hands-on learning experience.
- **Continuous skill-building:** Each episode links out to relevant Microsoft Learn modules, deepening your mastery of Azure AI tools.
- **Beginner-friendly use cases:** Especially useful if you’re new to Azure SQL—real learning with actionable use cases, not just theory.
