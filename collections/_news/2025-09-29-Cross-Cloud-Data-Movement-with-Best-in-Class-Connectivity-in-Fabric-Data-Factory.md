# Cross-Cloud Data Movement with Best-in-Class Connectivity in Fabric Data Factory

Microsoft Fabric is reshaping the landscape of AI-ready data estates by consolidating data, governance, and compute on a unified SaaS platform designed for mission-critical analytics. This blog details new enhancements for Fabric Data Factory, targeting seamless, secure, and scalable data integration across clouds and environments.

## Key Innovations

### Copy Job for Petabyte-Scale Cross-Cloud Data Movement

- **Bulk and Incremental Copy**: Move massive datasets between Azure, AWS, Snowflake, or on-premises sources with managed execution.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Keep destinations like SQL Database and Snowflake updated in real time with inserts, updates, and deletes.
- **Observability and Error Handling**: Built-in tools improve reliability and reduce operational overhead.
- **Secure, Network-Compliant Access**: Connect to protected data sources behind firewalls using VNet Gateway support.

### Enhanced Integration and Automation

- **Copy Job Activity in Pipelines**: Orchestrate data movement end-to-end directly within Fabric Data Factory pipelines.
- **Connection Parameterization**: Use variable libraries for smooth CI/CD deployments across dev, test, and production.
- **Multiple Schedules and Formats**: Run jobs on custom timelines and use new file formats like Iceberg and JSON.
- **Database Views as Sources**: Enable complex ingestion from database views for both full and incremental loads.

### Enterprise-Grade Connectivity

- **Over 170 Connectors**: Integrate with a rapidly growing set of data sources and destinations.
- **VNet and On-Premises Data Gateways**: Ensure secure transfer across private networks and cloud environments.
- **Dataflow Gen2 and Pipelines Support**: Power reliable integrations and advanced workflows for modern data estates.
