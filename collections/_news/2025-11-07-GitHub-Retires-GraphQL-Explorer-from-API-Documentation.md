# GitHub Retires GraphQL Explorer from API Documentation

## Overview

GitHub has officially retired the GraphQL Explorer from its API documentation, effective November 7, 2025. This change follows a prior announcement and impacts users who relied on the Explorer for testing and prototyping with the GitHub GraphQL API.

## Who Is Affected

- Developers who used the GraphQL Explorer for experimenting with the GitHub GraphQL API.
- Most users are not required to take any action.

## Reason for Retirement

- **Technical Debt**: Ongoing maintenance proved costly, especially regarding security and accessibility.
- **Reliance on Third-Party Libraries**: The Explorer’s dependencies could not be kept compliant with current standards.
- **Limited Usage**: The tool was not widely used, supporting the decision to retire it.

## Recommendations for Developers

- **Switch to Local Tools**: Developers should transition to local GraphQL clients for interacting with the GitHub GraphQL API.
- **Updated Documentation**: GitHub provides updated guidance for using popular GraphQL clients: [Using GraphQL Clients](https://docs.github.com/graphql/guides/using-graphql-clients).

## Additional Resources

- [GraphQL API documentation](https://docs.github.com/graphql)
- [GitHub Community Announcements](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements)
