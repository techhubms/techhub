stclarke explores how Microsoft's Generative AI for Permitting project uses Azure OpenAI and advanced AI tooling to revolutionize permitting for clean energy, delivering real-world results in the nuclear and renewable sectors.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Generative AI for Permitting: Accelerating Clean Energy with Microsoft

## Mission and Impact

Permitting is a critical challenge in scaling clean energy infrastructure, often taking years and costing hundreds of millions. Microsoft’s cross-company team developed an AI-powered system to streamline and automate this process, aiming to remove bottlenecks impeding decarbonization.

## Hackathon Roots to Commercial Solution

Initially created during the 2024 Microsoft Garage Hackathon, 'Project GreenLight' united 53 Microsoft employees to tackle the tedious permitting process. Driven by feedback from industry partnerships (including the Repowering Coal Consortium and Terra Praxis), the project set out to address core pain points:

- **Automated Document Creation** with generative AI
- **Copilot for Permitting Engineers** (built on Azure and running in secure, tenant-controlled environments)
- **Pre-Submission Review for Regulators** using AI to flag missing or non-compliant information

Prototypes rapidly matured into solutions now used by real customers across energy, mining, and regulatory sectors—delivering tangible business value.

## Key Technologies & Architecture

- **Azure OpenAI Service** powers document generation and review, providing robust natural language capabilities while maintaining data security
- **Semantic Kernel and Kernel Memory** enable intelligent sourcing and structuring of regulatory information and supporting data
- **Agentic AI Workflows** coordinate drafting, reviewing, and refining permitting documents, cutting creation times from months to minutes

The modular architecture allows expansion to various energy applications (nuclear, wind, mining) and continued integration with customer data sources.

## Real-World Results

- Productivity gains between 25–75% in targeted workflows
- Engagement with global energy regulators and industry customers
- Now a commercial workstream within Microsoft's MCAPS Energy & Resources

## Broader Impact and Team

This workstream not only increases operational speed but also sets new precedents for AI-driven regulatory compliance and government productivity worldwide.

The project catalyzed collaboration across Microsoft and garnered support from senior leadership, shaping policy and energy strategies beyond product development.
