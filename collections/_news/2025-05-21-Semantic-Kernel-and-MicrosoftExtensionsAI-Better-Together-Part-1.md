In this article, author Roger Barreto introduces readers to the beginning of a series focused on the integration between Microsoft Semantic Kernel and Microsoft.Extensions.AI, aiming to clarify their roles and demonstrate best practices. <!--excerpt_end--> The article acknowledges common questions developers have, such as whether Microsoft’s AI extensions are meant to replace Semantic Kernel or when it is appropriate to use one over the other. While this initial post serves as an overview, Barreto promises future installments will provide hands-on examples and deeper exploration of leveraging the Semantic Kernel in conjunction with the Microsoft.Extensions.AI abstractions. The series is poised to become a helpful resource for developers wishing to understand and effectively use both tools within their AI projects.
