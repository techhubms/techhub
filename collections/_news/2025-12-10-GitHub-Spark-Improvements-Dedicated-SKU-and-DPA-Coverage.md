# GitHub Spark: Improvements, Dedicated SKU, and DPA Coverage

GitHub Spark continues to evolve, delivering features that enhance both administrative control and the developer experience:

## Spark Now Covered by the GitHub Data Protection Agreement (DPA)

As of October 27th, Spark adheres to GitHub's Data Protection Agreement, aligning its data handling with products in general availability. This benefits organizations needing strict data policies, allowing Spark usage like any other production-grade GitHub tool.

Learn more in the [GitHub DPA for previews documentation](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/github-terms/github-dpa-previews).

## Dedicated SKU & Budget Controls for Spark

- Organization admins see a separate Spark SKU for billing, allowing clearer separation from other Copilot products.
- Granular budget controls and overage policies can be set for Spark specifically, or bundled across premium request products.
- Controls are accessible in the Billing and Licensing tab in admin settings.

## Visual Quality Improvements in Generated Apps

Recent updates deliver higher quality, more unique designs for generated apps. The Spark agent now produces apps with enhanced UI and UX, with noticeable improvements shown in several side-by-side comparisons:

- To-do app
- Actions app
- Timer app

## Spark Agent Enhancements

- Better respect for manual user edits—manual changes are no longer overwritten.
- Improved handling of highly complex apps beyond model context, so even advanced use cases get robust code generation.
- The live app preview now appears immediately after code generation completes.
- Prevents multiple simultaneous agent requests to curb errors.

## Repository Creation Admin Setting

- Org admins can require all Spark-generated repositories to be created within the organization, rather than personal accounts. This feature is off by default and can be enabled in Copilot Settings.

## Other Improvements

- Enhanced accessibility throughout the Spark interface.
- Security fixes: Removed test paths for certain domains.
- Bug fixes resolving issues in UI, publishing, iteration, and repository creation.
- Manual commits to Spark projects are now preserved reliably.

## How to Try

- Visit [github.com/spark](https://github.com/spark) to utilize these updates for new app development.
- Note: Features in public preview may change.

These updates empower both organizations and developers with more administrative control, enhanced privacy compliance, and improved development flow through GitHub Spark.
