# Visual Studio 2026 Released: GitHub Cloud Agent Preview and Copilot Features

**Author:** Simona Liao

Visual Studio 2026 is now generally available, bringing a suite of improvements for developers focused on productivity and AI-powered enhancements. This update features:

## Key Highlights

- **Performance Improvements**: Faster load times and refined user experience.
- **Redesigned Interface**: Updated visuals promote ease-of-use and modern workflows.
- **AI-Driven Development**: Deep integration of AI features throughout the IDE.

## GitHub Cloud Agent Preview

The new **GitHub Cloud Agent** is available as a preview within Visual Studio 2026. Developers can enable this feature via the Copilot badge dropdown under Settings & Options → Coding Agent (Preview). Once active, the Cloud Agent supports automation of repetitive coding tasks including:

- UI cleanups
- Refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Multi-file edits

The Cloud Agent works with solutions connected to GitHub repositories. You can delegate tasks directly from Visual Studio and review agent-generated pull requests without leaving the IDE. This helps you focus on core development while routine tasks are handled automatically.

## Copilot Actions in Context Menu

Copilot Actions are now integrated into the Visual Studio context menu, making it easy to access AI assistance without typing. With one click, you can:

- Generate code comments/explanations
- Perform “Optimize Selection” (requires code selection) for suggestions on performance, maintainability, reliability, and architecture

This streamlines coding workflows and brings Copilot’s power closer to the editing experience.

## Copilot Intent Detection in All-In-One Search

Searching for files and symbols is now smarter. With **Did You Mean**, Copilot analyzes your search term and suggests corrections if you mistype or forget an exact file name. This ensures more accurate search results, helping developers quickly find what they need.

## Additional Notes

- All highlighted features are exclusive to Visual Studio 2026.
- The team is actively seeking feedback to refine these new tools.

Stay tuned for future updates and explore these latest advancements to accelerate your development workflow.
