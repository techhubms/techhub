# Commit-by-Commit Review and Enhanced Filtering in GitHub Pull Request Files Changed Experience

GitHub has addressed a longstanding developer need by enabling detailed commit-by-commit reviews directly from the updated 'Files changed' page. This latest update introduces several workflow enhancements for improved code reviews and developer productivity.

## 🔍 Key Features

### Review Commit-by-Commit

- Developers can now select all, some, or individual commits to review from the ‘Files changed’ page without switching to the classic 'Commits' tab.
- Updated commit filter streamlines selecting commit ranges or single commits via the toolbar or the `C` keyboard shortcut.
- All ‘Files changed’ URLs consolidate under the new `/changes` path, with backward compatibility via redirects from old routes.

### File Filter Improvements

- A blue dot indicator now appears when file filters are active.
- The filter menu includes a new 'Clear filters' button for easy resets.

## 🚀 Performance Enhancements

- Improved responsiveness for resizing the file tree.
- Faster toggling of 'Minimize comments' and 'Split / Unified' views.
- Clicking 'Refresh' now updates pull requests more quickly without full page reloads.

## 🔧 Additional Fixes and Improvements

- Comments side panel resolves errors more reliably when marking comments as resolved.
- Nonstandard file path characters (such as commas) no longer prevent diffs from loading.
- The `.gitattributes` `linguist-generated` attribute is now respected as intended.
- Keyboard shortcuts:
  - `T` focuses the file filter and reveals the file tree.
  - `C` opens the commit filter.

## 🧪 How to Access

- The new commit-by-commit review features are available in the updated 'Files changed' experience.
- To try the new interface, click **Try the new experience** at the top of the classic 'Files changed' page.

## ❤ Feedback

Your input is valued. Problems, questions, or issues can be reported and discussed in the [“Files changed” preview feedback discussion](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback).
