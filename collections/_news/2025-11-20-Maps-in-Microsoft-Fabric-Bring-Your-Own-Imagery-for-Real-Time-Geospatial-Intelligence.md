Microsoft Fabric Blog showcases new mapping capabilities for Real-Time Intelligence, allowing users to add their own imagery and spatial data for enhanced geospatial analysis and decision-making.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Maps in Microsoft Fabric: Bring Your Own Imagery for Real-Time Geospatial Intelligence

Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence workload now empowers users to integrate their own analysis-ready imagery and specialized raster layers directly from OneLake. Announced recently at FabCon Europe and expanded at Ignite, the latest enhancements include:

- **Support for imagery and raster data from OneLake**
- **Custom labels for points, lines, and polygons on user-defined layers**
- **Sharing of maps through Org Apps for team collaboration**

## Why Geospatial Context Matters

Integrating spatial context with real-time operations and proprietary imagery enables organizations to:

- Pinpoint asset locations
- Monitor emerging risks
- Optimize logistics and crew deployments
- Improve decision-making and operational planning

## Use Case Examples

### Vegetation Management

Using frequently updated imagery from the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/), organizations can detect where vegetation encroaches on power lines. Fabric Maps enables extraction of high-risk areas by intersecting these zones with powerline corridors for precise crew assignments. Workflow sharing via Org Apps enhances collaboration for inspection and maintenance.

### Construction Monitoring

Weekly site imagery can be imported, custom-labeled to track project milestones, and compared over time for early detection of delays. This proactive monitoring supports project efficiency and improved outcomes.

### ESG Dashboards and Sustainability Insights

Overlay land cover or canopy raster imagery with asset portfolios, then label sites with green space scores and energy use data in Fabric to generate actionable sustainability dashboards and insights.

## Getting Started and Further Resources
