stclarke details how residents of the Kakuma refugee camp worked with Microsoft AI for Good Lab and partners to overhaul their map system using AI, satellite imagery, and hands-on community data collection.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Upgrading Kakuma Refugee Camp Maps with AI and Community Collaboration

## Introduction

The Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya, home to over 300,000 people, faced challenges with outdated maps that hindered aid delivery, infrastructure planning, and emergency response. The unique, irregular structure of the camp made traditional mapping difficult, prompting a novel collaboration utilizing AI and community engagement.

## Collaborative Effort

- **Microsoft AI for Good Lab** provided machine learning expertise and developed open-source models for mapping features like solar panels, buildings, and infrastructure.
- **UNHCR’s Hive** (UN Refugee Agency's innovation lab) outlined core mapping challenges and requirements.
- **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)** organized on-the-ground data collection and integrated local knowledge by training residents as mappers.

## Modernizing Maps with AI & Community Input

- The project combined remote sensing (via drones and satellite imagery) with AI-driven pattern recognition to speed up map updates.
- Community members performed hands-on mapping and feature tagging, collecting 'ground truth' data and increasing the system's accuracy.
- Manual and AI-powered efforts focused on mapping solar panels, buildings, sanitation, and electrical networks, reflecting real-life infrastructure used by residents.

## Technical Approach

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Microsoft’s team trained models on resident-tagged and drone-captured imagery, enabling rapid detection of critical features.
- **Azure Cloud**: Used for model training and scalable data processing.
- **Open Access**: Tools and datasets released as open source on GitHub, ensuring transparency and encouraging global adoption for similar challenges.

## Community Impact

- Empowered refugees as stewards of their environment, building capacity for future data-driven projects.
- Improved mapping enabled better service provision, infrastructure planning, and long-term urban integration.
- Community-driven process fostered ownership and ongoing map accuracy.
- Open-source datasets and tools now available for developers, researchers, and NGOs worldwide.

## Learnings and Outlook

- AI was a force multiplier: "AI didn’t replace [locals], but expanded their capabilities." (Juan M. Lavista Ferres, Microsoft AI For Good Lab)
- Partnerships and local knowledge were critical to the project's success.
- The project demonstrated a replicable model for blending AI, open data, and grassroots collaboration for humanitarian impact.
