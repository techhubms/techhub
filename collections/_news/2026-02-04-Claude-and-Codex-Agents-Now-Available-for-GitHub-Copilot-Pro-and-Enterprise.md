# Claude and Codex Agents Now Available for GitHub Copilot Pro+ and Enterprise

GitHub has announced the public preview of Claude (Anthropic) and OpenAI Codex coding agents, now accessible to Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise customers. These agents help accelerate development workflows by enabling advanced AI-powered coding assistance across GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, and VS Code.

## Key Features

- **Agent Sessions Across Platforms**: Start sessions and assign tasks to Claude and Codex from GitHub web UI, GitHub Mobile, or in VS Code.
- **Integrated Collaboration**: Assign agents to issues and pull requests to generate or iterate on draft PRs. Use the agents as assignees to automate coding tasks and feedback loops.
- **Seamless Access**: No extra subscription is required—access is included in existing Copilot Pro+ or Enterprise plans. Each session consumes one premium request during the public preview.

## How to Enable Claude and Codex

### For Copilot Pro+ Subscribers

1. Go to your [Copilot coding agent settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot/coding_agent?utm_source=changelog-3p-agents-cca-settings-cta&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=agent-3p-platform-feb-2026).
2. Select which repositories you want agents to access.
3. Toggle Claude, Codex, or both agents on.

### For Copilot Enterprise Admins

1. Enable agents at the enterprise level: Go to **Enterprise AI Controls**, open the Agents tab, and enable Claude and/or Codex under Partner Agents.
2. At the organization level: In org Settings, go to Copilot > Coding agent, and enable Claude and/or Codex.

## Using Coding Agents

- **From GitHub Web & Mobile**:
  - Create new agent sessions from the Agents tab in enabled repositories, or from the main header (web) or Home/Repository views (mobile).
  - Assign agents to issues using the Assignees dropdown. The agent(s) will start work and submit draft PRs for review.
- **In Pull Requests**:
  - Assign an agent to an open PR for them to help iterate or follow up on feedback.
  - View session overviews and activity logs with the View Session button.
- **In VS Code (v1.109 or later)**:
  - Open the Agent sessions view via the chat icon or Command Palette and select your agent (Claude, Codex, or Copilot).
  - Choose session types: Local, Cloud, or Background (the latter is Copilot-only).
