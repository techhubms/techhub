In this article, Chris Reddington explores how developers can leverage GitHub Copilot’s agentic coding agent, its chat modes, and the remote MCP server to efficiently transform issues into thoroughly tested pull requests. <!--excerpt_end--> The guide avoids unnecessary hype and instead presents clear, actionable steps for maximizing Copilot’s features in real-world scenarios.

## Introduction to Agentic Coding

The article explains agentic coding agents—systems that can autonomously draft code solutions by understanding intent from issue descriptions. By outlining practical use cases, Chris demonstrates how Copilot can interpret tasks and propose steps, reducing manual effort.

## Utilizing Chat Modes

Chat modes allow developers to interact conversationally with Copilot, refining code and workflows. The article provides advice on steering these interactions for productive outcomes, getting more relevant code suggestions, and clarifying ambiguities.

## Remote MCP Server

The remote MCP server enables Copilot’s advanced code generation and integration beyond the local environment. Chris provides a walkthrough for connecting, configuring, and leveraging the server, emphasizing security and best practices.

## Workflow: Issue to Tested PR

The core of the article is a practical, step-by-step workflow integrating Copilot’s tools to:

- Convert issues into actionable tasks
- Use Copilot chat to draft code and discuss approaches
- Employ the MCP server for remote processing
- Generate, test, and submit high-quality pull requests

## Conclusion

By following the guide, developers can streamline their development process, automate routine steps, and ensure code quality. Chris’s realistic, no-nonsense approach is ideal for teams seeking to adopt Copilot’s evolving capabilities.
