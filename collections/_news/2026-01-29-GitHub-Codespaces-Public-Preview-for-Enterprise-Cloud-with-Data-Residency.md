# GitHub Codespaces Public Preview for Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency

GitHub Codespaces is now available in public preview for GitHub Enterprise Cloud accounts with data residency. This update enables organizations to leverage secure, configurable, and instantly accessible cloud development environments while ensuring that all sensitive data remains within a specified region for compliance reasons.

## What's New

- **Full Feature Parity**: Organizations receive the complete Codespaces feature set, including all policies and configurations found on the general GitHub platform.
- **Data Residency Compliance**: Codespaces now ensure that all data is stored only within your selected region, helping organizations meet strict compliance requirements.
- **Supported Regions**:
  - Australia
  - European Union (EU)
  - United States (US)
  - Japan (coming soon during preview phase)

## Important Considerations

- Only enterprise or organization-owned Codespaces are supported for GitHub Enterprise Cloud accounts with data residency enabled. User-owned Codespaces are not available for these accounts.
- Enterprises should update organization policies to guarantee that Codespaces are set up with the correct ownership.
- Further information on configuring Codespaces ownership is available in [the official GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/choosing-who-owns-and-pays-for-codespaces-in-your-organization).
