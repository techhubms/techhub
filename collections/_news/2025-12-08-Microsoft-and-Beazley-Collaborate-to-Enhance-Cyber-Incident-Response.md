# Microsoft and Beazley Collaborate to Enhance Cyber Incident Response

Cybersecurity today is not just about building strong technical defenses—it's about how effectively teams can respond when an incident occurs. In this article, Aarti Borkar highlights Microsoft's new partnership with Beazley, a leading cyber insurance provider, to bolster incident response capabilities for organizations worldwide.

## Unified Approach to Cyber Resilience

The current cyberthreat environment requires a unified effort combining incident response experts, insurers, brokers, and legal counsel. This integrated ecosystem is essential for building long-term resilience, enabling organizations to anticipate, withstand, and recover from cyberattacks efficiently.

### Role of Cyber Insurance

Cyber insurance is increasingly critical, providing financial support and strengthening trust during and after a cyber incident. Through the collaboration, Microsoft customers can now benefit from streamlined processes when listing Microsoft Incident Response as their provider in Beazley InfoSec and Media Tech policies.

## Collaboration Highlights
