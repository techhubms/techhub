Allison outlines significant improvements to the GitHub Actions workflow pages, enabling support for large workflows and introducing job status filtering to help teams manage complex automation more effectively.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Improved Performance for GitHub Actions Workflows Page

GitHub Actions workflow pages have received notable performance enhancements:

- **Support for Large Workflows:**
  - Workflows containing more than 300 jobs now render successfully.
  - Lazy loading has been implemented, allowing pages to load smoothly even when dealing with extensive job counts.

- **Job Status Filtering:**
  - Users can now filter jobs based on their status directly within the workflow page.
  - Options include viewing only failed jobs, jobs in progress, or all jobs, which helps focus attention during troubleshooting or monitoring.
  - Example: ![Screenshot of filter based on job status in the workflow page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a32953fb-d806-4c5e-b510-fe1b841f5629)

- **Impact for Teams:**
  - These updates are especially useful for teams managing large monorepo setups or workflows with extensive job matrices, reducing page load issues and improving day-to-day workflow visibility.
