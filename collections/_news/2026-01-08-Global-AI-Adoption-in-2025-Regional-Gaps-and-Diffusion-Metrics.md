stclarke examines worldwide generative AI adoption trends in 2025, highlighting data-driven insights into the digital divide, country rankings, and the influence of open-source AI models like DeepSeek.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Global AI Adoption in 2025: Regional Gaps and Diffusion Metrics

The second half of 2025 saw continued growth in global adoption of generative AI, with the share of people using these tools rising by 1.2 percentage points from earlier in the year. Roughly one in six people worldwide now interacts with generative AI tools—a significant milestone for the technology's mainstream integration.

**Measurement Methodology:**

- AI diffusion is calculated as the share of people who have used a generative AI product during the reported period.
- Microsoft aggregates anonymized telemetry and adjusts for device/OS market share, internet penetration, and country population for greater accuracy.
- Ongoing refinement of this metric is planned, with transparency on methodology and ongoing evaluation by the Microsoft AI Economy Institute ([technical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02781)).

**Key Findings:**

- **Growth Gap**: The digital divide is deepening — AI adoption in the Global North has grown almost twice as fast as in the Global South.
  - 24.7% of the working age population in the Global North has used generative AI tools.
  - Only 14.1% in the Global South have done so.

**Top-Performing Countries:**

- Early and sustained investment in digital infrastructure and AI skilling boosts usage rates.
- The UAE continues to lead globally with 64% of the working-age population using AI, widening its gap over Singapore (now at 60.9%).
- Countries like Norway, Ireland, France, and Spain also maintain strong positions.
- The US remains a leader in AI research and infrastructure but ranks just 24th globally by usage, highlighting the difference between technological leadership and practical, everyday adoption.
- South Korea rose from 25th to 18th place, driven by government support, language-specific AI advances, and relevant consumer applications.

**Impact of Open-Source Platforms:**

- **DeepSeek**, an open-source AI platform adopting MIT licensing and offering services for free, has surged in regions previously underserved by mainstream providers. Its strongest footholds are China, Russia, Iran, Cuba, Belarus, and increasingly Africa (aided by partnerships with Huawei).
- DeepSeek’s success underlines the importance of accessible AI, reducing financial and technical entry barriers and potentially narrowing the digital divide.
- This also spotlights intensifying global competition in AI, especially between China (promoting DeepSeek) and the US (OpenAI, Microsoft-backed models).

**Challenges and Implications:**

- The global AI landscape is increasingly shaped by country-level investments in digital policy and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of open models promoting accessibility.
- Bridging the digital divide requires focus on both innovation and practical adoption, ensuring all regions can benefit from advancements.
- The next era of AI adoption could be powered by new waves of users in previously marginalized or disconnected areas.
