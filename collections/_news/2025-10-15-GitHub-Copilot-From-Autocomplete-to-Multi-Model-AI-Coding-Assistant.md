# GitHub Copilot: From Autocomplete to Multi-Model AI Coding Assistant

Ashley Willis provides an in-depth look at how GitHub Copilot has advanced from a high-powered autocomplete tool to a powerful coding agent deeply woven into developer workflows.

## Key Features and Evolution

- **Agent Mode:** Copilot now tackles cross-file tasks, automates commands, performs module refactoring, and suggests terminal operations without leaving the editor.
- **Coding Agent:** Assign issues to Copilot and it drafts pull requests, code, tests, and provides project-aware context, supporting over 1.2 million PRs every month.
- **Next-Edit Suggestions:** Predicts your next change and offers suggestions inline, streamlining your coding flow.
- **Copilot CLI:** Brings Copilot's capabilities to the terminal for setup, debugging, and scripting tasks.
- **Multi-Model Routing:** Access models from OpenAI, Google Gemini, and more, selecting the right LLM for each task.
- **Custom Instructions and Workspace Prompt Files:** Configure Copilot to follow project-specific conventions and reusable team prompts.
- **JetBrains and VS Code Parity:** Full functionality regardless of your IDE or terminal, meaning consistency across environments.
- **GitHub MCP Server Integration:** Allows secure AI tool access to your code context, supporting robust, centralized workflows.

## Security and Code Quality

- **Copilot Autofix:** Automatically detects and patches vulnerabilities, fixing millions of issues during the year.
- **Integrated Code Review:** Summarizes diffs, flags bugs, and suggests improvements directly in pull requests.
- **Enhanced Model Reasoning:** Higher code readability, fewer errors, better maintainability and reliability.
- **Security Stack:** Integrations with GitHub Advanced Security, CodeQL, Dependabot, and GitHub Actions ensures secure development.
- **Privacy:** Enterprise isolation, audit logs, and tenant controls protect your code and development artifacts.

## Developer-Centric Workflow

- Works natively in the environments developers use: no migration, no new IDE required
- Provides full-stack context—pull requests, reviews, tests, and workflows are all supported
- Scales with teams of all sizes, using insights from over 20 million developers

## Looking Forward

GitHub Copilot continues to advance, with upcoming features extending multi-model integrations and agentic automation. With deep integration into the GitHub development platform, Copilot aims to help every developer ship reliable code faster.
