Allison reports on GitHub Copilot's newly announced support for OpenCode, letting subscribers use their Copilot credentials to access AI-powered coding assistance directly within OpenCode environments.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub Copilot Now Supports OpenCode

GitHub Copilot is expanding its reach by officially supporting integration with OpenCode, an open source agent that assists developers with code generation in their terminal, IDE, or desktop environments. This new partnership allows developers with paid Copilot subscriptions (Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise) to authenticate and use Copilot's AI features directly within OpenCode—no extra AI license required.

## What is OpenCode?

OpenCode is an open source tool designed to help developers write code efficiently across various environments. With the addition of Copilot support, OpenCode users can now invoke GitHub Copilot's AI coding features without switching contexts or managing separate credentials.

- Learn more about OpenCode at [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai/).

## How to Connect Copilot with OpenCode

1. In OpenCode, execute the `/connect` command.
2. Select **GitHub Copilot** during the process.
3. Complete the authentication using GitHub's device login flow.
4. Start leveraging Copilot’s AI-powered assistance through OpenCode.

Developers with eligible Copilot subscriptions (Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise) can readily access this integration. No additional steps are needed beyond the initial authentication. Full setup details can be found in [OpenCode’s provider documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/#github-copilot-support).

## Community and Support

Discussions around this new functionality are ongoing in the [GitHub Community announcements](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements). Both teams encourage feedback as they continue refining the integration.

This update makes it simpler for developers to embed GitHub Copilot into their existing workflows, whether coding directly in their terminal, using their favorite IDE, or working across desktop environments.
