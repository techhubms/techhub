# Microsoft Fabric January 2026 Feature Summary

## Events & Announcements

- **Skill & Certification Upgrades:** Live training sessions available, including exam voucher opportunities for Fabric Analytics Engineer (DP-600) and Data Engineer (DP-700).
- **FabCon Atlanta:** Major event co-located with SQLCon, offering sessions on Fabric, SQL Server 2025, Power BI, Real-Time Intelligence, and AI solutions.

## General Update

- **Acquisition of Osmos:** Microsoft acquires Osmos to enhance Fabric with agentic AI-driven data engineering, aiming to streamline data workflows and automate pipelines within OneLake.

## Fabric Platform

- **AI Auto-Summary for Semantic Models:** Preview feature leveraging AI to generate summaries of semantic models, aiding faster understanding and navigation in OneLake Catalog.
- **Parent-Child Hierarchy in OneLake Catalog:** Improved data organization for better traceability and management.
- **Item Reference Variable Type (Preview):** New structured variable type improves security, maintainability, and CI/CD readiness across Fabric items, ensuring reliable configuration referencing.
- **Enhanced GitHub Integration:** Native support for GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency and standalone branch commits, facilitating CI/CD and development workflows.
- **Python SDK for Fabric REST API:** Preview release empowers automation, resource management, and integration with Fabric through Python, supporting credential management and workspace operations.

## OneLake

- **Granular Security Role APIs (Preview):** Fine-grained REST APIs for managing OneLake roles, supporting programmatic security governance and automation in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Mirrored Item Security:** Apply granular security controls (table, row, column-level) on mirrored data, ensuring compliance and secure data sharing.
- **Immutable Diagnostic Logs:** Enforce immutability of diagnostic logs for compliance and auditing.

## Data Engineering

- **High Concurrency for Lakehouse:** Optimized Spark session sharing enables faster concurrent operations for Lakehouse workloads, enhancing cost and performance.
- **Notebook Enhancements:** Create and manage Fabric connections within Notebooks, use secured connections to cloud sources, generate code snippets, and leverage built-in authentication flows.
- **VS Code Integration:** Open and edit Fabric notebooks directly in VS Code, synchronize changes with remote workspaces, and manage multiple notebooks/workspaces in one view.
- **Materialized Lake View Enhancements:** Support for 'create or replace' semantics and improved lineage tracking to streamline iteration and troubleshooting.

## Data Warehouse

- **Proactive and Incremental Statistics Refresh:** Automated and faster management of column statistics, reducing query planning times and manual intervention.
- **Result Set Caching:** Now generally available, accelerates repeated queries.
- **MERGE (Transact-SQL):** Integrated single statement for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.

## Real-Time Intelligence

- **Private Network Streaming Sources:** Eventstream now supports streaming data from virtual networks/on-premises with secure Azure managed VNet bridging.
- **MQTT v3 Support:** Extended protocol support for IoT integration.
- **Weather Data Connector:** New, production-ready connector for real-time weather ingest and analytics.
- **Eventhouse Shortcuts:** Improvements including datetime-based acceleration, freshness control, and simplified KQL syntax.
- **Copilot Integration:** Copilot now assists in querying Eventhouse shortcuts with autogenerated KQL.

## Data Factory

- **Broadened Incremental Copy Support:** New connectors added for Copy Job, improving multi-cloud and on-premises integration workflows.

## Security Highlights

- **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Expanded API control over OneLake roles, mirrored item security, and immutable logs enhance governance.
- **Secure Connections:** New variable types and authentication mechanisms safeguard configuration across Data Engineering and Notebooks.
