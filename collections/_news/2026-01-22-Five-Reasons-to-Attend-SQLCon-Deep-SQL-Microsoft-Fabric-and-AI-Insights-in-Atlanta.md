# Five Reasons to Attend SQLCon: Deep SQL, Microsoft Fabric, and AI Insights in Atlanta

The SQL community is coming together in March for the inaugural [SQLCon](https://sqlcon.us/) in Atlanta, held alongside [FabCon](https://sqlcon.us/fabcon/), the Microsoft Fabric Community Conference, from March 16-20.

## 1. Double the Value with One Registration

A single registration grants access to both SQLCon and FabCon, enabling attendees to explore in-depth SQL topics as well as sessions on Microsoft Fabric, Power BI, real-time intelligence, and AI. This setup benefits DBAs, developers, data engineers, architects, and leaders working on data-driven teams who want to bridge expertise across the Microsoft data platform.

## 2. Hands-On Workshops and Technical Sessions

With [50 technical sessions](https://sqlcon.us/program/tracks) on offer, the program emphasizes momentum and practical learning. Sessions will cover:

- SQL Server
- Azure SQL
- SQL in Microsoft Fabric
- Performance tuning
- Security and governance
- Database migration and modernization
- Building AI-powered SQL experiences

Workshops (Monday and Tuesday) are hands-on, where you can use your own laptop to practice using scripts, patterns, and demos for immediate application. The rest of the week focuses on building your annual technical plan.

## 3. Prime Location: Atlanta's Downtown and Community Experience

The Georgia World Congress Center provides a walkable, vibrant setting. Networking extends beyond the sessions, with the attendee party held at the Georgia Aquarium, facilitating informal exchanges with peers and product teams in a unique environment.

## 4. Live Engineering Announcements and Future Roadmap

Get firsthand updates from Microsoft’s SQL product team (with over 30 engineers onsite):

- Roadmap presentations for SQL Server, Azure SQL, and SQL in Fabric
- Live demos covering SQL tooling, SSMS/VS Code extensions, Copilot integrations
- Insights into future capabilities that will impact your data estate

## 5. Community Engagement and Expert Access

Meet MVPs and Microsoft product teams during dedicated Ask-the-Experts sessions, networking events, and meetups. Shared keynotes and real-world technical discussions help practitioners tackle their toughest challenges and build valuable connections.

## Bonus: Special Offers and Registration Discounts

Look out for early-bird pricing, team discounts, and current promo codes (e.g., **SQLCMTY200** for $200 off). These deals are available for a limited time and offer additional value for attendees and teams.

## Summary

SQLCon + FabCon provides a concentrated week to advance your skills in SQL technologies, Microsoft Fabric, and AI-powered data solutions.
