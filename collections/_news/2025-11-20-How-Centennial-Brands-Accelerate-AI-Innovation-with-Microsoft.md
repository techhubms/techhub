This article highlights how household names with more than a century of legacy are achieving radical results through partnership with Microsoft and its cutting-edge AI ecosystem.

## The Kraft Heinz Company: Preserving Institutional Wisdom with Azure AI

Kraft Heinz is digitizing decades of manufacturing expertise using 'The Cookbook,' an AI agent built on Microsoft Azure OpenAI and a proprietary database. Employees use this tool to query historical production data, optimize ketchup quality, and refine manufacturing processes.

- **Azure OpenAI Service** links historical production data with actionable insights.
- **Proprietary AI agent (The Cookbook)** digitizes expertise for consistent quality.
- Joint efforts with Microsoft include a Supply Chain Control Tower and digital twins for virtual process testing.

## Wells Fargo: Data-Driven Decision-Making at Scale

With over 30,000 employees actively using Microsoft 365 and Copilot products, Wells Fargo demonstrates significant adoption of enterprise AI. The bank transitioned to Microsoft Azure as its primary cloud provider, supporting improved analytics and compliance management. Generative and agentic AI capabilities in GitHub and Microsoft Copilot support client interaction and internal processes, enhancing efficiency and security in a highly regulated environment.

- **Analytics and cloud migration** to Azure drive technology choices.

## Levi Strauss & Co.: Performance and Integrity with AI-Powered Agents

In retail, Levi Strauss & Co. has implemented AI-powered agents and integrated digital tools via Azure. A multi-year digital transformation improved workflow, data quality, and security, laying the groundwork for agentic AI. The latest 'superagent' empowers employees with intuitive, prompt-driven insights, aiding decision-making and customer engagement as the company shifts toward direct-to-consumer operations.

- **Azure migration** enables scalable AI deployment.
- **Custom AI agents** augment employee performance and creativity.
- Focused on both efficiency and ethical decision-making.

## Land O’Lakes: Making Agronomists Heroes with AI Assistants

This cooperative transformed its IT landscape by migrating to Azure, adopting Microsoft Copilot, and fine-tuning its own enterprise digital assistant, 'Oz.' Oz draws from decades of agronomic data to help retail agronomists provide data-informed, customized guidance to farmers, enhancing yield outcomes and risk management.

- **Digital assistant (Oz)** surfaces deep agricultural insights through Microsoft AI.
- Migrating the IT environment to Azure forms the infrastructure for scalable innovation.
