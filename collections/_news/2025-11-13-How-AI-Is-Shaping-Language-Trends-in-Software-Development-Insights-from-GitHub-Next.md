# How AI Is Shaping Language Trends in Software Development: Insights from GitHub Next

**Author:** Alexandra Lietzke

In this interview, Idan Gazit, the leader behind GitHub Next—the R&D group responsible for innovations like Copilot—discusses how artificial intelligence is not just speeding up coding but fundamentally changing the decision-making process before a developer writes their first line.

## The AI Feedback Loop

- **AI’s influence extends deeper than code completion.** Gazit argues that AI is prompting developers to rethink their choice of language and frameworks.
- TypeScript has surged as the most-used language on GitHub in 2025, surpassing Python and JavaScript, as documented in the latest Octoverse report.
- The reason isn’t simply popularity; it’s that typed languages like TypeScript offer the structure AI tools can leverage for safer, more reliable code generation.

> If an AI tool is going to generate code for me, I want a fast way to know whether that code is correct. Explicit types give me that safety net.

> —Idan Gazit

## Language Choice and AI Compatibility

- **Typed languages are rising** because they help AI tools reduce hallucination and provide developers with more reliable output and validation.
- Developers are now considering how well AI tools support a language when starting a project, shifting language adoption from personal or cultural preference to AI-compatibility.
- AI tools, trained on massive datasets, naturally excel at generating code in mainstream languages (TypeScript, Python, Java).

## "Duct Tape" Languages and the Drudgery Layer

- AI relieves much of the pain associated with scripting languages like Bash, which experienced a 206% year-over-year growth in AI-generated projects.
- Developers can now lean on AI to quickly produce boilerplate or less enjoyable code, choosing the best tool for the job without being restricted by manual effort.

## Enterprise Adoption and Developer Roles

- AI adoption is accelerating across enterprises, with tangible benefits for onboarding junior developers and shifting senior developer roles from writing complex code to guiding architecture and code validation.
- Key changes include:
  - Greater focus on architectural skills rather than just code volume
  - Increased leverage of tooling in shaping what AI can automate
  - The rise of typed languages to enable more automation

## The Rise of WebAssembly (WASM) and Future Interoperability

- WebAssembly is gradually erasing runtime fragmentation, enabling code written in different languages to run anywhere.
- Combined with AI-generated code and WASM targeting, developers will focus less on syntax and more on ecosystem, tooling, and interoperability.

## Key Takeaways for Developers

- The primary lesson isn't to switch to a specific language, but to optimize for languages and tools that offer the most leverage through both ecosystem maturity and effective AI support.
- Developer success will be measured by how well they can combine their skills with the new opportunities created by AI and interoperability platforms like WASM.
