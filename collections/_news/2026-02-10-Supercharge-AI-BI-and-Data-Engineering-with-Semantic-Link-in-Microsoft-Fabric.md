Microsoft Fabric Blog explores how Semantic Link, now generally available in Microsoft Fabric, empowers data teams by unifying AI, BI, and data engineering with a collaborative semantic layer.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Supercharge AI, BI, and Data Engineering with Semantic Link in Microsoft Fabric

Great technology is not defined by design alone—it must enable real-world problem solving. Semantic Link in Microsoft Fabric is a transformative capability that unifies AI, BI, and data engineering via a collaborative semantic layer, making it possible for teams to work faster on trusted data.

## From Concept to Multi-Persona Capability

Semantic Link began as a way for data scientists to interact directly with semantic models in notebooks and has since evolved into a cross-Fabric tool for data scientists, BI engineers, data engineers, and administrators.

## Accelerating Data Science

- Connect to semantic models directly from notebooks
- Run advanced analytics and predictions
- Write enriched results back to OneLake, instantly updating downstream Power BI reports
- [Watch the demo: Semantic Link for data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F59zX6y2MqA)

## Automating Power BI Tasks

- Programmatic augmentation of semantic models
- Data quality validation
- Model and report translation
- Migration across environments or capacities
- [Watch the demo: Semantic Link for Power BI automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6fmElJ3LE8)

## Streamlining Data Engineering

- Automate SQL and Spark tasks
- Optimize Lakehouse tables
- Assess Fabric resources efficiently
- Reduce operational overhead and increase reliability
- [Watch the demo: Semantic Link for data engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YapQbuFUUNY)

## Community-Driven Evolution

- Community innovation via [Semantic Link Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs)
- Contributions from experts such as Michael Kowalsky
- Expansion with [Spark Runtime 2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/runtime-2-0) and [Sempy 0.13.0](https://pypi.org/project/semantic-link/0.13.0/#description)
- Supports SPN-based automation, report cloning, model translation, and Lakehouse optimization

## Get Involved

- Learn more via the [Semantic Link Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/semantic-link-overview)
- Submit feature requests or contribute to [Semantic Link Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-link-labs)
- Vote on which lab capabilities should become core

Semantic Link stands as a foundational component for data modeling, automation, and operationalization within Microsoft Fabric. Its community-led development invites practitioners to experiment and help shape the future of data collaboration.
