# What AI coding tools are actually good for, according to developers

**By Cassidy Williams**

AI in software development is not about replacing expert coders—it's about letting them achieve flow and focus on what matters most. Drawing on developer feedback, live streams, and real-world interviews, this article explores:

## Developer Feedback Shapes AI Tools

- Developers want tools that fit into their workflow, not disruptive automation.
- GitHub tests AI code assistants directly in editors and terminals—where devs feel at home.
- Fine-grained controls let users decide when and how suggestions appear.

## Chat Interface: Power & Pitfalls

- Context-switching to chat can interrupt coding flow.
- Chat is best for on-demand help (explanations, framework queries), not as the main interface.
- Developers should feel free to minimize chat or use it only as needed.

> *"It’s a huge burden to switch to a chat just to interact with AI." – Dalia Abo Sheasha, Visual Studio PM*

## Empowerment, Not Replacement

- The most valued AI features help automate repetitive tasks (scaffolding, boilerplate, documentation), not architectural decision-making or debugging tricky business logic.
- Experienced developers change habits incrementally, while beginners learn new workflows altogether.
- AI-generated explanations work as learning aids, not as a substitute for understanding.

## AI Suggestions Should Blend In

- Valuable AI experiences surface contextually and non-intrusively (e.g., intelligent renames, in-place completions).
- Customization of frequency/aggressiveness is key to maintaining comfort and productivity.

## Centering the Human Developer

- The human is always at the heart of the software process.
- AI's role: enable creativity, remove drudgery, and improve documentation/testing.
- Ultimate control and creative insight remain with the developer.

## Honest Feedback Fuels Progress

- Not every AI feature lands well—developers can and do disable intrusive or unhelpful suggestions.
- Direct feedback (beta/issue threads, community forums) steers product roadmaps.
- Telemetry and user reports help teams quickly iterate and improve.

## Practical Tips for AI-Driven Coding

- **Always review code you accept.**
- **Use explanations as a study tool, not a crutch.**
- **Adjust AI behaviors to fit your workflow.**
- **Give clear feedback—teams listen!**

## In Summary

AI coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot can be transformative if—and only if—they are shaped by developers' real needs and honest, ongoing feedback. The goal is empowerment, not replacement. Your insights, preferences, and standards drive progress in tool usability and value.
