# Empowering Defenders in the Era of Agentic AI with Microsoft Sentinel

## Introduction

Microsoft announces new security capabilities in Microsoft Sentinel, marking a transition to agentic AI for organizational defense at scale. This innovation empowers defenders with AI-driven context, automation, and extensibility, emphasizing the growing collaboration between humans and AI agents in security operations.

## Microsoft Sentinel in the Agentic Era

- **Microsoft Sentinel** is evolving from a cloud-native SIEM to an agentic platform, now including a unified security data lake, graph-based context, and extensibility through public previews like Sentinel graph and MCP server.
- Sentinal enables defenders to unify signals, correlate data across domains, and empower AI agents, including those built directly in Security Copilot, VS Code with GitHub Copilot, or custom development platforms.
- Rich contextual insights are built through vectorized security data and graph relationships, with integrations into Microsoft Defender and Purview, allowing for improved attack path tracing and incident prioritization.
- Sentinel’s approach unifies security data, scales automation, and supports open extensibility through the Microsoft Security Store, allowing partners to create and deploy their own agents.

## Security Copilot: Build Your Own Agents

- **Security Copilot** assists security teams with challenges like alert overload and tool fragmentation by enabling users to create custom agents with a no-code builder or via coding platforms (e.g., VS Code, GitHub Copilot).
- These agents integrate into workflows and daily tools, including baked-in Microsoft security products, partner, and custom solutions.
- More than a dozen Security Copilot agents are available for scenarios including phishing triage and conditional access optimization, with continued expansion and availability through the Security Store.
- Built with Sentinel’s graph-based context, Copilot agents orchestrate and automate routine tasks, enabling more efficient triage, investigation, and reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR).

## Securing & Governing AI

- Microsoft is enhancing **Security for AI** with tools for agent discovery and management (Entra Agent ID), controls to prevent data oversharing in AI agents, risk discovery tools for MCP servers, and detection for advanced AI-specific threats such as prompt injection.
- Azure AI Foundry sees new controls for agent task adherence, PII protection, and prompt shielding, securing the AI lifecycle.
- These improvements help secure AI use across platforms like Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio, and Azure AI Foundry, offering stronger guardrails and governance.

## Upcoming Events

- Announcements invite security professionals to engage in upcoming Microsoft Secure and Ignite events for hands-on demos and deeper dives into these innovations.

## Vision

- The post underscores the philosophy that security is an adaptive, team-based endeavor, leveraging AI and human intelligence together for proactive, intelligent defense.
