# Gemini 3.1 Pro Public Preview in GitHub Copilot

Gemini 3.1 Pro, Google’s latest agentic coding model, is now available to users of GitHub Copilot. Early tests indicate that Gemini 3.1 Pro excels in effective and efficient edit-then-test loops, demonstrating high tool precision and requiring fewer tool calls to complete tasks during benchmarks.

## Availability

Gemini 3.1 Pro is available to the following Copilot plans:

- Copilot Pro
- Copilot Pro+
- Copilot Business
- Copilot Enterprise

Users can select Gemini 3.1 Pro from the model picker in:

- Visual Studio Code (all modes: chat, ask, edit, agent)
- Visual Studio (all modes: agent, ask)
- github.com
- GitHub Mobile (iOS and Android)

Rollout is gradual, so users may need to check back if the new model is not yet visible.

## Enabling Access for Organizations

Administrators of Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Business plans must enable the Gemini 3.1 Pro policy in Copilot settings to make the model available to users within those organizations.
