# Driving ROI with Azure AI Foundry and UiPath: Intelligent Agents in Healthcare Workflows

*Author: Marco Casalaina*

Organizations are increasingly moving from AI experimentation to real-world operationalization. Microsoft, in partnership with UiPath, brings together automation and AI at scale, especially in healthcare workflows that impact patient care.

## AI-Driven Automation in Healthcare

By integrating Azure AI Foundry and UiPath, healthcare organizations can:

- Improve operational efficiency
- Reduce manual workloads
- Lower costs and risk
- Achieve tangible ROI from AI investments

### Real-World Example: Managing Incidental Findings in Radiology

Incidental findings in radiology reports—unexpected abnormalities in CT, MRI, or other imaging studies—often go overlooked due to the growing volume of patient data. This combination of Azure AI Foundry and UiPath automates:

1. **Generation of radiology reports** — finalized in core systems
2. **Review by UiPath medical record summarization (MRS) agents** — flags incidental findings
3. **Analysis by Azure AI Foundry imaging agents** — compares historical data and images
4. **Aggregation by UiPath agents** — brings together EMR history, imaging, and AI insights for a comprehensive follow-up report
5. **Delivery** — condensed, relevant reports put in clinicians’ hands for prompt follow-up
6. **Process orchestration by UiPath Maestro™** — routes reports to the appropriate physician for action

This workflow results in:

- Automated data extraction and summarization
- Improved speed and consistency in identifying follow-ups
- Efficient, compliant AI-powered clinical documentation

### Technical Components

- **UiPath Maestro™** orchestrates multiple agents and integrates natively with Azure AI Foundry for traceability and secure automation
- **UiPath Agents** extract structured and unstructured data from EMR, reports, and historic records
- **Azure AI Foundry Agents** analyze imaging data and provide AI diagnostic insights, leveraging APIs like DICOMweb and FHIR for secure healthcare data handling

### Broader Benefits and Customer Feedback

Organizations adopting these technologies report:

- Faster detection of patient risks and better care delivery
- Lower administrative burden on clinicians
- Cost savings through early detection
- Built-in trust and compliance with healthcare data standards

> *"AI-powered automation is redefining how healthcare operates. Partnering with Microsoft and UiPath allows us to transcend data silos and create intelligent workflows that truly serve patients." - Robin Spraul, Mercy*

> *"With UiPath Maestro and Azure AI Foundry working together, we’re helping enterprises operationalize AI in essential workflows." - Asha Sharma, Microsoft*

> *"UiPath and Microsoft enable organizations to bring automation and AI into real-world business processes, not just in healthcare, but across all industries." - Graham Sheldon, UiPath*

### Looking Forward

Healthcare is just the start: the Azure AI Foundry and UiPath partnership extends to industries like finance, supply chain, and customer service. By embedding AI into automated workflows, enterprises can scale operational AI using trusted, enterprise-grade tools.
