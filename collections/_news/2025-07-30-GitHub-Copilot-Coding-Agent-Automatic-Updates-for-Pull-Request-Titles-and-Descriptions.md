## GitHub Copilot Coding Agent: Keeping Pull Request Titles and Bodies Up to Date

**Author:** Allison

The latest update to the [GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent) streamlines teamwork and review in coding workflows. With this enhancement, you can now delegate tasks to Copilot, which will handle them in the background.

### How It Works

- **Delegation and Automation:** Assign a coding task to the Copilot coding agent. Copilot automatically creates a pull request (PR) as it commences work.
- **Review Process:** When Copilot finishes, it tags you for review. If you have changes or feedback, simply leave comments directly on the PR.
- **Automatic PR Updates:** As Copilot addresses your feedback and updates the code, it will now also update the PR's title and body. This provides an at-a-glance summary and ensures you always have a clear view of what has changed. This reduces manual overhead and keeps your team's collaboration seamless.

### Availability

- **Public Preview:** This feature is in public preview for users with Copilot Pro or Copilot Pro+.
- **Business and Enterprise:** Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise users can access this feature if an administrator enables the relevant policy.

### Learn More

- For details and setup instructions, see the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent).

### Summary

This update enhances Copilot's utility in collaborative development environments, improving the clarity and accuracy of pull requests by keeping descriptions current as feedback is incorporated.
