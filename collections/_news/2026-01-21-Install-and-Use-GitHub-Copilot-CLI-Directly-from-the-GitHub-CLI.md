# Install and Use GitHub Copilot CLI Directly from the GitHub CLI

Developers who use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) can now easily install and run the GitHub Copilot CLI by executing `gh copilot`.

## Key Features

- **Simple Installation**: When you run `gh copilot` for the first time, it will prompt you to install the Copilot CLI.
- **Unified Experience**: After installation, `gh copilot` forwards any unsupported arguments or flags to the Copilot CLI, offering a seamless experience.
- **Deprecation Notice**: The previous 'GitHub Copilot in the CLI' extension is now deprecated in favor of the new Copilot CLI, which offers enhanced, agentic AI assistant capabilities in the terminal.

## Getting Started

1. **Install or Update GitHub CLI**: Make sure your GitHub CLI is up to date. [Installation instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) are available on GitHub.
2. **Run 'gh copilot'**: Launch your terminal and execute:

   ```
   gh copilot
   ```

   - The CLI will guide you through installing Copilot CLI if it isn’t already installed.
   - Subsequent uses will run the Copilot CLI with your provided arguments.
3. **Read Release Notes**: For more details on integration and usage, check out the [GitHub CLI’s release notes](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases).

## Additional Resources

- [GitHub Copilot CLI on GitHub](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)
- [GitHub CLI documentation](https://cli.github.com/)

These updates are intended to improve the developer experience by providing a powerful AI coding assistant accessible directly from the command line.
