Dan Hellem presents a practical update for Azure DevOps users: the introduction of condensed views on Kanban and Sprint boards. This feature enhances board usability for teams working with large backlogs.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Introducing Condensed Views for Kanban and Sprint Boards in Azure DevOps

**Author:** Dan Hellem  

One common challenge for teams using Azure DevOps Boards is handling large Kanban or Sprint boards—especially when work item cards contain many fields or tags. The new Boards hub, launched to boost readability, introduced extra spacing and padding. While this made cards clearer, it also reduced the number of items visible at a glance.

To address this, Azure DevOps now offers a *condensed view* toggle for both Kanban and Sprint boards:

- **Standard vs. Condensed:** Toggle between the regular card layout (showing full details) and a condensed option that displays only the work item title.
- **Benefits:**
  - See more cards on the board simultaneously
  - Improve backlog scanning and triage processes
  - Reduce vertical space consumption, especially for cards with multiple tags or custom fields
- **How it works:**
  - The toggle is available directly on board pages
  - Switch between full info and title-only layouts instantly, adapting to your workflow
  - Mirrors the previous condensed experience in Delivery Plans

#### Example Screenshots

*(Images in the original announcement show the difference: large cards with many details vs. a much slimmer display when condensed view is enabled.)*

#### Rollout Information

- The feature is included in the current Azure DevOps release
- Rollout is expected to reach all organizations by early March
