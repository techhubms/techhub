# Fast Mode for Claude Opus 4.6 Now Available in GitHub Copilot Preview

Fast mode for Claude Opus 4.6 is currently rolling out as a research preview in GitHub Copilot. This high-speed mode delivers output token speeds up to 2.5 times faster while maintaining the same intelligence as the standard Opus 4.6 model. The release is experimental and focuses on enhancing inference speed for improved developer productivity.

## Availability

- **Access:** Initially available to Copilot Enterprise users.
- **Environments:** Model selection is possible via the model picker in Visual Studio Code (across all modes: chat, ask, edit, agent) and in the Copilot CLI tool.
- **Rollout:** Feature will be introduced gradually.

## Enabling Fast Mode

- Copilot Enterprise administrators must enable Fast mode for Claude Opus 4.6 within Copilot settings to provide access to their teams.
