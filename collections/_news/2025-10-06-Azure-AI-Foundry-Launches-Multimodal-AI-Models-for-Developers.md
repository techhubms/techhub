# Azure AI Foundry Launches Multimodal AI Models for Developers

Azure AI Foundry takes center stage at OpenAI DevDay with the release of cutting-edge tools and models that enable developers to build, experiment, and scale state-of-the-art AI applications across text, images, audio, and video domains.

## New OpenAI Models in Azure AI Foundry

- **GPT-image-1-mini:** Optimized for efficient, high-quality text-to-image and image-to-image generation, designed to perform at scale with minimal compute overhead. Use cases include educational material generation, storybook design, game asset prototyping, and UI workflow acceleration.
- **GPT-realtime-mini & GPT-audio-mini:** Provide fast, cost-effective solutions for real-time voice interaction, translation, and audio content generation while running on lightweight infrastructure—ideal for chatbots, assistants, and media applications.
- **GPT-5-chat-latest:** Enhanced with improved safety guardrails to better protect users during sensitive interactions, offering robust detection of potentially distressing dialogue.
- **GPT-5-pro:** Delivers advanced reasoning and analytics capabilities, leveraging tournament-style reasoning pathways for accuracy, making it suitable for complex analytics, code generation, and business-critical decision-making tasks.

## Developer-Centric Platform Updates

Azure AI Foundry is committed to helping developers build multimodal solutions quickly and economically. The platform not only integrates the latest models but also introduces:

- **Microsoft Agent Framework**: An open-source SDK and runtime for orchestrating multi-agent AI systems, blending Semantic Kernel's business-oriented tools with AutoGen's dynamic agent capabilities. This framework allows scalable, intelligent, agentic AI system construction directly on Azure.
- **Multi-agent workflows, unified observability, Voice Live API GA,** and **Responsible AI features** to simplify development and ensure safety, traceability, and compliance.

## Pricing, Availability, and Future Roadmap

- The newly announced OpenAI models are rolling out into Azure AI Foundry, with broad availability from October 7, 2025.
- Pricing tables and deployment details are available through Azure (referenced within the article).
- Looking ahead, Azure AI Foundry will soon launch **Sora 2**, which brings advanced video and audio generation in a single API, enabling even richer, synchronized, and physics-driven generative media experiences.

## Key Takeaways

- Developers can leverage these new capabilities to create multimodal AI workflows that bring together text, images, audio, and video.
- Models are optimized for cost-efficiency and real-time performance, supporting rapid innovation in education, gaming, enterprise automation, and more.
- Microsoft reaffirms its emphasis on responsible AI with safety and observability baked into core offerings.
