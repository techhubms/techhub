# Safer Internet Day 2026: Empowering Students to Be AI-Aware and Safe Online

Safer Internet Day 2026 spotlights the importance of making students AI-aware, safe, and confident in the digital world, with support from a range of Microsoft Education initiatives.

## Why AI Awareness and Safety Matter

Today’s learners interact constantly with AI-powered platforms, making digital literacy and critical thinking essential. This year’s theme—*AI Aware: Safe, Smart, In Control*—emphasizes helping students:

- Assess and understand AI-driven content
- Recognize manipulative online interactions and misinformation
- Protect their digital identities and personal data
- Engage online with curiosity, discernment, and confidence

Educators and families are encouraged to foster these skills as part of digital citizenship education.

## Microsoft Education Security Toolkit

To support safer learning environments, the new [Microsoft Education Security Toolkit](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-microsoft-education-security-toolkit.html?lcid=EN-US) provides practical, education-focused resources:

- Security frameworks based on [Zero Trust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview)
- AI-powered security tools and guidance for institutions of any size
- Data governance for AI, analytics, and research
- Materials for student-led Security Operations Centers and cybersecurity learning
- Real-world case studies from global education leaders

This toolkit emphasizes that strong cybersecurity is a foundation for safe AI adoption, innovation, and resilient digital ecosystems in education.

## Minecraft Education’s CyberSafe Series

Digital safety learning can begin early, and [Minecraft Education's CyberSafe series](https://education.minecraft.net/discover/cyber-and-digital-safety) offers immersive, age-appropriate experiences for students ages 8–14. Highlights include:

- Scenario-based lessons on evaluating digital risks and identifying suspicious online behavior
- The *Bad Connection?* module for ages 11–14, providing a safe environment for practicing responses to manipulative interactions and peer pressure
- Alignment with national and international standards (CSTA, Cyber.org)
- Free resources and online training for educators and families

## Practical Steps for Schools and Communities

Safer Internet Day highlights the role of every member of the school community. Microsoft Education offers:

- [K–12 Cybersecurity Infographic](https://aka.ms/EDUK12CyberInfographic): Visual guides to spotting digital threats

**Action points:**

- Use these resources for classroom discussions, staff development, and family engagement
- Incorporate digital safety and AI literacy into schoolwide initiatives

## Conclusion

By strengthening AI literacy and cybersecurity practices, educational institutions can empower students to navigate AI-powered digital spaces with security, curiosity, and confidence.
