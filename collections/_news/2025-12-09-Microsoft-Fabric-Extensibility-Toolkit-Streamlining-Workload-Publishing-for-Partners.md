# Microsoft Fabric Extensibility Toolkit: Updates for Efficient Workload Publishing

The Microsoft Fabric team has announced pivotal updates to the Fabric Extensibility Toolkit (FET), presenting partners and organizations with improved pathways to deliver innovative workloads for the Fabric platform.

## Key Highlights

- **Partner Workloads Now in the Workload Hub:**
  - Partners can now use the Fabric Extensibility Toolkit to publish workloads directly to the Fabric Workload Hub.
  - Customers gain streamlined discovery, installation, and usage, matching the experience of native Fabric workloads.
  - Unified integration supports a consistent and cohesive Fabric ecosystem.

- **Validation Documentation for Partners:**
  - Extensive guidelines provide a checklist of test cases and validation criteria for preparing workloads.
  - Includes links to supplementary resources, best practices, styling components advice, and an attestation template for transparency.
  - Ensures reliability, quality, and a native user experience for partner solutions.

- **Validation Tool for Workload Testing (Preview):**
  - A dedicated tool allows partners to test workloads against all formal validation criteria.
  - Repository available for cloning: [Github Validator Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-extensibility-toolkit-validator)
  - Streamlines the publishing process and strengthens customer confidence.
  - Ensures consistency by aligning documentation with actual validation frameworks used in the Toolkit.
