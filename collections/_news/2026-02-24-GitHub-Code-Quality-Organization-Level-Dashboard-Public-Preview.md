- **User-Based Permissions:**
  - Organization owners and administrators can see information for all repositories.
  - Developers can see results for repositories where they have `write` access.
- **Sorting and Filtering:** Users can sort and filter repositories by key quality attributes to identify which repositories may need further attention.
- **Availability:**
  - Available in public preview on github.com to organizations enrolled in GitHub Code Quality.
  - Supported in GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency features.
