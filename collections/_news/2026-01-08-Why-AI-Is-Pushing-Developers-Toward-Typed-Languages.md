# Why AI Is Pushing Developers Toward Typed Languages

Cassidy Williams examines how the rise of AI-assisted coding tools is influencing developers' choice between typed and untyped languages. As more code is produced by AI, type systems are increasingly acting as critical safety nets in software projects.

## The Shift: Typed vs. Untyped

Dynamic languages like Python and JavaScript offer speed and flexibility, but they lack the security provided by type systems. Typed languages, on the other hand, support reliability, especially important when AI tools generate code that developers may not have reviewed line by line.

## Type Systems as Safety Nets

Type systems catch ambiguous logic and enforce contracts between code components, including those generated by AI. As AI and agent-based tools produce increasing portions of project scaffolding and boilerplate, the structured safeguards provided by types become essential.

## AI's Impact on Compilation Errors

A recent 2025 study highlighted that 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were related to type-check failures, showcasing the tangible reliability gains from using typed languages.

## Octoverse 2025: A Data-Driven Trend

The Octoverse 2025 report confirms TypeScript's ascent as the most popular language on GitHub, surpassing both Python and JavaScript in contributor numbers. The growth was partially fueled by frameworks and by the fact that typed languages help AI slot code safely into existing projects.

Other typed languages such as Luau, Typst, Java, C++, and C# are also gaining traction. Gradual and optional typing systems attract developers seeking varying degrees of safety and flexibility for AI-generated automation.

## Looking Forward

The rise of type systems doesn't spell the end of dynamic languages; instead, it marks the increasing importance of safety in AI-assisted development. Static types now form a trustable backbone for developers working with AI-generated code.

For more information, readers are encouraged to check out the latest Octoverse report and experiment with tools like Copilot CLI.
