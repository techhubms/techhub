# Hierarchy View for GitHub Projects Launches in Public Preview

GitHub has released the long-anticipated **hierarchy view** for GitHub Projects, now available in public preview. This new feature allows users to see the full nesting of sub-issues directly within project table views, making it easier to break down and manage complex work without leaving context or switching interfaces.

## What is Hierarchy View?

With hierarchy view enabled, users can:

- Expand and collapse sub-issues up to eight levels deep.
- Group, slice, sort, and filter issues while preserving the hierarchical structure.
- View and quickly add existing sub-issues that aren’t yet present in the project.

To get started, open the **View** menu in a project and enable **Show hierarchy**.

## Upcoming Features

GitHub is continuing development on hierarchy view, with planned enhancements including:

- Inline creation and addition of sub-issues directly from a project table.
- Drag-and-drop reordering and reparenting of sub-issues.
- Synchronized ordering between sub-issue lists in issues and projects.

## Community Feedback

Users are encouraged to share feedback through the [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/184225) or via the project options menu in GitHub Projects.

## Additional Enhancements

- **Performance Improvements:** The team delivered an initial update improving issues load times—raising instantly loading issues from 2% to 12%, with a benchmark under 200ms.
- **Project Display:** The new **View** menu in Projects simplifies display option management.
- **REST API:** A new [API endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/projects/views?apiVersion=2022-11-28) lets users create project views programmatically.
- **Merge Queue Updates:** Pull request merge queue states are now visible inside projects.
- **Linking Improvements:** It's now easier to link pull requests to issues using URLs from the 'Development' section.
