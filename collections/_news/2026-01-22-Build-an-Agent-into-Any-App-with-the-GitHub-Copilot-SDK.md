# Build an Agent into Any App with the GitHub Copilot SDK

**Author: Mario Rodriguez**

The new GitHub Copilot SDK, now in technical preview, allows developers to embed Copilot's agentic workflows and tools directly into any application. This SDK brings the same core execution loop that powers the GitHub Copilot CLI, enabling programmatic access to AI-powered planning, tool invocation, file modifications, and command execution from within your codebase.

## Key Features of the Copilot SDK

- **Agentic Execution Loop**: Utilize the production-tested planner, tool loop, and multi-turn runtime from Copilot CLI within your own applications.
- **Tool Orchestration**: Integrate custom tools, define commands, and manage context across turns without manual wiring.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Route between multiple AI models as appropriate for each workflow step.
- **MCP Server Integration**: Leverage Copilot's internal server architecture for authentication and command execution.
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Access responses and status updates in real time for dynamic interfaces.
- **Custom Agents and Skills**: Build specialized agents, embed them in GUIs, games, summarizers, or automation tools.
- **Authentication and Security**: Use GitHub authentication to control access and maintain proper safety boundaries.

## How Does The SDK Expand on Copilot CLI?

The SDK generalizes Copilot CLI's agentic workflows so they can be embedded into any programming language or application environment. It supports advanced features like persistent memory, infinite sessions, and intelligent context compaction. The SDK enables:

- Embedding Copilot in GUIs or desktop apps
- Creating workflow automation (e.g., speech-to-command)
- Building internal tools for enterprises with agentic AI logic
- Extending productivity with tools like YouTube chapter generators, summarizers, or custom games

## Use Case Examples

- Build custom UIs for your AI agents
- Integrate real-time AI-powered features into existing applications
- Run background automation using Copilot's execution platform
- Delegate complex tasks to Copilot-powered custom agents and skills

## Getting Started

You can start building today by [visiting the SDK repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk?utm_source=blog-cli-sdk-repo-cta&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=cli-sdk-jan-2026). The SDK includes documentation, examples, and details on current features offered in the technical preview.

## Summary

The GitHub Copilot SDK lowers the barrier for embedding advanced AI and agentic workflows into any software project, leveraging the battle-tested systems from the Copilot CLI and providing strong integration points for authentication, tool orchestration, and multi-model selection.
