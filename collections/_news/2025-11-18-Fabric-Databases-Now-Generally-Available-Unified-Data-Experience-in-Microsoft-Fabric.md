# Fabric Databases—A Unified, SaaS-Native Experience for Modern Data Workloads

Microsoft has announced the general availability of Fabric databases within Microsoft Fabric, delivering a unified data platform that merges SQL database and Cosmos DB technologies. This launch aims to simplify how organizations manage, analyze, and activate their data, supporting the next generation of AI-powered applications.

## Key Features of Fabric Databases

- **Unified Architecture:** Combines operational and analytical data (structured and unstructured) in one platform.
- **AI Optimization:** Native integration with Microsoft AI services, supporting vector data and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns.
- **Autonomous, Serverless Experience:** Fast provisioning, minimal configuration, enterprise-grade security, and unified billing.
- **Developer-Focused Tools:** Integration with VS Code, GitHub, GraphQL APIs, and User Data Functions.
- **Seamless Data Access:** Real-time querying of operational data from SQL database or Cosmos DB without complex ETL pipelines. OneLake provides analytics-ready, synchronized data views.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Modern App Development

Organizations like Eastman leverage Fabric databases for agentic applications, integrating SQL database in Fabric, Azure Web Apps, and Azure OpenAI Service. Users interact via natural language; the system translates queries into SQL for instant, precise insights using vector search and filtering.

### Reverse ETL for Actionable Data

Fabric enables real-time analytics pushback into operational systems (CRM, ERP, personalization services). High concurrency and low latency are achieved using OLTP-optimized SQL DB and scalable Cosmos DB, transforming analytics from passive dashboards to instant business actions. Eastman cut data prep times by integrating OneLake shortcuts and pipelines that use AI for data enrichment.

E-commerce platforms use Cosmos DB in Fabric for <200ms latency recommendations, while companies like Kinectify capitalize on zero-ETL movement between Cosmos DB and OneLake for compliance and anomaly detection.

### Translytical Task Flows

Fabric supports "translytical" operations—mixing transactional speed and analytical scale—including Power BI write-back. AP Pension and Kinectify report improved operational efficiency, data governance, and anomaly detection by integrating Power BI visuals with SQL and Cosmos DB in Fabric.

## Database Types in Fabric

- **SQL Database in Fabric:** Reliable relational engine, T-SQL support, tight integration with SSMS, VS Code, and CI/CD. Security features include SQL Auditing and Customer Managed Keys.
- **Cosmos DB in Fabric:** Distributed NoSQL support for semi-structured data, low latency serving, Spark job feature storage, and vector indexing for fast queries.
