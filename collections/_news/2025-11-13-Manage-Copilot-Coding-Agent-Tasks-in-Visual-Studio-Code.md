Allison introduces new capabilities for managing GitHub Copilot coding agent tasks directly within Visual Studio Code, detailing how developers can centralize their coding workflows and seamlessly interact with Copilot's mission control features.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Manage Copilot Coding Agent Tasks in Visual Studio Code

Developers can now monitor, track, and manage [Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent) sessions without ever leaving Visual Studio Code. This integration brings a mission control view, centralizing all necessary tools and information to streamline your workflow.

## Centralized Mission Control

- **Agent Sessions Panel:** View the full session log directly inside VS Code, including real-time rationale for Copilot's code commits.
- **Task View:** Effortlessly switch between different Copilot-agent-driven coding tasks, immediately see each task's status, and quickly jump in when your input is required.
- **Visual Feedback:** Instantly recognize where Copilot is active and where user involvement is needed, thanks to intuitive task indicators and session logs.

## Flexible Session Continuation

- Open your Copilot coding agent session in the environment that fits you best: Visual Studio Code, Codespaces, or the GitHub CLI.
- From the sessions view on github.com, click **Open in VS Code** to load your ongoing Copilot session directly into your editor.
- Continue collaborating, editing, or managing tasks without switching tools.

## Setup and Access

- The Copilot coding agent features are accessible to anyone with Copilot coding agent access and write access to their repository.
- Ensure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code, the GitHub Copilot Chat extension, and the [GitHub Pull Requests extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) installed for the smoothest experience.

## Community and Feedback

Share your experiences or ask questions about Copilot coding agent features in the [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/177791).
