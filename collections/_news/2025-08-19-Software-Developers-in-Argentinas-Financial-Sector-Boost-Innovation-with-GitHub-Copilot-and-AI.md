sbaynes examines how developers at Galicia and other banks in Argentina are using GitHub Copilot and AI tools to speed up development, improve productivity, and innovate in a rapidly changing financial sector.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Software Developers in Argentina’s Financial Sector Boost Innovation with GitHub Copilot and AI

In April, Argentina’s Central Bank ended almost six years of stringent currency controls, triggering a rapid response from the country's financial institutions. Bank Galicia’s technology team, for example, raced to implement free dollar transaction capabilities in their banking app—before the next business day.

A key factor enabling this fast-paced development was the use of AI-driven tools. Developers at Galicia employed [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), an AI assistant for developers, to generate code and accelerate the software update process. This tool provided context-aware suggestions, autocompletion for code, and natural language prompts that expedited both code writing and security checks.

Germán Gross, Galicia’s head of architecture, emphasized that code assistants gave the team the speed necessary to realize urgent changes while maintaining quality and security standards. Senior developer Marcelo Fabián Gutiérrez reported that accomplishing the update on time would have been highly unlikely without GitHub Copilot, noting increased productivity and improved work performance thanks to the tool.

Developers at Galicia take advantage of GitHub Copilot’s chat capabilities in three modes—ask, edit, and agent—which help them tackle more complex tasks efficiently. The AI-driven code completions, full-function generation, and real-time interaction have fueled greater agility among teams.

Beyond Galicia, developers across Argentina’s financial sector are seeing the benefits of AI integration: producing higher-quality code faster, learning new problem-solving approaches, and delivering improved services to end-users. For banks, the ability to launch features swiftly is critical in a competitive market defined by both digital newcomers and long-standing economic volatility.

The case demonstrates how AI tools like GitHub Copilot are not only reshaping the way code is written but are also contributing to technological advancement and customer-centric innovation in financial services.
