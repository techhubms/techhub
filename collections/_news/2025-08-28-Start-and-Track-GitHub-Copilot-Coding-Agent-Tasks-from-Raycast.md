Allison explains how developers can leverage the Raycast extension on macOS to start and monitor GitHub Copilot coding agent tasks, streamlining interaction with Copilot directly from the desktop.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Start and Track GitHub Copilot Coding Agent Tasks from Raycast

Raycast is a powerful launcher for macOS that lets users quickly access apps, search files, control system functions, and use extensions. With the new GitHub Copilot extension, developers can now interact directly with AI-enabled Copilot coding agents from anywhere on their Mac.

## Starting a Copilot Coding Agent Task

To start a new Copilot task with Raycast:

1. Open Raycast using `Command+Space`.
2. Use the **Create Task** command from the GitHub Copilot extension.
3. Select the repository, enter your development prompt, and confirm with `Command+Return`.

Copilot creates a draft pull request, works on your task in the background, and notifies you when the task is complete and ready for review.

## Tracking Copilot Tasks

You can monitor your Copilot coding agent tasks from Raycast, whether they were started from Raycast, from GitHub’s agents panel, or directly from a GitHub issue. To do this:

1. Open Raycast.
2. Select the **View Tasks** command in the Copilot extension to see task progress and status.
