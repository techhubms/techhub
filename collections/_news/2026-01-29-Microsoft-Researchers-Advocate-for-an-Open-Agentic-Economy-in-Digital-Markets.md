# Microsoft Researchers Advocate for an Open Agentic Economy in Digital Markets

Imagine a future where your digital assistant doesn't just respond to simple queries but actively shops, negotiates, and transacts on your behalf across a variety of digital marketplaces. In their recent paper published in *Communications of the ACM*, Microsoft researchers outline the benefits and requirements for an 'open agentic economy'—a decentralized ecosystem where AI agents can interact and transact directly with each other, moving beyond the limitations of siloed, 'walled garden' platforms.

## What is an Open Agentic Economy?

Instead of users being restricted to the AI agents provided within individual platforms (such as an airline's website), an open agentic economy envisions a 'web of agents' operating in a manner similar to the original promise of the World Wide Web: any agent can transact with any other agent, no matter their origin. Here, assistant agents function like browsers, while service agents act as the digital equivalent of websites.

Microsoft researcher David Rothschild warns that a handful of companies currently control a large share of users' 'digital time' and will naturally seek to maintain these silos. By starting discussions now on keeping agentic economies open, the researchers hope to avoid a future of restricted innovation and reduced consumer choice.

## Why Go Open?

The open agentic economy model allows for smoother market operations, easier service switching for consumers, increased competition, and a shift from the 'attention economy' (focusing on capturing user attention) to a 'preference economy' (meeting users' actual needs). Co-author Matt Vogel emphasizes that this environment gives consumers true choice and encourages businesses to improve products over relying on advertising alone.

## Making It Happen

Key enablers include:

- Widespread adoption of both assistant and service agents
- Standardized communication frameworks and secure inter-agent protocols
- Collaborative digital marketplaces (not owned by a single entity)

Multiple stakeholder groups—technology companies, standards bodies, businesses, and regulatory authorities—must work together to ensure these markets remain open, secure, and competitive. The authors stress the need for ongoing open research and development to balance safety, competition, and control.
