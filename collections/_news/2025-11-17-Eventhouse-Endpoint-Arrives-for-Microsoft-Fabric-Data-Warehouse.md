# Eventhouse Endpoint Arrives for Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse

Microsoft Fabric is expanding its real-time analytics capabilities with the new Eventhouse Endpoint for the Fabric Data Warehouse. Previously exclusive to Fabric Lakehouse, Eventhouse now brings its powerful engine to warehouse scenarios.

## What is Eventhouse?

Eventhouse is a high-performance, real-time analytics engine in Microsoft Fabric. It can ingest, index, and query massive volumes of time-series, structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Eventhouse endpoints allow users to work with familiar languages like KQL and SQL for fast and flexible analytics, previously only for Lakehouse workloads.

## What's New: Fabric Data Warehouse Support

- Real-time querying for Data Warehouse tables using KQL or SQL
- Schema mirroring for Data Warehouse tables
- Unification of analytics across Lakehouse and Data Warehouse—no need to duplicate data

## Benefits and Scenarios

Enabling the Eventhouse Endpoint for Fabric Data Warehouse gives users:

- Consistent performance and familiar query experience
- Unified tooling and monitoring across Microsoft Fabric
- Real-time insights on structured data without additional ETL steps

Ideal for use cases such as:

- Monitoring business KPIs alongside live telemetry and operational data
- Detecting anomalies in key metrics
- Building dashboards that combine historical and current streaming events

## Getting Started

To enable Eventhouse Endpoint for your Fabric Data Warehouse:

1. Go to your Fabric workspace.
2. Select your Data Warehouse.
3. Enable the Eventhouse Endpoint from the Workspace Menu or OneLake catalog.
4. Begin querying with KQL or SQL—no data movement required.
