# Microsoft Purview Innovations for Fabric: Unifying Data Security and Governance for AI

**Author:** Rudra Mitra

## Introduction

The Microsoft Fabric and Purview teams have announced substantial innovations at the European Microsoft Fabric Community Conference 2025 in Vienna. These updates are designed to help organizations unify data security, governance, and compliance in the age of AI-powered transformation.

## The Importance of Trusted Data in the AI Era

Data quality, reliability, and governance are foundational to building safe and effective AI solutions. Flawed, incomplete, or sensitive data can compromise AI outcomes, leading to security leaks and eroding organizational trust. Microsoft stresses that integrating holistic data security and governance is essential for responsible AI deployment.

## Empowering Secure Data with Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview offers a unified solution consolidating security, governance, and compliance across diverse cloud platforms including Azure, Microsoft 365, and Fabric. Newly announced Purview features at FabCon Vienna include:

### 1. Risk Discovery and Data Protection

- **Information Protection Policies for Fabric and OneLake:** Now generally available, allowing granular policy-driven data access and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) in OneLake. This prevents data oversharing by applying policy tips and sensitivity labels.
- **Insider Risk Management for Power BI:** Generally available, this feature extends built-in risk indicators for Power BI activities (e.g., data viewing, exporting, and label management). Organizations gain better detection of suspicious or unauthorized behaviors.
- **Data Risk Assessments for Fabric:** In preview, enabling discovery of overshared assets across top Fabric workspaces. Automated assessments highlight data most at risk and provide organizations with actionable remediation insights.
- **Data Security and Compliance for Copilot in Power BI:** Now generally available. Purview monitors Copilot prompt and response data for sensitive information and offers recommendations to maintain responsible AI use.

## Data Discovery and Quality Management

- **Unified Data Catalog:** Purview's Unified Catalog enhances data discoverability, enabling users to find, trust, and activate Fabric data for analytics and AI workloads. New capabilities allow cataloging at table, column, and file levels, as well as defining custom business attributes to improve clarity and usage.
- **Error Records Integration:** Fabric users can now view and address data quality errors directly in OneLake, facilitating remediation and improved confidence in analytics outputs.

## Looking Forward

Microsoft reiterates its commitment to enabling responsible, scalable, and secure AI-driven innovation. The latest advances in Purview and Fabric offer organizations comprehensive tools for safeguarding and governing data estates, streamlining compliance, and fueling AI transformation at scale.
