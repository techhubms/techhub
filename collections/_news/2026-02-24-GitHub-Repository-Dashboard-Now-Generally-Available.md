# GitHub Repository Dashboard Now Generally Available

The [repository dashboard](https://github.com/repos) has moved from public preview to general availability, offering a central hub for managing all repositories you can access on GitHub. The release brings features aimed at improving repository discovery, filtering, and workflow efficiency.

## What’s New in the General Availability Release

- **Admin Access View**: Easily surface all repositories where you have admin permissions, simplifying project settings and configuration management.
- **Command Palette Integration**: Launch the repository dashboard directly from the [GitHub command palette](https://docs.github.com/get-started/accessibility/github-command-palette) to streamline access without interrupting your workflow.

## How to Access the Dashboard

- Go directly to [github.com/repos](https://github.com/repos).
- Click the repositories icon in the global navigation bar.
- Use the left-hand menu and choose **Repositories**.
- Open the command palette and search for “Repositories.”

## Key Features

- **Central Repository Discovery**: See all repositories you have contributed to or have access to, whether personal or enterprise.
- **Curated Default Views**: Instantly access repositories through default categories like `My contributions`, `My repositories`, `My forks`, and `Admin access`.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Narrow results using filters such as `visibility`, `language`, `organization`, and sort options.
- **Saved Queries**: Bookmark and save custom filter sets for recurring searches and workflows.
