# Changing the Physics of Cyber Defense: Graph-Based Strategies and AI

Microsoft’s Deputy CISOs provide in-depth insights into the future of cyber defense, focusing on actionable tactics, strategic guidance, and lessons learned from the front lines of security.

## Graph-Powered Defense: Thinking Like Attackers

Ten years ago, Microsoft established MSTIC to track cyberattackers migrating to the Microsoft Cloud. Defenders benefit by modeling infrastructure as graphs—a directed graph of credentials, dependencies, and entitlements. Attackers exploit footholds, secrets, and lateral movement using these relationships. By reconstructing activity across siloed logs, defenders can visualize threats and anticipate attacker movement.

Defenders should build attack graphs for assets, enabling analysis of blast radius, lateral movement risk, and potential impact. Microsoft leverages Azure Data Explorer and KQL for deep data analysis but also augments tabular data with graph representations, anomalies, and vectors over time—the 'algebras of defense.' Advanced AI systems increasingly support these analyses, helping security teams detect the difference between normal and anomalous behaviour with expert intuition.

## Cyber Defense Hygiene: Building Difficult Terrain

Strong cyber hygiene makes environments harder to attack. Invest in preventative controls like:

- Endpoint protection (e.g., Microsoft Defender for Endpoint)
- Network segmentation
- Behavioral analytics
- Threat modeling
- Reviewing and updating entitlement management
- Inventory asset management and removal of orphaned resources

Organizations should retire legacy systems and monitor real-time inventories of assets, users, and applications. Multifactor authentication and hardened, pre-identified admin access locations raise the cost for attackers and create difficult terrain for traversal. Layered, predictable defenses minimize noise and reduce attackers’ ability to hide.

## Internal Expertise and Security Collaboration

Remediation remains core to defense. Educated analysts need data visibility and telemetry to distinguish signal from noise. Crucially, Microsoft advocates for collaborative defense: sharing breach details, threat intelligence, and incident response insights across organizations—even competitors—through trusted security forums and information-sharing networks.

## Optimizing the Defense Curve with AI

Today, defenders leverage vast data sets, graphs, and advanced AI to interrogate environments, surface insights, and respond proactively. The 'algebras of defense' (tabular, graph, anomaly, vector data views) empower both humans and AI to make informed, multidimensional decisions. AI-enabled defenders turn complexity into actionable clarity—rewriting the physics of defense and reclaiming advantage against attackers.
