# Major Updates to Copilot Spaces: Public Spaces and Code View Integration

**Author: Allison**

GitHub Copilot Spaces has introduced three notable updates designed to support open collaboration and efficient developer workflows:

## 1. Public Spaces

- Developers can now make individual-owned spaces publicly accessible via direct link.
- Useful for sharing open-source documentation, templates, and educational demos.
- Public spaces are view-only by default, protecting content integrity.
- Available for individual-owned spaces, not organization-owned spaces.
- Security is preserved through enforced role-based access control; no sensitive information is exposed.

## 2. Individual Sharing

- Individual spaces can now be shared with others, promoting collaboration and lightweight workflows.
- Access controls provide granular management of visibility and permissions.

## 3. Add Files Directly from Code Viewer

- Users can add files to a Copilot Space directly from the github.com code viewer.
- This workflow reduces context switching and embeds collaboration entry points into routine developer activity.
- Only files users have permission to access can be added.
- Repository and space-level access controls remain in effect.

## Security and Privacy Highlights

- Content exposure is limited to what the viewer is authorized to access.
- Role-based access control is strictly maintained.
- Changes in permissions are applied instantly to maintain security.
