# Fabric Environment Library Management Performance Improvements for Developers

Microsoft Fabric has introduced significant performance improvements to its Environment library management:

## Key Enhancements

- **Faster Publishing for JAR and Python Files:**
  - Environment publishing now completes up to 2.5x faster than before.
  - Custom JAR and `.py` file installations that once took several minutes now finish in under a minute.

- **Improved Python Package Publishing:**
  - Both public and custom Python package publishing has accelerated, enabling rapid testing and deployment cycles.

- **Spark Session Startup Speed:**
  - Spark sessions attached to environments with Python libraries now start up to 70% faster.
  - Applies to live sessions and on-demand workloads, improving interactive development and production reliability.
