## Introduction

Security operations centers (SOCs) face increasing complexity and scale. The integration of AI, particularly autonomous agents, is reshaping how security teams defend against evolving threats. This article details Microsoft Defender Experts' approach to developing GenAI-powered SOCs, where AI augments but does not replace human expertise.

## Building Autonomous AI Agents for MDR Operations

Defender Experts are implementing autonomous AI agents with structured guardrails and human-in-the-loop validation. These agents accelerate investigations, triage noise, and free analysts from repetitive tasks. Real-world impact includes:

- Automated triage of 50% of security noise with high precision
- 75% of phishing and malware incidents processed by AI agents
- Incidents resolved 72% faster while maintaining quality and transparency

## Shifting Roles and Skillsets in SOC

AI agents transform the workflow and skill requirements for security analysts:

- Analysts transition from manual investigations to strategic decision-makers
- Focus shifts to advanced problem-solving, posture data analysis, and cross-product threat intelligence
- Prompt engineering emerges as a key skill for leveraging GenAI

## Technology Underpinnings

Building reliable GenAI-based solutions requires:

- Expert-defined guardrails and curated test sets
- Deployment-time checks for reliability
- Multilayer orchestration engines coordinating rule-based logic, GenAI features, and traditional AI
- Compliance, privacy, and quality controls throughout development and release

## Human and AI Collaboration Model

The SOC of the future is a partnership:

- Humans retain oversight and governance
- AI agents handle time-intensive and repetitive tasks
- Continuous human-AI feedback loops maintain trust, transparency, and learning

## Practical Guidance for SOC Transformation

Key recommendations based on Defender Experts’ experience:

- Anticipate process changes and plan for lifecycle management of AI adoption
- Foster a mindset shift and provide analyst training for GenAI workflows
- Maintain human-AI feedback loops for trustworthy automation
- Orchestrate traditional automation and AI for consistent quality and efficiency

## Conclusion

Microsoft Defender Experts believe that human and AI collaboration positions SOCs to be faster, smarter, and more resilient. Their ongoing development and sharing of insights aim to help other security teams navigate this transformation confidently.
