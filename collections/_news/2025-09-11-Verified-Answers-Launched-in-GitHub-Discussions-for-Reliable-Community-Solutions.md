# Verified Answers Launched in GitHub Discussions for Reliable Community Solutions

GitHub Discussions has introduced a new feature called **Verified Answers**, which allows repository administrators to highlight authoritative and trustworthy solutions within community threads.

## What Are Verified Answers?

- **Verified Answers** are a new answer state, sitting above the traditional **Marked as Answer**.
- This badge signifies that a response has not only been accepted by the discussion author but also reviewed by a repository administrator for accuracy and reliability.
- The feature aims to improve trust in community support by clearly distinguishing the most accurate and trustworthy answers.

## Why Does It Matter?

- Verified answers address the challenge of finding reliable information in fast-moving developer communities.
- By limiting verification to repository admins, GitHub introduces an extra layer of quality assurance.
- This is helpful for users looking for reliable solutions to product questions, troubleshooting requests, or bug reports, especially on [community.github.com](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/).
- Verified answers support responsible AI practices by providing accurate content for integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) and GitHub Copilot.

## How to Use Verified Answers

**Requirements:**

- Admin permissions on the repository.
- Discussions enabled for the repository.
- At least one answer in the discussion thread.

**How to Verify an Answer:**

1. Open the discussion with existing answers.
2. Find the answer to verify.
3. Use the 3-dot menu next to the answer.
4. Select the new **Verify answer** option.

Once verified, the answer will display a special badge. Contributors scanning through discussions can quickly spot trusted answers.
