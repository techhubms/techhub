# GPT-5 Mini Launches in Public Preview for GitHub Copilot Users

GitHub Copilot has rolled out GPT-5 mini, a new OpenAI model designed to deliver quick, accurate coding support at a lower cost and with reduced latency. This public preview brings several notable improvements and accessibility enhancements to Copilot users:

## Key Features of GPT-5 Mini

- **Speed and Efficiency**: GPT-5 mini processes coding requests faster and more cost-effectively than previous models, with lower latency and strong performance on focused tasks.
- **Optimized for Precision**: Particularly effective for well-defined prompts and quick coding edits, helping developers get accurate results rapidly.

## Availability.

- **Universal Access**: GPT-5 mini is rolling out to all GitHub Copilot plans, including Copilot Free.
- **Platform Integration**: Access is available in Copilot Chat on github.com, Visual Studio Code (via the chat model picker), and GitHub Mobile on both iOS and Android. Future releases plan to support additional IDEs.
- **No Premium Request Charges**: On paid Copilot plans, using GPT-5 mini will not consume premium requests, making it more accessible for frequent use. [Model multipliers documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests) provides further billing details.

## Enabling GPT-5 Mini for Teams/Organizations

- For Copilot Enterprise and Business customers, administrators can opt in by enabling the GPT-5 mini policy within Copilot settings. Once activated, users will see **GPT-5 mini (Preview)** as a selectable model in supported applications.
