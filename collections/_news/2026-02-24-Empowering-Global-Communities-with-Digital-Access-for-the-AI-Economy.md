stclarke outlines Microsoft’s efforts in connecting more than 299 million people worldwide, focusing on digital access, partnerships, and community enablement to foster inclusive participation in the AI economy.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Empowering Global Communities with Digital Access for the AI Economy

Microsoft has achieved a major milestone by expanding digital connectivity to over 299 million people worldwide—ahead of its original goal of 250 million by 2025. This accomplishment is the result of more than a decade of partnership-driven efforts with governments, nonprofits, local connectivity providers, and development partners, with a particular impact in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.

## The Importance of Digital Access in the AI Era

With 2.2 billion people still offline, digital inclusion remains a global challenge. As AI adoption accelerates, reliable internet and electricity are fundamental requirements for communities to fully participate in the digital and AI-driven economy. Microsoft’s [AI Access Principles](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/02/26/microsoft-ai-access-principles-responsible-mobile-world-congress/) underscore that infrastructure gaps can widen economic divides if unaddressed. For example, in Zambia, just 12% of the general population uses generative AI, but that number jumps to 34% among those with internet access.

## Evolving Approach: More Than Just Connectivity

Microsoft’s latest model recognizes that access alone is not enough. The company is moving toward a holistic digital access strategy that combines internet connections with electricity, water (where relevant), affordable devices, and digital skills. Programs are designed to be sustainable and responsive to community needs, involving local institutions such as schools, health facilities, and cooperatives, and supported by public and private sector partners.

This approach aligns with the [Community First AI Infrastructure](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/), providing not just the foundation for connectivity but also the enablement required for long-term, real-world AI participation.

## Partnerships Powering Progress

Sustained impact has only been possible through strong, localized partnerships:

- **Africa:** Collaborations with [Cassava Technologies](https://www.cassavatechnologies.com/) and [Tizeti](https://www.tizeti.com/) are expanding reliable, affordable internet—frequently using solar-powered networks.
- **Latin America:** In Colombia, [Anditel](https://www.anditel.com/) brings internet and energy access to rural and agricultural communities.
- **India:** [AirJaldi](https://airjaldi.com/) is pairing connectivity with digital training to encourage practical adoption.

## Expanding Access Through Satellite Collaboration

Microsoft has announced a new partnership with Starlink to combine low-Earth orbit satellite connectivity with community-based deployment. For instance, in Kenya, Microsoft is working with Starlink and [Mawingu Networks](https://mawingu.co/) to connect 450 rural hubs, benefitting farmer groups and digital community centers, and supporting digital and AI-enabled agricultural services.

## Towards AI-Ready Communities

The journey doesn’t end at 299 million. Microsoft is focusing future efforts on ensuring that internet access leads to meaningful adoption and opportunity, especially in the AI space. This involves scaling partnerships, creating sustainable financial models, and deploying community-first solutions that integrate connectivity, energy, devices, and digital skills.

Through these concerted efforts, Microsoft aims to bridge the digital divide and enable inclusive participation in the burgeoning global AI economy.
