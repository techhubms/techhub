# Microsoft Unveils Partnership with TitletownTech and NJ AI Hub to Advance Scientific Discovery via AI

Microsoft has announced a significant new partnership with leading centers of innovation—TitletownTech (with the University of Wisconsin-Madison) and the New Jersey AI Hub (with Princeton University)—to accelerate scientific discovery using AI and high-performance computing.

## Introduction: AI's Transformative Role in Science

Artificial intelligence is transforming scientific research, enabling new breakthroughs in fields ranging from medical research to manufacturing. Microsoft, through its TechSpark program, has been collaborating with communities nationwide for eight years, supporting job creation and funding innovation.

## The Microsoft Discovery Platform

Central to this announcement is the Microsoft Discovery platform. This advanced, agentic AI system combines AI agents with a graph-based knowledge engine, designed to empower researchers and startups to:

- Analyze massive datasets
- Simulate complex experiments
- Uncover new materials and solutions quickly
- Collaborate with teams of human and AI agents in real time

Microsoft Discovery remains in private preview, but this partnership gives researchers early access and the support of Microsoft's expert teams, including those involved with quantum research.

## Focus Areas and Real-World Impact

Key application domains include:

- Chemistry and catalyst design (e.g., improving recycling processes for plastic waste)
- Life sciences
- Advanced manufacturing
- AI-driven innovation

Practical examples already demonstrated by Microsoft include rapid design and synthesis of a novel sustainable coolant for datacenter immersion cooling, moving from digital models to a working prototype in four months.

## Collaboration Model

The partnership blends:

- Startup agility (TitletownTech)
- Academic expertise (University of Wisconsin-Madison and Princeton University)
- Microsoft’s AI and computing infrastructure

The goal is to democratize access to advanced AI tools for researchers, ensuring that scientific advancements can reach a wide range of communities and fuel local innovation ecosystems.

## What's Next?

Microsoft will work with these partners to enable access to the Discovery platform, starting in private preview and aiming for wider availability in the future. Continued engagement is planned with additional universities and research centers to broaden the impact of this initiative.

## Commitment to Innovation

Through deep integration of AI and community collaboration, Microsoft affirms its commitment to driving scientific progress, sustainability, and innovation in Wisconsin, New Jersey, and beyond.
