# New Organization Sharing and Local Development Improvements in GitHub Spark

GitHub Spark has introduced several updates aimed at improving collaboration and developer workflows. Authored by Allison, these changes make it easier to build and share apps within teams while smoothing out key parts of the development lifecycle.

## ✨ New Features

- **Organization Sharing**: Users can now share their sparks directly with a specific GitHub organization. This provides secure, organization-wide access and makes collaboration easier. The new 'Publish' modal lets you select which organization to share with, ensuring sparks remain protected yet accessible to all relevant teammates.

- **Improved Local Development Experience**: Easily create a repository for your spark and open it instantly in a Codespace for rapid iteration. Start development with `npm run dev` to expand your app.

- **Deployment Visibility**: See at a glance which version of your spark has been deployed and track if subsequent changes have moved your project beyond the currently deployed state.

- **Discord Link Previews**: Sharing spark links in Discord now automatically generates a branded preview, helping users see important details about the app being shared.

- **IME Language Support**: GitHub Spark now better supports input methods for languages such as Japanese and Chinese, preventing issues like premature submission during typing.

- **Easier Reverts**: The new **Restore** button in the iteration panel makes reverting to previous versions more straightforward.

## 🐞 Notable Bug Fixes

- Addressed flickering in the Data Panel during high-rate interactions with Spark KV store.
- Background process `*.pid` files no longer appear as manual edits in the iteration panel, cleaning up the editor experience.

## 🚀 Get Started
