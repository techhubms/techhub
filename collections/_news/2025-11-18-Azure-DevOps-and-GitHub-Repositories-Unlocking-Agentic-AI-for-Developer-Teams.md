# Azure DevOps and GitHub Repositories: Unlocking Agentic AI for Developer Teams

GitHub Copilot has rapidly evolved from a coding assistant to an AI-powered peer programmer, introducing a new era of agentic development. With new features like Agent HQ, developers can now orchestrate and manage AI agents across different environments for increased productivity, security, and governance.

## Key Advancements

- **Agent HQ**: Provides observability, governance, and security controls for managing AI agents, enabling organizations to audit, enforce policies, and control access.
- **GitHub Code Quality**: Offers in-context findings, maintainability scores, and one-click fixes to improve code health and reliability.
- **Deep GitHub and Azure DevOps Integration**: Teams benefit from seamless migration and hybrid use, leveraging both GitHub and Azure DevOps features like Boards and Pipelines.

## Migration and Integration

- **Migration to GitHub**: Organizations can migrate repositories effortlessly via [GitHub Enterprise Importer](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/using-github-enterprise-importer/migrating-from-azure-devops-to-github-enterprise-cloud). Detailed guides and hands-on support are available for a smooth transition.
- **Data Residency and Governance**: With GitHub Enterprise Cloud, teams in the US, Europe, and Australia can manage data residency requirements for both GitHub and Azure DevOps.
- **Boards Integration**: Azure Boards now supports the GitHub Coding Agent, enabling planning and execution with Copilot’s automation for development, testing, and backlog management.
- **MCP Server**: The Azure DevOps MCP Server unlocks additional agentic capabilities, allowing automated backlog reprioritization, enhanced Epics, test plan generation, and troubleshooting assistance.
- **Licensing and Access**: Copilot licenses and Azure DevOps Basic rights are streamlined under GitHub Enterprise, simplifying management without split organizations or complex sales processes.

## Use Copilot Across Platforms

- **For Azure Repos Users**: Copilot’s agentic capabilities are accessible even without migration. Visual Studio 2026 and VS Code integrate Copilot-driven workflows—such as code writing, test and documentation generation, application modernization, and deployment to Azure.
- **Automation and Collaboration**: Copilot automates a broad variety of developer tasks, supports spec-driven development, and enhances team collaboration through deep integration with both GitHub and Azure DevOps.

## Security and Governance Enhancements

- **Centralized Controls**: Agent HQ delivers robust governance, with features for access management, policy enforcement, and auditing across all agentic activities.
- **Role-Based Access**: Enterprise-ready controls provide secure, role-based management of teams and projects.

## Conclusion

The combined capabilities of GitHub Copilot, Agent HQ, and Azure DevOps empower teams to automate workflows, improve code quality, and collaborate efficiently—while maintaining high standards of security and compliance. Migrating to GitHub and leveraging these integrations allows organizations to innovate rapidly within a secure, governed, and enterprise-ready environment.
