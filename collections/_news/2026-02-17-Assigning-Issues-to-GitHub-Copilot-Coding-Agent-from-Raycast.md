Allison explains how developers can now assign issues to the GitHub Copilot coding agent directly from Raycast, enabling automated background task handling and workflow optimization.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Assigning Issues to GitHub Copilot Coding Agent from Raycast

GitHub’s Copilot coding agent is an asynchronous, autonomous agent that can handle coding tasks in the background, freeing up developers for other work. When you delegate a task to Copilot, it works independently and later requests your review when its work is complete.

## Assigning Issues via Raycast

Raycast is a free launcher application available on both Windows and macOS. With Raycast, you can extend your workflow using community-built extensions such as the GitHub Copilot extension.

### Steps to Assign an Issue

1. **Install the GitHub Copilot extension in Raycast.**
2. **Use the “Assign Issue to Copilot” command:**
   - Select the relevant repository and issue.
   - Press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) or `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) to assign.
3. **Copilot Actions:**
   - Copilot will open a pull request and begin working on the assigned task in the background.
   - When finished, Copilot requests a review from you.

### Additional Features

- **“Create Task” Command:** Initiate new Copilot tasks that aren’t linked to a GitHub issue.
- **“View Tasks” Command:** Track the progress of tasks already delegated to Copilot.

## Availability

- The Copilot coding agent feature is accessible to subscribers of Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise.
- For Copilot Business and Enterprise subscribers, an administrator must enable the Copilot coding agent via the Policies page.
- [Enable the Copilot coding agent — GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/enabling-copilot-coding-agent)
