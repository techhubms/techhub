# Copilot Memory Early Access for Pro and Pro+

GitHub has released Copilot Memory in early access for users subscribed to Copilot Pro and Pro+. This new feature is supported in both Copilot Coding Agent and Copilot Code Review environments.

## What is Copilot Memory?

Copilot Memory allows Copilot agents to learn from your codebase over time. By capturing and remembering key insights specific to your repositories, Copilot Memory improves the contextual assistance provided during both coding and code review workflows. This means suggestions and feedback become better tailored to your projects as agents accumulate knowledge.

- **Continuous learning:** Copilot Memory updates as your codebase evolves.
- **Context sharing:** Insights are shared across Copilot agents to enhance the relevance of code suggestions and reviews.
- **Repository-specific optimization:** Memory is unique to each codebase, improving personalization.

## How to Enable Copilot Memory

If you are a GitHub Copilot Pro or Pro+ user:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Copilot** in your GitHub account.
2. Enable the **Copilot Memory** feature.

## Ongoing Development and Feedback

GitHub is actively developing Copilot Memory and plans to expand its availability to additional plans in the future. Users are encouraged to share their experiences and suggestions to help refine the feature.

- **Get involved:** Join the discussion or leave feedback in the [GitHub Community announcements](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).
