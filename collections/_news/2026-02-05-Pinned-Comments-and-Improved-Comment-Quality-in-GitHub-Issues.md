# Pinned Comments and Improved Comment Quality in GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues has received two important updates designed to streamline project communication and reduce distraction:

## 1. Pin a Comment on an Issue

- You can now pin a comment to the top of an issue from the `...` menu in the comment options.
- Pinned comments can highlight key updates, important decisions, or next steps.
- This ensures that anyone visiting the issue immediately sees the most critical information at the top.

## 2. Fewer Low-Quality Comments

- GitHub now encourages users to use reactions (like 👍) or subscribe to issues rather than posting brief comments such as “+1” or “same here.”
- A gentle prompt appears when users try to leave such comments, helping keep discussions relevant and reducing unnecessary notifications.
- This change helps contributors focus on meaningful conversations and decisions within issues.
