# Auto Model Selection for GitHub Copilot in JetBrains, Xcode, and Eclipse

GitHub Copilot now features an **Auto** mode for selecting the best available model on your behalf in JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse. This new capability streamlines your coding workflow by optimizing AI model selection based on availability and subscription type.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Model Selection**: With the Auto option in Copilot Chat's model picker, the system chooses among models like GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, GPT-4.1, Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5.
- **Universal Availability**: All Copilot plans can use Auto mode in supported editors.
- **Transparency**: Easily see which model generated a response by hovering over it.
- **User Control**: You can switch between Auto and explicit model choices at any time.
- **Policy Compliance**: Auto honors all individual or administered model settings.

## Premium Request Usage

- Premium request consumption is based on the selected model's multiplier. See the [billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests#model-multipliers) for specific details.
- Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise users benefit from a 10% discount on the model multiplier when using Auto.

## How to Get Started

- **Individual Users**: Go to Copilot Chat in your editor and select **Auto** in the model picker.
- **Business and Enterprise Users**: Your administrator must enable the **Editor Preview Features** policy before you can access Auto mode. Consult the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection) for more information.

## Roadmap and Feedback

This public preview optimizes for model availability, but future updates will make selections more intelligent and context-aware. User feedback will influence upcoming enhancements. Join the [community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations) to contribute your ideas.
