# Windows PC Gaming Innovations in 2025: Handheld Devices, Arm Expansion, and DirectX Upgrades

Windows continues to lead as a gaming platform through partnerships with developers, hardware manufacturers, and the broader gaming ecosystem. This year's highlights push boundaries for performance, portability, and immersive graphics on both desktops and handhelds.

## Handheld Gaming Advancements

- ROG Xbox Ally / Ally X handhelds, powered by AMD Ryzen Z2 processors, deliver optimized performance, power efficiency, and responsiveness.
- The Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE) brings a console-like, controller-first interface to handheld Windows devices, minimizing background tasks for better frame pacing.
- Advanced Shader Delivery (ASD) on the ROG Xbox Ally precompiles game shaders at install time, which reduced first-run load times for titles like Avowed (by 80%) and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (by 95%).
- ASD is available to game studios via the Agility SDK, making integration for optimized gameplay more accessible.
- System improvements include tuned power management and CPU frequency profiles, unified memory behavior, and lower CPU overhead for inputs and background services through collaboration with AMD and ASUS.

## Windows Gaming on Arm

- Expanded support for Arm-based Windows PCs now includes local installs via the Xbox PC app for Game Pass titles, improving playability beyond cloud streaming.
- The Prism emulator enhances compatibility by supporting AVX/AVX2, vital for modern games.
- Native anti-cheat support from providers like Easy Anti-Cheat and integration with security features like Virtualization-Based Security (VBS), Secure Boot, TPM 2.0, and remote attestation strengthens game integrity and fair play on Arm devices.

## DirectX and Audio Innovations

- DirectX Raytracing 1.2 (DXR 1.2): Opacity Micromaps and Shader Execution Reordering boost ray tracing performance up to 2.3× and improve realism.
- Neural rendering preview integrates efficient ML models for denoising, upscaling, and material enhancement in Shader Model 6.9, using cooperative vectors and extended linear algebra capabilities.
- Bluetooth LE Audio delivers lower latency and high-quality spatial game audio, supporting wideband stereo and better accessibility, including streaming to hearing aids and cochlear implants.

## Security and Fair Play

- Strengthened security through hardware-rooted protections, including Secure Boot, TPM 2.0, VBS, and remote attestation enable a trusted state for competitive gameplay.
- Major anti-cheat systems now support both x64 and Arm devices, lowering barriers for fair multiplayer matches.

## AI and ML Features for Game Developers and Players

- Auto Super Resolution (Auto SR): OS-level AI upscaling for sharper visuals and smoother framerates, first launched on Copilot+ PCs with Snapdragon X, coming to ROG Xbox Ally X with Ryzen AI NPU.
- Early integration of ASD and Auto SR for more game titles and hardware platforms.
- Neural rendering advances use machine learning for real-time enhancements in the graphics pipeline, marking a trend toward AI-powered gameplay and development.

## What’s Next

- Windows 11 continues to prioritize background workload management, graphics stack optimization, and driver improvements in future releases.
- Full Screen Experience expands to more PC form factors beyond handhelds, available in preview for Insiders.
- Developers and gamers are encouraged to update to the latest Windows 11 builds, participate in Insider programs, and look forward to more announcements from events like GDC.
