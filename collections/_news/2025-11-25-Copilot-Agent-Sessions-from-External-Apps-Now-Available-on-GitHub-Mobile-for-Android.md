# Copilot Agent Sessions from External Apps Now Available on GitHub Mobile for Android

GitHub Mobile for Android has introduced a workflow enhancement that helps developers and users streamline agent session creation directly from external apps. With the new custom action integrated into the Android sharesheet, you can now select and share text—such as notes, messages, or project plans—from any Android application into a Copilot agent session in GitHub Mobile.

## How It Works

- Use the Android sharesheet to select and share text from any external app directly into the Copilot agent session in the GitHub Mobile app.
- This feature allows seamless transition from idea drafting in various apps to actionable developer tasks guided by Copilot.

## Who Can Use It

- Anyone who installs and uses GitHub Mobile for Android.

## Key Benefits

- Instantly convert ideas and plans into Copilot agent tasks on GitHub.
- Enhance efficiency when brainstorming features, mapping projects, and planning within the GitHub ecosystem.
- Simplifies the process of transforming external inspiration into concrete development actions.

## Getting Started

1. Draft a note, message, or idea in your favorite Android app.
2. Share the text using the Android sharesheet and select GitHub Mobile for Android's Copilot agent session option.
3. The shared content becomes the basis for a new Copilot agent session, enabling Copilot-powered assistance on your project or feature.
