# Announcing Public Preview: Phishing Triage Agent in Microsoft Defender

**Author:** Cristina Da Gama Henriquez  
**Updated:** August 5, 2025  

## Overview

Microsoft introduces the Phishing Triage Agent in Microsoft Defender, now available in public preview. This solution is designed to reduce the operational burden for Security Operations Centers (SOC) by automating the triage of user-reported phishing emails, leveraging AI and large language models (LLMs). The agent operates as a part of Defender’s AI innovation wave announced at Microsoft Secure 2025, alongside other Security Copilot agents that aim to provide autonomous, adaptive security operations.

## Key Features

### Autonomous, AI-Powered Triage

- Uses LLMs to semantically evaluate email content, URLs, and attachments
- Detects phishing vs. benign submissions and conveys its decision with transparent, natural language explanations
- Continuously learns from analyst feedback to refine its accuracy

### SOC Efficiency & Automation

- Resolves the majority of reported phishing emails (often >90% are false positives) automatically
- Reduces manual review workload for SOC analysts, accelerating reaction to real threats
- Integrates tightly with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and Automated Investigation and Response (AIR), which can take further remediation actions based on the agent’s output

### Transparent Reasoning and Decision-Making

- Provides step-by-step visual maps and summaries of its decisions, building trust and aiding analysts in review and investigation
- All actions and decisions are visible and configurable, maintaining organizational control and oversight

### Responsible AI and Zero Trust Implementation

- Adheres to Microsoft’s Responsible AI principles (fairness, transparency, security, privacy)
- Enforces least privilege and Zero Trust access, with administrators retaining full control over the agent’s permissions and scope
