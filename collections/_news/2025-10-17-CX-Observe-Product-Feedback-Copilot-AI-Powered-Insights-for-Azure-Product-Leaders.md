# CX Observe Product Feedback Copilot: AI-Powered Insights for Azure Product Leaders

## Introduction

The CX Observe Product Feedback Copilot, featured in the latest Microsoft Garage Wall of Fame, represents an innovative approach to leveraging artificial intelligence within Microsoft Azure product teams. Developed as part of the 2024 Microsoft Global Hackathon, this tool aims to make sense of vast quantities of customer feedback, using advanced AI techniques to extract actionable business and engineering insights.

## Tool Overview & Purpose

CX Observe is designed to help Azure product leaders identify and prioritize core customer pain points. Traditionally, customer feedback was scattered across support tickets, surveys, forums, and feature requests—making it difficult and time-consuming to analyze trends and justify investment priorities. The Copilot automates the triage and organization process, turning unstructured feedback into user stories and surfacing top customer themes by volume and urgency.

## Technical Approach

- **AI Embedding and Semantic Clustering:** The tool utilizes AI embedding to process and understand large volumes of freeform text feedback. It then applies the K-means clustering algorithm to group similar feedback, providing clear thematic organization.
- **User Story Conversion:** Raw feedback is converted into a standardized user story format, making it easier for engineering and product teams to act on insights.
- **Azure Integration:** Designed for Azure product teams and leveraging Azure infrastructure for scalability and integration.

## Development Journey

The project was born from the experience of product leader Amir Banai (longtime hacker and AI innovator) and Yoav Dobrin, who identified the challenge of actionable analytics across disparate feedback sources. Their idea quickly progressed through the Microsoft Garage Growth Framework, using resources from Garage Ventures and the Global Hackathon to iterate and validate the solution. The collaboration fostered creativity and rapid prototyping, resulting in a functional prototype.

## Business Impact

Early results showed enthusiastic adoption among Azure product leaders. The Copilot enabled:

- Immediate identification of top customer pain points
- Reduced manual triage and duplicate effort
- Data-driven justification for investments and roadmap priorities
- More strategic and customer-focused product releases

## Team & Acknowledgements

- **Core team:** Amir Banai, Yoav Dobrin
- **Mentoring/Support:** Ady Mor-Biran and the Microsoft Garage ecosystem
