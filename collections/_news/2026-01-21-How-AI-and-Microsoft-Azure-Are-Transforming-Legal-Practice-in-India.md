# How AI and Microsoft Azure Are Transforming Legal Practice in India

**Author:** stclarke

Legal professionals in India are witnessing a paradigm shift in their workflows, thanks to the integration of AI-powered tools underpinned by Microsoft Azure services. This article details how industry leaders like SCC Online and Trilegal are leveraging these technologies to address the massive backlog and operational challenges inherent to the Indian judiciary.

## SCC Online: Bringing AI to Legal Research

Sumain Malik, CEO and Director of SCC Online, oversees the pilot of an AI-driven legal research assistant built on Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search. This assistant enables lawyers and users to search for legal precedents using natural language, moving beyond traditional Boolean syntax. Supporting technologies include Azure Cosmos DB and Document Intelligence, ensuring comprehensive legal data retrieval and analysis.

- SCC Online serves over 150,000 users, impacting 75,000+ legal professionals.
- AI-driven features accelerate case preparation, reduce unnecessary appeals, and improve research quality.
- The platform provides insights across 4 million judgments and 400+ databases, significantly reducing time spent on manual searches.
- Data privacy and citation accuracy are central to SCC Online's approach; all AI-generated content is clearly sourced.

## Trilegal: AI in Legal Workflows

Trilegal, a prominent Indian law firm, integrates AI into daily workflows:

- Uses Azure OpenAI Service for bespoke knowledge management and legal research applications.
- Deploys Microsoft 365 Copilot for drafting, summarizing, and searching within the Microsoft ecosystem (not central to this analysis as per developer-tool exclusion policy).
- Utilizes Power BI for real-time insights across matters and teams.
- Maintains document security by keeping confidential data within the firm's private Azure cloud environment.
- Collaborates with startups like Lucio for tailored AI solutions covering research, drafting, and large-scale document review.

Senior associates cite significant time savings and increased opportunities for mentoring, professional development, and pro bono work as AI automates routine document processing tasks.

## Industry-Wide Impact

The deployment of AI—fueled by Microsoft Azure—extends beyond law firms into Indian courts:

- AI-powered courtroom transcription (e.g., *Adalat AI*) is now standard across 4,000+ courts, improving speed and reliability of trial records.
- AI systems facilitate the translation of judgments into 18 languages, addressing language barriers in accessing justice.
- AI tools are seen as force multipliers, enhancing legal research and supporting both lawyers and judges toward more efficient case management.

## Broader Implications

Industry voices stress that AI should support, not replace, human legal judgment. The advances described offer more equitable access to legal research and court proceedings, making the justice system more responsive for both professionals and citizens.

As India tackles a judicial backlog that may otherwise take centuries to clear, AI-enhanced solutions powered by Microsoft Azure are providing pragmatic, incremental improvements—empowering legal professionals to spend more time on higher-value tasks, mentoring, and expanding access to justice.
