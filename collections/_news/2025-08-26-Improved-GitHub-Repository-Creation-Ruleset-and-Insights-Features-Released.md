# Improved GitHub Repository Creation, Ruleset, and Insights Features Released

GitHub has announced a set of improvements now generally available across its platform:

## Streamlined Repository Creation

- The new workflow for creating repositories is designed to be faster and more intuitive.
- Clearer guidance is provided for all required fields during setup, helping users get started quickly and correctly.
- Input fields in the creation flow now respond to custom organization and enterprise policies, making it easier to adopt governance-driven rules and ensuring compliance.

## Merge Queue Bot Flexibility

- The merge queue bot can now be [added as a bypass actor for repository and organization rulesets](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/creating-rulesets-for-a-repository#granting-bypass-permissions-for-your-branch-or-tag-ruleset).
- This ensures merge queue branches (such as `gh-readonly-queue/**`) operate as expected while still enforcing update blocks for other actors.

## Repository Insights and Accessibility Updates

- The commits page in repository insights has been updated to be more accessible to screen readers.
- Commit data can now be viewed as a table or downloaded as a CSV or PNG file, making it easier for teams to analyze contribution data in their preferred format.

## Feedback

GitHub is actively seeking feedback on these enhancements; users can participate in the discussion through the [official feedback thread](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/repositories).

These updates make repository management and governance in GitHub more efficient and accessible for developers and organizations.
