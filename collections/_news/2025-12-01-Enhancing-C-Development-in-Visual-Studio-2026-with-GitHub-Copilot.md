# Enhancing C++ Development in Visual Studio 2026 with GitHub Copilot

**Author:** Erika Sweet

Visual Studio 2026 brings several new GitHub Copilot features specifically designed for C++ developers. These enhancements cover three main areas:

## 1. Large-Scale C++ Refactoring

- Advanced C++ code editing tools with Copilot integration
- Supports wide-sweeping refactors across large codebases
- Utilizes C++ IntelliSense in Visual Studio agent mode for:
  - Viewing all code references
  - Inspecting metadata (type, declaration, scope)
  - Visualizing class inheritance and function call chains
- More details: [Perform wide-sweeping refactors using C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/perform-wide-sweeping-refactors-using-c-code-editing-tools-for-github-copilot/)

## 2. Improved C++ Build Performance

- GitHub Copilot leverages Build Insights to analyze C++ builds
- Provides tailored suggestions to improve build times on Windows
- Optimizes both old and modern codebases

## 3. Upgrading MSVC Build Tools

- Copilot assists with migrating projects to the latest Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools version
- Helps identify and resolve build warnings and errors during toolchain upgrades
- Facilitates the modernization of legacy C++ applications

## Getting Started

- New Copilot C++ experiences are available as a Private Preview in Visual Studio 2026.
- [Install Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and [join the Private Preview waitlist](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WM86Y8H) to try these features.

## Feedback and Next Steps

- The Visual Studio team encourages C++ developers to explore these Copilot capabilities and provide feedback.
- Issues and suggestions about Visual Studio 2026 can be submitted through [the Developer Community](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio?view=vs-2022).
