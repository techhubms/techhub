Developers can rely on Dependabot to monitor and update OpenTofu modules, ensuring projects stay current with the latest releases and reducing manual maintenance.

## Key Points

- **Documentation:** More details on how Dependabot version updates work and how to configure them can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates).
- **About OpenTofu:** OpenTofu is an open-source alternative for managing infrastructure as code; more information is available at the [OpenTofu official website](https://opentofu.org/).
