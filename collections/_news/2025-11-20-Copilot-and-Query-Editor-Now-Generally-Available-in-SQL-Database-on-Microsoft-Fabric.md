# Copilot and Query Editor in SQL Database in Fabric (Generally Available)

At Microsoft Ignite 2025, Microsoft announced the general availability of SQL Database in Fabric, a unified data platform combining operational and analytical workloads, engineered on the trusted backbone of SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.

## Key Features and Enhancements

### Query Editor Improvements

- **Seamless Tool Integration:** Quickly open connections in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) directly from the web-based Query Editor with pre-filled connection information.
- **Bulk Query Management:** Users can now manage large lists of queries with bulk selection and deletion, improving workflow efficiency.
- **Shared Queries:** Share SQL scripts within workspaces to boost collaborative development and streamline teamwork.
- **SQL Code Snippets:** Access a growing library of ready-made T-SQL (DDL, DML, DQL) snippets for rapid script authoring and consistency.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts Pane:** Discover and learn shortcuts to navigate and execute commands efficiently, consistent with VS Code editing experience.

### Copilot AI Assistance

- **Broadened Copilot Chat Scenarios:** In addition to natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) and documentation Q&A, Copilot now provides:
  - Performance diagnosis
  - Resource usage analysis (CPU/memory)
  - Database design review (index recommendations, missing indexes)
  - Schema exploration and modification (including VECTOR columns)
  - Authoring, refactoring, and documenting T-SQL scripts
  - Interactive search and operational guidance
- **Execution Mode Selector:** Toggle between read-only and read/write modes with explicit user approval, granting control over executed DDL/DML statements. SELECT statements now auto-return results for quick data insights.

### Upcoming Features

- **Schema Designer:** Visual, interactive database schema diagrams with table editing, column definition, and key/constraint management.
- **Editable Data Grid:** Direct, Excel-like table data editing with real-time validation.
- **Copilot Inline Chat:** Contextual AI help and command execution within the SQL text editor.
