Microsoft Fabric Blog introduces ArcGIS Maps for Microsoft Fabric, an integration that brings Esri’s geospatial analytics and AI-assisted mapping to Fabric, empowering data professionals with advanced visualization and analysis tools.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Introducing ArcGIS Maps Integration with Microsoft Fabric

ArcGIS Maps for Microsoft Fabric integrates Esri’s leading geospatial technology directly into the Fabric ecosystem. This enables organizations to:

- Visualize, analyze, and share location-based data using dynamic, interactive maps
- Seamlessly integrate Esri’s ArcGIS Online service and authoritative data with Fabric data assets in OneLake
- Embed interactive geospatial visualizations into Power BI reports and organizational applications

## Key Features & Workflow

### End-to-End Integration

- **OneLake Integration**: Select and work with datasets across the organization’s OneLake data catalog for geospatial analysis.
- **Data Engineering Workflows**: Leverage Spark’s parallel processing in Fabric notebooks for large-scale geospatial analytics; processed data can be visualized and reported via ArcGIS Maps.
- **Power BI Integration**: Easily incorporate interactive maps into Power BI reports and apps for organization-wide accessibility.

### Effortless Data Onboarding

- Load data from OneLake or connect with hundreds of other sources via Fabric’s connectivity experience.
- Automatic detection of geospatial attributes or coordinate prompts to enable seamless mapping.

### Rich Visualization & Smart Mapping

- Plot geospatial distributions and add cartographic enhancements.
- Use advanced mapping features: heat maps, color ramps, clustering, binning.
- Instantly switch between visualization styles (bubbles, pins, heat maps) using UI controls.

### Advanced Analysis

- Inspect columns, view statistics, and modify fields before mapping.
- Aggregate large datasets (e.g., sales by region), dynamically update clusters and histograms, and interactively explore map features.

### Integration with ArcGIS Living Atlas & External Data

- Enhance maps with authoritative ArcGIS Living Atlas datasets or external sources.
- Example enrichments: population density, ecosystems, third-party datasets.

### AI-Powered Arcade Assistant

- Use natural language prompts through the Arcade scripting engine and a dedicated AI model to:
  - Conduct advanced analyses on web map data
  - Generate tables, summaries, and calculations without deep scripting expertise

### Performance & Security

- Handles mapping of hundreds of thousands of data points in-browser
- Utilize Spark Notebooks with GeoAnalytics libraries for preprocessing large datasets
- Share maps securely with granular access controls and consent management

## Getting Started

- Launch ArcGIS Maps from Fabric’s workload hub
- Create web map items integrated with your data assets as Fabric artifacts
