# From Awareness to Action: Building a Security-First Culture for the Agentic AI Era

Security remains a top priority for business leaders, especially as AI adoption accelerates across industries. Insights gained from Cybersecurity Awareness Month and Microsoft Ignite 2025 highlight the need for organizations to prepare for the integration of AI and intelligent agents. The Work Trend Index 2025 shows over 80% of leaders are deploying or planning to employ AI agents in the next 12–18 months.

AI introduces risks such as oversharing, data leakage, compliance gaps, and potential agent sprawl. Business and security leaders can address these issues by:

1. **Preparing for the integration of AI and agents:**
   - Establish robust governance, security, and management frameworks for AI adoption.
   - Reference the [Microsoft guide for securing the AI-powered enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/emerging-trends/ai-security-guide) for step-by-step risk management strategies.

2. **Strengthening skills and training:**
   - Focus on continuous learning and upskilling for teams managing AI tools.
   - Frontier Firms—organizations built on hybrid teams of humans and agents—emphasize human-centric security skills. The blog “[Building human-centric security skills for AI](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftlearnblog/building-human-centric-security-skills-for-ai/4137355?wt.mc_id=learnmicrosoftai_securitypaper_blog_wwl_cloud)” discusses approaches to security training.
   - Leverage [Microsoft Learn for Organizations](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/organizations?wt.mc_id=learnmicrosoftai_securitypaper_blog_wwl_cloud) and [AI Skills Navigator](https://aka.ms/ASN_SecurityBlog) for tailored security and AI resources.

> Skilling must evolve with technology. Implement an enterprise-wide strategy to ensure skill-building is aligned with changing priorities.
> —Jeana Jorgensen, Corporate Vice President, Microsoft Learning

1. **Fostering a security-first culture:**
   - Promote security awareness and responsible AI practices across all roles.
   - Make security part of daily routines and organizational norms.
   - Reference “[Cybersecurity Awareness Month: Security starts with you](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/10/01/cybersecurity-awareness-month-security-starts-with-you/)” by Vasu Jakkal for more on embedding security.
   - Download the e-book, [Skilling for Secure AI: How Frontier Firms Lead the Way](https://aka.ms/SkillingForSecureAI_cloud), for actionable steps to enhance identity management and data governance.

## Practical Steps

Organizations can maximize their AI investments and reduce risks by:

- Sharing the [Be Cybersmart Kit](https://aka.ms/becybersmartkit) with employees for tips on safe AI usage and fraud protection.
- Investing in upskilling initiatives for secure cloud and AI transformation.
- Ensuring cybersecurity is integral to all business strategies.
