Allison reports on GitHub's update that increases enterprise teams product limits by over 10x, enabling greater scalability and streamlined access management for organizations.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Enterprise Teams Product Limits Increased by Over 10x

**Author:** Allison

GitHub has significantly raised the limits for enterprise teams in the public preview for Enterprise Cloud customers:

- **Up to 2,500 enterprise teams** per enterprise (previous limit: 100)
- **Up to 5,000 users** per enterprise team (previous limit: 500)
- Teams remain assignable across **1,000 organizations** within an enterprise

These new limits empower large organizations to better manage user access, governance, and licensing—including Copilot licensing—at scale. The feature remains in public preview and is anticipated to become available for Enterprise Server customers in release 3.20.

For more details, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/concepts/enterprise-fundamentals/teams-in-an-enterprise).

*Please note: Features in public preview may have UI or functionality changes before final release.*
