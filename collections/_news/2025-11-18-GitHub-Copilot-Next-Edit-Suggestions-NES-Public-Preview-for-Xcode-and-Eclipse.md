# GitHub Copilot Next Edit Suggestions (NES) Public Preview for Xcode and Eclipse

GitHub Copilot's new **Next Edit Suggestions (NES)** feature is now available in public preview for both **Xcode** and **Eclipse**. NES leverages the current context of your code to suggest the next logical edit, aiming to reduce repetitive developer tasks and improve productivity.

## What is NES?

NES analyzes your latest edits to anticipate further changes you might wish to make—across code, comments, and tests. This means Copilot can now recommend:

- Code revisions
- Comment updates
- Test changes
- Other relevant enhancements

Suggestions can be previewed and applied instantly, helping maintain an uninterrupted workflow. You can navigate through these suggestions using Tab, and accept them just as easily.

## How to Get Started

1. **Update Your IDE**:
   - For Xcode: [Download the latest Copilot for Xcode](https://github.com/github/copilotforXcode/).
   - For Eclipse: [Get Copilot from the Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/github-copilot).
2. **Ensure you have a valid [Copilot license](https://github.com/features/copilot).**
3. **Enable NES in Your IDE Settings**:
   - **Xcode**: Open the Copilot for Xcode app → Advanced → Suggestion Settings → Enable Next Edit Suggestions (NES).
   - **Eclipse**: Click Copilot icon → Edit Preferences → Completion section → Enable Next Edit Suggestions (NES).
4. **Start Coding**: NES suggestions appear automatically as you code. Use Tab or arrow in the gutter menu to accept or apply changes.
