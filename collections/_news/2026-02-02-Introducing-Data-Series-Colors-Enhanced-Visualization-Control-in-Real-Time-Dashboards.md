# Introducing Data Series Colors: tell clearer stories with Real-Time Dashboards (Generally Available)

Microsoft Fabric Blog presents a highly requested enhancement to Real-Time Dashboards: **Data Series Colors**. This new capability allows dashboard editors to directly assign and control colors for individual data series across multiple chart types, including pie, time, line, area, bar, column, anomaly, and scatter charts.

## Key Features

- **Direct Color Assignment:** Assign colors for each data series rather than relying on automatic defaults.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a unified color scheme across multiple visuals and dashboards, reinforcing common meanings and patterns.
- **Enhanced Communication:** Use colors intentionally to communicate context, trends, and operational status at a glance—without requiring legends or extensive labels.
- **Supported Visualization Types:** Works with the most popular visuals, such as pie, bar, column, line, area, anomaly, and scatter charts.

## Operational and Reporting Benefits

- **Clarity:** Colors signify specific meanings, enabling instant understanding of spikes, drops, and patterns in your data.
- **Consistency Across Teams:** Shared color conventions reinforce understanding across different users and teams.
- **Storytelling:** Dashboards become tools for presenting clear narratives, with visuals that emphasize what matters most.

## Visual Examples

- Screenshot examples demonstrate customizable color options in the dashboard's visual setting pane.
- Adjusted colors reflect specific states and operational highlights, improving interpretation speed.
