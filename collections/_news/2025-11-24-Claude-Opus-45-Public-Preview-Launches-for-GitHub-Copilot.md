# Claude Opus 4.5 Public Preview Launches for GitHub Copilot

Claude Opus 4.5, Anthropic’s newest AI model, is now rolling out to GitHub Copilot users. Initial testing shows that this model not only surpasses previous internal coding benchmarks but also cuts token usage by half, making it ideal for developers eager to accelerate their workflows.

## Availability and Plans

Claude Opus 4.5 is available on the following Copilot plans:

- Pro
- Pro+
- Business
- Enterprise

During the promotional period (until December 5, 2025), the model is priced at a promotional 1x premium request multiplier. More information can be found on the [Copilot plans page](https://github.com/features/copilot/plans?utm_source=changelog-opus-45-copilot-plans-cta&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=dec25postuniverse).

## How to Enable the Model

- **Enterprise & Business Plans:** Admins must enable the Claude Opus 4.5 policy in Copilot settings.
- **Pro & Pro+ Plans:** Users on VS Code should use the model picker and confirm the activation with a one-time prompt.

## Supported Platforms

Claude Opus 4.5 can be selected in:

- Copilot Chat (VS Code: Agent, Plan, Ask, and Edit mode)
- Copilot Chat on [github.com](https://github.com)
- Copilot Chat in GitHub Mobile apps (iOS and Android)
- Copilot CLI

The rollout is gradual—users who do not see the model available should check back soon. When enabled, Claude Opus 4.5 will serve as the default model for Copilot coding agent.

## Additional Guidance
