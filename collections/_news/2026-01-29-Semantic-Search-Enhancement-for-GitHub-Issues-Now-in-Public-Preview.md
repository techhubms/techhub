# Semantic Search Enhancement for GitHub Issues Now in Public Preview

GitHub has released an improved search experience for Issues, leveraging a new semantic index. This update allows users to search using natural language (e.g., “authentication failing on mobile”), and find conceptually relevant issues, regardless of whether the exact keywords appear in issue titles or descriptions.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search:** Users can enter descriptive, natural language queries and receive contextually relevant issues—even if different wording is used.
- **Improved Relevance:** Internal testing shows search results are now on average 39% better with semantic search, quickly surfacing the most pertinent issues.
- **Automatic Best Match Ordering:** Issue lists are now automatically sorted by “Best match” to prioritize relevant results.
- **Fallback to Lexical Search:** Exact matches (e.g., using quotation marks) still employ traditional keyword search for precision queries.
- **Opt-out Preview:** During the public preview phase, users can opt out via the [feature preview dialog](https://docs.github.com/get-started/using-github/exploring-early-access-releases-with-feature-preview).

## How to Use It

- Navigate to any repository's **Issues** tab and search using natural language.
- Share feedback in [the GitHub community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/185760).

## Additional Improvements and Bug Fixes

- Resolved slow performance when searching for labels on Edge and Safari browsers.
- Fixed a scrolling bug on Safari that affected GitHub Issues usability.
- Improved and standardized milestone ordering for both open and closed issues.
