[Esri](https://www.esri.com/) is a global market leader in GIS technology and mapping through its primary product, ArcGIS. Leveraging a new partnership, Microsoft and Esri have brought advanced spatial analytics features directly into Microsoft Fabric, now generally available for production usage.

## Key Features of ArcGIS GeoAnalytics for Microsoft Fabric Spark

- **Native Integration**: Esri's geospatial analytics tools are built directly into Fabric Spark notebooks and jobs, making it easy for Spark developers and data scientists to perform advanced spatial analysis without additional setup.
- **Comprehensive Geospatial Capabilities**: The integration includes:
  - **Data engineering and transformations** in Spark-powered Data Science or Data Engineering notebooks or as part of Data Factory pipelines.
  - **Hotspot and clustering analysis** to highlight statistically significant spatial clusters (e.g., high/low value areas, outliers, similarity groupings).
  - **Spatial pattern identification**, allowing feature and distribution analysis across timespans or geographies.
  - **Spatial joins for data enrichment and analytics**, bringing context via proximity-based enrichment.
  - **Track and movement analysis** for GPS or similar data, revealing incident patterns, motion statistics, and location changes over time.
  - **Aggregation for Power BI**: Results can be written to OneLake and surfaced in Power BI dashboards or incorporated into scheduled automated workflows.

- **Seamless Data Science Workflows**: Integrate geospatial analysis into broader data engineering, enrichment, and reporting workflows in Fabric.

## Leveraging ArcGIS in Power BI

Alongside Fabric Spark integration, the [ArcGIS for Power BI](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/microsoft-365/latest/power-bi/get-started-with-arcgis-for-power-bi.htm) solution lets organizations enhance dashboards and reports with spatial insights and custom data visualizations.
