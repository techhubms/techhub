Microsoft Fabric Blog demonstrates how organizations can leverage SQL database in Fabric to unify transactional data for analytics and AI. Copilot integrations, automation, developer tooling, and open data formats are core highlights of this in-depth overview.<!--excerpt_end-->

# SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric: SaaS-Native, AI-Ready Platform

Microsoft Fabric's SQL database, now generally available, offers organizations a streamlined path from transactional operations to powerful analytics and AI workflows—all without infrastructure management.

## Overview

- **SaaS-native:** Instantly provision new databases; autoscaling and auto pausing are built-in
- **T-SQL Compatible:** Built on the same engine as Azure SQL Database, supporting familiar tools and syntax
- **Infrastructure-Free:** No ETL required as operational data is mirrored to OneLake in Delta table format

## Seamless Analytics and ML Integration

- **Data Mirroring:** SQL database automatically replicates data to OneLake as Delta tables in near real-time
- **AI and ML Ready:** Data scientists can access Delta tables directly from Spark, use Fabric notebooks for experiments, and integrate with tools for machine learning and real-time intelligence
- **Semantic and Vector Support:** Native vector types and indexing enable semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns
- **Copilot Integration:** Copilot is embedded in the Query Editor and SQL analytics endpoint for natural language querying, schema exploration, code explanation, and performance troubleshooting

## Enterprise and Developer Capabilities

- **Enterprise Features:** Row-level security, customer-managed keys, private endpoints, customizable backups, retention policies, and SQL auditing
- **Developer Tooling:** Compatible with SQL Server Management Studio 22, VS Code (with Fabric browsing and GitHub Copilot integration), and the Fabric portal's web-based Query Editor
- **Automation & CI/CD:** SqlPackage for import/export, SQL project source control, support for Terraform and Fabric CLI

## Community and Events

- **Support:** Access forums and participate in ideas voting on Fabric's SQL database
- **Events:** Join SQLCon at FabCon Atlanta for deep technical dives and product team engagement
- **Ongoing Education:** Subscribe to the Azure SQL YouTube channel for tutorials and community updates
