# Let’s Learn MCP Series Recap: 8 Languages, 4 Code Bases, Full Resources

*By Katie Savage*

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming the core standard for connecting AI agents to a wide variety of external tools and services. Within a few months, MCP has gained significant traction, with a rising presence at developer events and growing adoption from organizations large and small.

To help meet the demand for accessible training, Microsoft launched a beginner-friendly series of MCP training events. If you missed these, they are available on-demand, along with full resource links and code repositories to help you get started.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol for establishing seamless communication between AI agents and external systems such as APIs or databases. It is designed to simplify integration and enables developers to build robust, cross-platform AI solutions.

## Using and Building with MCP

The sessions provided:

- **Overview of MCP fundamentals**
- **Guides for using an MCP server in your applications**
