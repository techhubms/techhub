# Join the OSS AI Summit: Building with LangChain Event

**Date:** December 10, 2025, 8 am – 10 am Pacific  
[Register Here](https://aka.ms/OSSAISummitRegistration)

## Overview

AI development is accelerating, and building reliable, scalable agent-based applications requires understanding cutting-edge tools and workflows. This summit brings together Microsoft and LangChain experts to walk through real-world projects utilizing LangChain v1, Microsoft Foundry, Azure OpenAI, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Participants will learn about:

- Agent design fundamentals and orchestration with LangChain v1 (Python & JavaScript)
- Building single and multi-agent systems that interact with live data and external tools
- Integrating agents with Microsoft cloud infrastructure, Azure OpenAI, and MCP
- Practical production lessons from engineers and business leaders

## Key Event Sessions

- **LangChain v1 Explained:** Learn how LangChain components work together for robust agent workflows in both Python and JavaScript.
- **Fireside Chat:** Experts share real-world agent use cases, failures, and lessons learned in production settings.
- **Python Agents in Action:** Walkthrough of an AI sales analysis agent leveraging LangChain, Azure OpenAI, and PostgreSQL.
- **MCP in Action:** How to build modern agent workflows with LangChain.js, granting agents secure access to external systems and data.
- **Inside LangChain Q&A:** Ask questions directly to the developers behind LangChain.

## Featured Projects

- **AI Sales Analyst:** A sales chatbot built with LangChain, Azure OpenAI, and MCP (Python). It connects to a PostgreSQL database and integrates OpenAI’s API for web search, image generation, and code execution. Find the sample [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/langchain-agent-python).

- **AI Travel Agents:** A reference app simulating a travel agency using multiple AI agents. Utilizes LangChain.js, multiple MCP servers (Python, Node.js/TypeScript, Java, .NET), and deploys on Azure Container Apps, monitored with OpenTelemetry. See the code [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ai-travel-agents).

- **MCP Agent with LangChain.js:** Demonstrates a full-stack AI agent ordering system using LangChain.js, Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, and serverless APIs. Check it out [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/mcp-agent-langchainjs).

## Why Attend?

Attending the OSS AI Summit immerses you in the forefront of AI agent development using Microsoft and open-source technologies. Gain hands-on insights from the teams building these systems and learn how to ship smarter, more reliable agent applications for the future.
