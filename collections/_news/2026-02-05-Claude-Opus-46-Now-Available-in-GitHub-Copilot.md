# Claude Opus 4.6 Now Available in GitHub Copilot

Allison announces that Claude Opus 4.6, Anthropic’s latest AI model, is now being gradually rolled out to GitHub Copilot. Early testing reports that Claude Opus 4.6 excels in agentic coding scenarios, particularly with challenging tasks that require planning and tool utilization.

## Availability

Claude Opus 4.6 will be accessible to users on Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise subscription plans. The model can be selected in the model picker across these platforms and interfaces:

- Visual Studio Code (all modes: chat, ask, edit, agent)
- Visual Studio (agent and ask modes)
- github.com
- GitHub Mobile (iOS and Android)
- GitHub CLI
- GitHub Copilot coding agent (Pro/Pro+ accounts only)

The rollout is staged, so not all users will see the option immediately.

## Enabling Claude Opus 4.6

For organizations, Copilot Enterprise and Business plan administrators must enable the Claude Opus 4.6 policy in Copilot settings to grant access to users.
