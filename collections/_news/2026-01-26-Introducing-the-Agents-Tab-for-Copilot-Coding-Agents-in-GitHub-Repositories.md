# Introducing the Agents Tab for Copilot Coding Agents in GitHub Repositories

GitHub has unveiled the new **Agents** tab, transforming how developers manage Copilot coding agent tasks within repositories. This feature brings a mission control-style interface to each repository, directly alongside code, issues, and pull requests, eliminating the need to navigate to external pages.

## Unified Agent Management

- **Centralized Sessions:** All agent sessions related to the repository are now accessible in a single location.
- **Seamless Task Handling:** Easily create new agent tasks, switch between active sessions, and archive sessions for better organization.
- **Quick Navigation:** One-click links allow instant access to associated pull requests, streamlining the review process.

## Redesigned Session Logs

- **Improved Readability:** Sessions now display grouped tool calls, reducing visual noise and highlighting the flow of actions.
- **Inline Previews:** Tool outputs appear as inline previews, and file changes use expandable diff views familiar to developers.
- **Enhanced Transparency:** Each tool call features distinctive icons, and bash commands are visible for clear traceability and auditability.

## Copilot CLI Integration

- **Resume Work in Terminal:** Developers can continue ongoing Copilot agent sessions directly in the Copilot CLI.
- **Quick Start:** Simply click **Continue in Copilot CLI**, copy the suggested command, and paste it into your terminal to resume your workflow seamlessly.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the new **Agents** tab.
3. Initiate a task or agent session.
4. To move your session to the terminal, click **Continue in Copilot CLI** and follow the provided instructions.
5. Ensure Copilot coding agent is enabled for your repository by reviewing [access management documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/access-management).

For direct CLI setup, visit the [Copilot CLI installation guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/set-up/install-copilot-cli).
