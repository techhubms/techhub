# L&G Reinvents Customer Care with AI-Powered Microsoft Platform

## Overview

Legal & General (L&G), a longstanding UK financial services provider, has embarked on a multi-year collaboration with Microsoft to unify and enhance its customer service technology. By consolidating legacy systems into a single AI-powered platform, L&G is simplifying the experience for 2,800 employees and more than 12 million customers.

## The Solution: Microsoft-Powered Customer Service

- **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Centre** forms the core of the new customer care infrastructure, bringing together data from previously isolated product lines.
- The initiative provides a real-time, complete view of each customer's relationship with the business, reducing the need for staff to manually coordinate across multiple platforms.
- **Microsoft Copilot** is deeply integrated to automate routine tasks such as call transcription, case summaries, and process suggestions.

> “This is about giving our people one view of the customer... that lets them focus on understanding, not just processing.” — Craig Brown, Chief Operating Officer, Retail

## Human-Centered AI

- The design ensures AI operates in the background: aiding, rather than replacing, human staff.
- Administrative tasks are handled by the system, allowing colleagues to devote more attention to empathetic, meaningful conversations—critical in sensitive financial matters.

## Intelligent Analytics and Insights

- Built-in AI analyzes tone, sentiment, and emerging themes in customer interactions.
- Summarized insights from thousands of calls help L&G refine processes, improve products, and identify points of friction.
- Continuous feedback loops allow for rapid adaptation and smarter decision-making.

## Data Security and Compliance

- Customer data security and privacy are emphasized throughout.
- The system is governed by strict protocols, keeping data protection as a top priority.
- AI solutions are implemented with transparency and human oversight.

## Scalable, Future-Proofed Infrastructure

- The platform operates within L&G's existing Microsoft ecosystem, leveraging Azure and Power Platform for scalability and consistency.
- Ongoing collaboration with Microsoft ensures the solution evolves to meet the demands of a growing customer base.

## Project Stages and Outlook

- The first phase targets workplace savings, retail protection, and annuities.
- Each subsequent stage will extend functionalities to new teams and products.
- L&G aims for a fundamental shift in operations, raising customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## Key Takeaways

- AI, used thoughtfully, can simplify and humanize customer service at large scale.
- Unified platforms eliminate manual, error-prone processes, freeing staff for strategic, value-added work.
- Partnering with trusted technology vendors like Microsoft supports robust, compliant digital transformation.
