# GitHub Copilot Policy Adds Agent Mode Controls for IDE

GitHub has introduced a new enhancement for enterprise and organization administrators: the ability to manage Copilot agent mode access in the IDE via policy controls available on github.com.

## What's Changed

Previously, Copilot agent mode in IDEs was automatically enabled for all users within an organization. With the latest update, administrators have granular control over this setting using the **Copilot policies** page or the **AI Controls** tab.

- **Default Behavior:**
  - The new agent mode policy is shipped as *Enabled* by default to prevent disruption to existing workflows.
- **Policy Management:**
  - Administrators can now enable or disable agent mode access for all users in their GitHub organization or enterprise from a centralized location.
- **Access Points:**
  - For enterprises, head to the **AI Controls** tab.
  - For organizations, use the **Copilot policies** tab.

## Rationale

This update provides improved governance for organizations making use of Copilot in regulated or controlled environments. It helps admins ensure Copilot agent mode aligns with internal policies and compliance requirements.

## Further Information

- Documentation: [Manage enterprise Copilot policies](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/manage-enterprise-policies)
- Feedback opportunities are highlighted in the documentation.

Administrators using GitHub Copilot in professional or regulated development settings now have greater ability to control the Copilot experience for their teams.
