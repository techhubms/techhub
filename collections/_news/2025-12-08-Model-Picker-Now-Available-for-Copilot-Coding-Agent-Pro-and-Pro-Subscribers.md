# Model Picker Now Available for Copilot Coding Agent (Pro and Pro+ Subscribers)

GitHub has introduced a model picker feature for the Copilot coding agent, now accessible to Copilot Pro and Pro+ subscribers. This asynchronous, autonomous agent can be used from the agents tab, agents panel, issue assignments on github.com, or through the Raycast extension.

## Key Features

- **Model Selection**: Users can now select between multiple advanced AI models while initiating a task:
  - Auto (system-optimized selection)
  - Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5
  - Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5
  - OpenAI GPT-5.1-Codex-Max
- **Auto Option**: If 'Auto' is selected, Copilot will optimize for speed and performance by dynamically choosing a model based on availability.
- **Eligibility**: Currently available for Copilot Pro and Pro+ subscribers. Expansion to Copilot Business and Enterprise subscribers is planned.
- **Integrations**: Model picker will soon be available in more integrations, such as:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-copilot-chat-in-visual-studio-code)
  - [GitHub Mobile](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/create-a-pr#asking-copilot-to-create-a-pull-request-from-github-mobile)

## How to Use the Model Picker

- When starting a task via Copilot coding agent-enabled interfaces, look for the model picker dropdown.
- Choose one of the supported models or leave on **Auto** for Copilot to decide.

## Documentation

For setup and usage details, refer to official [documentation about model selection in Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/changing-the-ai-model).
