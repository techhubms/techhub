# What the Fastest-Growing Tools Reveal About Modern Software Development

_By Dylan Birtolo_

In 2025, software development reached a pivotal point, as highlighted in [GitHub's Octoverse report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/). Growth in programming languages, tools, and open source projects shows a shift—developers aren't simply looking to ship more code, they're focused on reducing friction, especially as AI becomes a routine part of daily coding.

## TypeScript Rises to #1

In August 2025, [TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript on GitHub](https://github.blog/developer-skills/programming-languages-and-frameworks/7-learnings-from-anders-hejlsberg-the-architect-behind-c-and-typescript/) to become the most used language, adding over a million contributors. Python also saw significant gains (+850,000 contributors), while JavaScript's growth slowed comparatively.

This isn't just a change in preference. AI-assisted development led to a greater need for strongly typed languages like TypeScript, as they provide guardrails for catching errors early and enable developers to reason better about AI-generated code. For both new projects and teams bringing AI into existing codebases, adopting or strengthening type systems is recommended.

**Takeaways:**

- For new projects in an AI-heavy world, TypeScript is a strong default.
- Introducing types to JavaScript codebases can improve AI-driven collaboration and reduce errors.

## Python's Role in AI

AI-focused repositories predominantly use Python. As of August 2025, nearly half of new AI projects on GitHub are Python-based. Python's flexibility and ecosystem make it ideal for training, inference, orchestration, and moving AI systems from experimentation to production.

**Key trends:**

- Python is essential for modern AI development, including infrastructure and tooling.
- Production skills (packaging, typing, CI/CD, containerization) are increasingly valued over exploratory scripting in Python.

## The Fastest-Growing Open Source Projects

The most rapidly growing projects prioritize performance, reproducibility, and developer control. Examples include [astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python package management, which exemplifies the move toward faster iteration and stable environments—both critical for AI-driven workflows.

**Emerging trends:**

- Fast installs and reproducible builds are now as important as new features.
- Tools that resolve environment inconsistencies are winning widespread adoption.

## First-Time Contributors and Open Source Hygiene

Projects like [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) and [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) continue to attract new open source contributors. Clear documentation, contributor guides, and codes of conduct are top differentiators in converting curiosity into engagement.

**Advice for maintainers:**

- Invest in documentation and contribution guidelines to lower the barrier for first-timers.
- Improved project hygiene is often the fastest path to a larger contributor base.

## Conclusion: AI Changes Everything

AI is no longer a separate class of development—it shapes language choice, popular tools, and open source dynamics. Strongly typed languages like TypeScript are prized for reliability, Python is the foundation for AI projects, and speed/reproducibility are core tenets. Developers optimizing for clarity, reliability, and fast feedback are setting the standard for how modern software gets built.
