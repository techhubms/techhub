# Public Preview: Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) for GitHub Copilot Chat in JetBrains and Xcode

GitHub Copilot Chat has introduced Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) support in public preview for JetBrains IDEs and Xcode. This feature lets developers connect their own API keys from a range of supported model providers, including Azure, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq, and OpenRouter.

## What Does BYOK Unlock?

- **Model flexibility:** Access and use a broader selection of language models beyond the default Copilot offering.
- **Experimentation:** Easily try out new models and their unique features without waiting for official Copilot integration.
- **Greater control:** Select preferred providers, enjoy fewer limitations on rate-limiting or usage policies, and tailor your Copilot Chat experience to specific needs.

## How to Try BYOK in JetBrains IDEs

1. Install the latest [GitHub Copilot plugin for JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot).
2. Open Copilot Chat and click **Manage Models** in the model picker.
3. Choose your provider and select **Add Models**.
4. Enter your API key and related details, then click **Save**.
5. Select models under your key and enable them in the model picker.

## How to Try BYOK in Xcode

1. Install the latest [GitHub Copilot for Xcode plugin](https://github.com/github/CopilotForXcode).
2. Open Copilot Chat and pick **Manage Models** from the model picker.
3. Choose your preferred provider (including Azure and OpenAI).
4. Enter your API key and endpoint URL if required.
5. Click **Add** to complete setup. Enabled models appear in the “Model Settings” page for use in Copilot Chat.
