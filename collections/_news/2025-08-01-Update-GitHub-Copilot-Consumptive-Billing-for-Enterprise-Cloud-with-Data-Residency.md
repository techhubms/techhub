## Update on GitHub Copilot Consumptive Billing for GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency

**Author:** Allison

### Overview

GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers who utilize data residency and have a paid GitHub Copilot plan will now encounter consumptive billing for premium request usage. This change primarily affects organizations using Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise plans.

---

### What's Changed

- **Consumptive Billing Expansion:**
  - GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC) users with data residency and a Copilot plan now have a monthly allowance of premium Copilot requests per user.
  - If premium request usage exceeds the monthly allowance, customers will incur additional charges. The amount charged depends on the premium models and features used.

### What's Unchanged

- This change only expands consumptive billing to data residency users on GHEC.
- The terms, details, and management of premium requests otherwise remain the same as previously documented.

---

### Further Information

- **Premium Requests Documentation:**
  - Full details are provided in GitHub's [Copilot billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests).
