# Simplified Copilot Model Enablement for GitHub Users

GitHub has released an update for Copilot Pro+, Pro, and Free users aimed at simplifying access to the latest AI models across all Copilot features. With this rollout, new models become available instantly in Copilot, eliminating the need for users to navigate settings or manage policies to enable them.

## Key Improvements

- **Immediate Access:** Newly released AI models are now accessible in Copilot features as soon as they're available, without needing to visit settings.
- **Flexible Model Selection:** Users can select their preferred model manually or let GitHub automatically choose the best one with Auto mode enabled.
- **Seamless Integration:** Once a model is selected, it works immediately—streamlining the development process.
- **Consistent Data Usage Policies:** All existing data-usage policies remain unchanged and continue to protect your privacy and data.

> “This update reduces friction and removes ambiguity around model availability, all while preserving your ability to decide which models you use and when.”

The update is rolling out over the next day. Users who do not see the changes immediately are encouraged to check back soon.
