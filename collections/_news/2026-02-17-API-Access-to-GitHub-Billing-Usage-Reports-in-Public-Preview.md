# API Access to GitHub Billing Usage Reports in Public Preview

GitHub has introduced new REST API endpoints for enterprise administrators to request and download billing usage reports in `.csv` format. This enhancement enables programmatic access to the same billing reports previously available only through the GitHub UI, streamlining billing management and reporting workflows.

## Key Features

- **Programmatic Billing Reports**: Enterprise billing usage reports can now be accessed via API, supporting integration with custom administrative tools and automation pipelines.
- **Format and Access**: Reports are downloadable in CSV format, mirroring the UI-based downloads.
- **Documentation**: Detailed usage instructions and API endpoint documentation are available in the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/reference/billing-reports#report-types).
- **Feedback and Discussion**: For feedback or questions, administrators can join the [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186162).

## Implications for Enterprises

- Enables deeper automation for enterprise finance and IT teams
- Simplifies large-scale usage data collection and integration with internal systems
- Aligns with best practices in DevOps and enterprise management

## How to Get Started

1. Review the [API documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/billing/reference/billing-reports#report-types).
2. Use the REST endpoints to initiate billing report generation and download, as described in the docs.
3. Integrate the API calls into your automation workflows and reporting systems.
4. Participate in ongoing community discussions to share feedback and suggestions.
