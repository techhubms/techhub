# Microsoft Expands Azure Cloud and AI Infrastructure Across the United States

Microsoft is making significant strides in expanding its Azure cloud and AI infrastructure to meet growing customer demand in the United States. Recent and planned datacenter expansions, including the new **East US 3** region in Greater Atlanta and enhancements to existing regions, reflect a commitment to providing robust, resilient, and sustainable cloud services.

## Key Announcements

- **Launch of East US 3 Region (Greater Atlanta, 2027):**
  - Designed for advanced Azure workloads and security needs.
  - Incorporates Availability Zones for increased resilience.
  - Built with sustainability in mind, targeting LEED Gold certification and responsible water management.
- **Expansion of Existing Regions:**
  - Availability Zones are being added to North Central US, West Central US, US Gov Arizona, East US 2 (Virginia), and South Central US (Texas).
  - Enhancements provide increased capacity, flexibility, and disaster recovery options for customers with multi-region architectures.

## Infrastructure and Technical Features

- **Global Scope:** Microsoft Azure now encompasses 70+ regions, 400+ data centers, and 190+ edge sites, interconnected by a massive global fiber network.
- **Availability Zones:** Unique physical datacenter sites with independent power, networking, and cooling allow for zone-redundant architectures, minimizing service interruptions and data loss.
- **Sustainability Commitments:** Datacenters adhere to Microsoft’s carbon, water, and waste reduction goals, including LEED certification and water conservation strategies.

## Customer and Real-World Use Cases

- **University of Miami:** Leveraged Azure Availability Zones for disaster recovery in a hurricane-prone area, shifting critical assets to the cloud for improved reliability and agility.
- **State of Alaska:** Improved operational resiliency and reduced costs by migrating legacy systems to Azure, consolidating infrastructure statewide.

## Support for Government and Regulated Environments

- **Azure Government Expansion:**
  - Addition of Availability Zones in US Gov Arizona supports segmented, resilient architectures for federal agencies.
  - Infrastructure aligns with CMMC and NIST requirements for compliance and mission-critical workloads.
- **New Azure for US Government Secret region** supports secure, high-compliance deployments.

## Tools and Guidance

- **Cloud Adoption Framework:** Helps organizations adopt best practices for cloud migration and management.
- **Well-Architected Framework:** Provides technical guidance for building reliable, secure, and high-performance solutions on Azure.
