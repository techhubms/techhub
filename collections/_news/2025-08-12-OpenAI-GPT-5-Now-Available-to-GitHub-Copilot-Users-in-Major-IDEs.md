# OpenAI GPT-5 Now Available to GitHub Copilot Users in Major IDEs

OpenAI's GPT-5, the latest frontier model, is now in public preview for GitHub Copilot users across a broad set of integrated development environments. This release aims to enhance the developer experience with improved reasoning, code quality, and intelligent coding assistance.

## Key Features and Improvements

- **Advanced model**: GPT-5 delivers significant improvements over its predecessors, especially in reasoning capabilities and code generation.
- **Complex coding tasks**: Handles sophisticated end-to-end programming scenarios and large implementations with minimal user input.
- **Transparency**: Offers clear explanations of its code suggestions and decision-making process.
- **Agentic capabilities**: Functions as a collaborative coding assistant, proactively supporting developers throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Availability and Supported Environments

- **Rollout details**: GPT-5 is rolling out to all paid GitHub Copilot plans.
- **Supported platforms**:
  - GitHub Copilot Chat on [github.com](https://github.com)
  - GitHub Mobile
  - Visual Studio
  - VS Code
  - JetBrains IDEs
  - Xcode
  - Eclipse
- **Model selection**: Access GPT-5 in the Copilot chat model picker, available in 'Agent', 'Ask', and 'Edit' modes.

## How to Enable GPT-5

- **Enterprise and Business accounts**: Admins must enable the new GPT-5 policy within Copilot settings before users in the organization can access the model.
- **Individual users**: If GPT-5 is not yet visible, users are advised to check back periodically as the rollout continues.
