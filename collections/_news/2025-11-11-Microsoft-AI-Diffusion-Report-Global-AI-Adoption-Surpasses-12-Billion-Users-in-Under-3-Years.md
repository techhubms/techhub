# Microsoft AI Diffusion Report: Global AI Adoption Surpasses 1.2 Billion Users in Under 3 Years

Microsoft's inaugural [AI Diffusion Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/aiei/ai-diffusion/) provides a comprehensive look at the accelerating pace of artificial intelligence adoption worldwide. In less than three years, over 1.2 billion people have used AI tools—a rate of technology uptake that exceeds previous milestones, such as the spread of the internet, personal computers, or smartphones.

## Key Findings

- **Rapid AI Adoption:** More than 1.2 billion global users adopted AI tools in under three years, making AI one of the fastest-spreading general-purpose technologies.
- **Global Disparities:** While adoption is highest where connectivity and digital infrastructure are strong, nearly four billion people lack basic access to participate in the AI-driven economy.

## The Indices: Measuring AI Progress

The report introduces three analytical indices:

- **AI Frontier Index:** Tracks where AI breakthroughs and innovations are emerging globally.
- **AI Infrastructure Index:** Assesses countries' capacities to support scaling and deployment of AI systems.
- **AI Diffusion Index:** Measures the practical use and integration of AI tools in daily life, business, and society.

## Policy and Infrastructure Implications

- The report highlights the urgent need to bridge existing digital divides by improving access to digital infrastructure and fostering skills development.
- Equitable access is emphasized as critical to ensure the opportunities of AI benefit a broad population, not just those in well-connected regions.
- The findings encourage governments and organizations to invest in responsible AI policies and foundational digital infrastructure.
