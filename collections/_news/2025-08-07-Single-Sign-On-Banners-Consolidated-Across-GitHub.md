Allison details GitHub's new consolidated single sign-on banner experience, highlighting how it streamlines SSO notifications for organization members and improves account management.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Single Sign-On Banners Consolidated Across GitHub

**Overview**

GitHub has released an update aimed at improving the experience for users who belong to organizations that require single sign-on (SSO) authentication. Previously, such users encountered multiple, inconsistent banners across various pages, which led to notification overload and clutter. The latest change consolidates these messages into one unified, dismissible banner.

**What's New**

- **Unified SSO Banner:** Replaces multiple SSO banners with a single, clear, dismissible notification on relevant pages.
- **Smart Dismissal:** The new banner can be dismissed, and will only reappear if the SSO status changes—such as logging out or joining a new SSO-required organization.
- **Enhanced SSO Information:** SSO status and details are now easily accessible in the [SSO & Organizations](https://github.com/settings/organizations) tab within the user's settings.

**How to Provide Feedback**

GitHub encourages users to share suggestions or issues regarding the new SSO experience by commenting in their [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169115).
