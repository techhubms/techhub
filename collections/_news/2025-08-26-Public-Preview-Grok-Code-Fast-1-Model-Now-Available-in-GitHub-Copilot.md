# Grok Code Fast 1 Now Rolling Out for GitHub Copilot

GitHub is rolling out Grok Code Fast 1 as an opt-in public preview for GitHub Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise plans in Visual Studio Code. The rollout is gradual, so users who don't see it yet should check back soon.

## Availability and Access

- **Plans Supported**: Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise can access Grok Code Fast 1 in Visual Studio Code.
- **Gradual Rollout**: The new model is being released in phases, so it may not appear immediately for everyone.

## xAI Model Access with BYOK

- **Individual Plans**: xAI models, including Grok Code Fast 1, are available to Copilot individual plan users via Bring Your Own Key (BYOK). This requires providing your own xAI API key.

## How to Enable Grok Code Fast 1

- **For Business/Enterprise Plans**: An administrator must enable the Grok Code Fast 1 policy in Copilot settings. Once enabled, all organization users can select the model within the Visual Studio Code model picker.
- **For Individual Paid Plans**: Simply choose Grok Code Fast 1 from the model picker in Visual Studio Code and complete the one-time prompt.
- **BYOK Access**: Select **Manage Models** in the Visual Studio Code model picker, choose **xAI**, enter your API key, and then select **Grok Code Fast 1**.

## Complimentary Access Details

- Users can access Grok Code Fast 1 (except with BYOK) for free until 2 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, September 2, 2025.
