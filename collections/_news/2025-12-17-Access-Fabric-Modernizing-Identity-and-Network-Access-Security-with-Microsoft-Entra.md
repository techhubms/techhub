# Access Fabric: Modernizing Identity and Network Access Security with Microsoft Entra

*By Igor Sakhnov*

Organizations today often manage multiple identity systems and network solutions, leading to fragmented security. This fragmentation leaves gaps that cyberattackers—especially those leveraging AI—can exploit.

## The Challenge of Fragmented Access Security

- Multiple identity and network solutions from different vendors create visibility gaps and inconsistent policy enforcement.
- Disconnected tools prevent real-time risk evaluation, amplifying exposure to threats like phishing and AI-driven attacks.

## What Is Access Fabric?

Access Fabric is a unified, adaptive approach to access security. Rather than a single product, it is a strategy integrating identity, device, network, and application signals to continuously evaluate trust at every authentication and network touchpoint.

- **Unified signals:** Merges information from identity, device health, network activity, and business context.
- **Real-time risk evaluation:** Policies are triggered immediately when changes—such as switching from secure to public WiFi—are detected.
- **Zero Trust principles:** Access is verified continuously, not just at sign-in.

## AI and the Evolving Threat Landscape

- 79% of organizations with 6+ identity/network solutions report an increase in security breaches.
- AI empowers attackers to automate intrusion, craft more effective phishing attacks, and exploit defensive seams.
- Organizations must close security gaps to defend against increasingly sophisticated, AI-powered threats.

## Everyday Scenario: The Importance of Unified Controls

- With fragmented security, a session token issued on a secure network may remain valid on a public network, leaving sensitive resources exposed.
- An Access Fabric-enabled system detects the switch to public WiFi and responds by revoking access to confidential resources, minimizing risk even when users are mobile.
- Policies respond dynamically to network trustworthiness, device state, and user behavior.

## What Makes an Access Fabric Solution Effective?

### Contextual

- Uses a rich set of signals (identity, device posture, network telemetry, business context) for decision-making.

### Connected

- Identity and network controls share signals and enforce consistent policies across environments.

### Continuous

- Ongoing verification throughout each session; adaptive risk response if user, device, or network state changes.

## Benefits for Organizations and Security Teams

- Simplified governance through unified policy engines.
- Improved security for both human and AI/machine identities.
- More consistent, user-friendly experience with stronger protection.
- Safer experimentation with AI, as adaptive controls govern both human and machine access.
