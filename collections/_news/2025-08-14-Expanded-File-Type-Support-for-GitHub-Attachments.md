# Expanded File Type Support for GitHub Attachments

GitHub has rolled out expanded support for file attachments in issues, pull requests, and discussions. Users can now upload a much wider variety of file types directly into their collaborative threads, making it easier to share all relevant artifacts without leaving the platform.

## What's New?

- **Wider range of supported file types**, such as:
  - **Code/Data:** `.py`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.css`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.js`, `.sql`, `.java`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.sh`, `.php`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.cs`, `.ipynb`, `.pdb`, `.xlsm`, `.tsv`, `.drawio`, `.bin`
  - **Documents:** `.rtf`, `.doc`
  - **Text/Email:** `.debug`, `.msg`, `.eml`, `.copilotmd`
  - **Images:** `.bmp`, `.tif`, `.tiff`
  - **Audio:** `.mp3`, `.wav`
- Attachments can be added to issues, pull requests, discussions, and comments.
- Easily share code snippets, logs, configuration files, data, images, and other key resources between collaborators.

## How Does This Help?

- Streamlines development workflows by reducing friction in sharing relevant files.
- Improves traceability and context by keeping important artifacts within the discussion platform.
- Supports better troubleshooting and collaboration by allowing more direct information exchange.

## More Information
