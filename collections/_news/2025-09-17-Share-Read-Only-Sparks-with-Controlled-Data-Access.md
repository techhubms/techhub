Allison details the new read-only sharing feature for Sparks on GitHub, offering developers greater data control and outlining related workflow improvements.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Share Read-Only Sparks with Controlled Data Access

GitHub now lets you share your Sparks as **read-only**, offering better control over how others interact with your GitHub apps. When sharing a Spark, you can now pick between:

- **Write-access** (users can edit Spark content)
- **Read-access** (users can only view your Spark)

### How to Share a Read-Only Spark

1. Publish your Spark on GitHub
2. Set the visibility option to either **Organization** or **All GitHub users**
3. In the expanded data access options, select **Read access** to restrict editing

This feature enables safe data sharing and collaboration—either within your organization or with the wider GitHub community—without risking unintended changes to your app’s data.

## Workflow and Quality Improvements

Recent updates also include several bug fixes and quality enhancements:

- **JSON Mode Fix:** Corrected issues with JSON return format when calling `spark.llm` using JSON mode
- **Editor Sync:** Improved synchronization in the Spark code editor to prevent lag or unsaved changes
- **Loading State:** Fixed issues causing Sparks to get stuck in “loading” states, resulting in smoother workbench logic

These changes make building and managing apps with GitHub Spark more reliable and efficient.
