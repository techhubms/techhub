# The New Test Run Hub in Azure Test Plans Reaches General Availability

Delivering high-quality software demands robust tools for clarity, speed, and team collaboration. The Azure DevOps team is announcing the general availability (GA) of the new [Test Run Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/test-runs?view=azure-devops) within Azure Test Plans, rolling out to all organizations throughout January 2026.

## Key Features and Improvements

### 1. Centralized Test Execution

- Unified platform for both manual and automated test runs.
- Programmatic capabilities via the Azure DevOps REST API for automation and integration.

### 2. Enhanced Real-Time Visibility

- Instantly monitor test progress, spot regressions, and track quality trends before they impact release cycles.
- Built-in dashboards provide comprehensive analytics, breaking down results by outcome, priority, configuration, and failure type.

### 3. Intuitive Management Tools

- Flexible filters (timeline, run type, pipeline, etc.) and persistent search/column preferences streamline information retrieval.
- Improved attachment handling: Previews and easier deletion of artifacts.

### 4. Rich Collaboration

- Effortless sharing of screenshots, logs, and artifacts directly in test runs.
- Markdown-enabled comments and direct linking of results to work items.

### 5. Personalization and Usability

- Filters and view settings now persist by user profile across sessions.
- Enhanced search by Test Run ID or Title, with lookback over any 90-day period.
- Landing page improvements: Inline screenshot previews, with more details such as Run Title, Last Updated Date, and Owner displayed for rapid identification.

## Transition to the New Hub

- Automatic transition for all organizations using Azure DevOps Services will occur in January 2026.
- After GA, legacy Test Run Hub access will be retired/discontinued.

## Community Feedback

The release incorporates feedback from the Azure DevOps community, leading to refinements in navigation, data presentation, and search.

## Get Involved

Users are encouraged to share ideas or report issues through the [Azure DevOps Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/AzureDevOps) portal.

## Conclusion

The new Test Run Hub delivers a streamlined, data-rich, and collaborative environment aimed at helping teams ship faster, reduce release risk, and ensure software quality.
