# Pull Request “Files Changed” Public Preview: November 20 Updates

**Author:** Allison

Developers using GitHub can now view the pull request description directly on the new “Files changed” page, reducing the need to scroll or switch tabs. To access the description, click the **Overview** button in the toolbar.

> _This improvement is exclusive to the new 'Files changed' page, currently available as a public preview. Users of the classic experience can opt into the new version using the 'Try the new experience' prompt at the top of the classic page._

## Performance and More

Since the last update, multiple fixes have been implemented, including performance enhancements for navigating from the “Files changed” page to other areas in GitHub. More performance improvements are underway and will be released in the following weeks.

## Providing Feedback

The GitHub team invites users to share their feedback, report issues, and ask questions through the [Files Changed experience feedback discussion](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback). As the feature is in public preview, UI components are subject to change.
