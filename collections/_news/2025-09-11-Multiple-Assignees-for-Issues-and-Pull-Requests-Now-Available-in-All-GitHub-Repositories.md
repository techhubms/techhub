Allison highlights GitHub's new feature allowing up to 10 users to be assigned to issues and pull requests, improving collaboration and project visibility for all repository types.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Multiple Assignees for Issues and Pull Requests Now Available in All GitHub Repositories

GitHub has introduced the ability to assign up to 10 users to any issue or pull request, regardless of repository privacy or plan. Prior to this update, private repositories on free plans were limited to a single assignee, potentially creating communication challenges for teams.

**What’s new:**

- You can now select up to 10 assignees per issue or pull request in all public and private repos.
- This change helps teams clarify who is responsible for specific work items, improving transparency and accountability.
- The feature is now available to all users, removing previous limitations for free plan private repositories.

**Getting Started:**

- To use the new multi-assignee feature, navigate to an issue or pull request and select assignees from the drop-down menu.
- For more information, refer to [GitHub’s documentation on assigning issues and pull requests](https://docs.github.com/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users).

**Benefits:**

- Enhanced collaboration and communication
- Improved workload sharing and knowledge tracking within teams
- More efficient project management and workflow visibility

This change is part of GitHub's ongoing effort to improve tools for software development teams and open-source projects.
