# GPT-5 is now generally available in GitHub Models

OpenAI's GPT-5—their most advanced AI model to date—is now accessible to developers and organizations via GitHub Models. GPT-5 delivers significant improvements over previous versions, particularly in reasoning, code quality, and multimodal conversation capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Reasoning**: Enhanced ability to perform complex, multi-step tasks with clearer logical structure.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Better at generating, refining, and explaining code with minimum prompting.
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Designed to act as an intelligent coding collaborator and assistant.

## GPT-5 Model Variants

- **gpt-5**: Optimized for logic and multi-step operations.
- **gpt-5-mini**: Lightweight, cost-efficient model.
- **gpt-5-nano**: High-speed, low-latency version for performance-sensitive applications.
- **gpt-5-chat**: Advanced for conversational, multimodal, and context-aware tasks, ideal for enterprise use.

## How to Access

- **Models Tab**: Enable and select GPT-5 models from the [GitHub Models tab](https://docs.github.com/github-models/about-github-models#enabling-github-models).
- **Playground**: Experiment interactively on the [GitHub Models playground](https://github.com/marketplace/models).
- **API Access**: Utilize the latest models via the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/github-models/prototyping-with-ai-models#experimenting-with-ai-models-using-the-api) for custom integration.

## Developer Opportunities

- Try sample prompts from the playground
- Integrate GPT-5 into your own applications
- Use alongside other models (e.g., Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Microsoft)
- Join [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/models?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3AModels+) to share experiences and provide feedback
