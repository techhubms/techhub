# Microsoft Named a Leader in IDC MarketScape for Unified AI Governance Platforms

Microsoft has been recognized as a Leader in the 2025–2026 IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Unified AI Governance Platforms, reflecting the company’s commitment to delivering secure, responsible, and enterprise-ready AI governance solutions.

## Unified Governance for Modern AI

With the growing adoption of generative and agentic AI, unified governance is critical. Microsoft's centralized, end-to-end governance platform addresses regulatory, operational, and security risks across hybrid and multicloud environments. Key features include:

- **Responsible AI**: Microsoft’s Responsible AI standard and the Office of Responsible AI are embedded throughout their engineering and operations practices to ensure transparency, fairness, explainability, and compliance, giving organizations confidence in deploying AI systems.
- **Unified Governance Tools**: Microsoft Foundry provides a developer control plane for model lifecycle management, while Microsoft Agent 365 acts as a control and management plane for IT, enabling secure deployment and monitoring of agentic AI (including Copilot Studio and Microsoft 365 Copilot agents).
- **Integrated Security**: Deep integrations with Microsoft Purview, Entra, and Defender secure data, manage identity, and protect against AI-specific threats such as prompt-injection attacks. Audit logs and automated documentation support regulatory requirements.

## Guidance for Security and Governance Leaders

Microsoft offers actionable recommendations for CISOs and security teams:
