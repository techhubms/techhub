# 4 Priorities for AI-Powered Identity and Network Access Security in 2026

Cybersecurity is entering a new era, driven by the rapid evolution of AI on both sides of the threat landscape. As attackers leverage AI to automate phishing, impersonation, and attacks, organizations need to rethink how they manage and protect their identities and networks. This article—originally appeared on [Microsoft's Security blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/01/20/four-priorities-for-ai-powered-identity-and-network-access-security-in-2026/)—distills four key priorities to help organizations stay ahead:

## 1. Implement Fast, Adaptive, and Relentless AI-Powered Protection

- AI is becoming central in both cyberattacks and defense.
- Microsoft Entra now includes built-in AI agents (like the Conditional Access Optimization Agent) that help identity teams design, refine, and govern access policies faster and with more accuracy.
- These agents analyze sign-in patterns, policy gaps, and recommend improvements. Studies have shown major improvements in task speed and accuracy for identity admins leveraging these solutions.
- AI agents move defense from reactive to proactive, operating at the speed and scale of attackers.

## 2. Manage, Govern, and Protect AI and Agents

- Every AI agent should be treated as a first-class identity, governed as closely as human users.
- Tools like [Microsoft Entra Agent ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-agent-id) allow organizations to register, manage, and monitor agents, assign sponsors, and automate onboarding and offboarding.
- [Microsoft Entra Internet Access](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access) integrates with Defender and Purview to block unsanctioned apps, prevent prompt injection, and protect against data exfiltration.
- Policies and guardrails can be applied for least privilege, just-in-time access, and other Zero Trust principles.

## 3. Extend Zero Trust Principles Everywhere with Integrated Access Fabric Security

- Organizations often rely on multiple siloed identity and network access solutions; attackers exploit the gaps in-between.
- Microsoft Entra brings together identity and network access controls under a unified Zero Trust policy engine (Microsoft Entra Conditional Access), offering fine-grained, real-time risk assessment.
- An Access Fabric solution ensures every user session—human or agent—is continuously monitored and protected, both in the cloud and on-premises.

## 4. Strengthen Your Identity and Access Foundation

- Adopt strong, phishing-resistant credentials (like passkeys and security defaults) and validate identities with Microsoft Entra Verified ID.
- Automate the enforcement of baseline controls with security defaults, managed policies, and hardening measures.
- Ensure high-assurance onboarding and recovery, preventing impersonation attacks, including those using AI.
