## Release Highlights

- **Node.js 18 End-of-Life**: Per the [official Node.js release timeline](https://nodejs.org/about/previous-releases), Node.js 18 will reach its official end-of-life on April 30, 2025. After this date, security updates and critical bug fixes will cease. **Upgrading to a supported Node.js version is strongly recommended to maintain platform support.**

- **Support Policy:** Azure SDK libraries are not guaranteed to work on platforms or dependencies which are end-of-life. Dropping support for those may occur without a major version increment. Migrate to supported platforms and dependencies to ensure continued technical support.
