# MCP Registry and New GitHub Copilot Features in Eclipse

GitHub Copilot for Eclipse has received a major update, bringing several new features and improvements that make AI-assisted coding smoother and more customizable for developers.

## ✨ What's New

### MCP Registry

- Easily discover and install MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers from a centralized registry.
- Browse available servers, view their capabilities, and instantly add them to your workspace—all without manual configuration.

### Manage Todo List Tool

- Copilot can create and manage a structured todo list when you handle complex tasks.
- Track your progress in real-time as the agent updates and checks off todos, giving improved visibility into development workflows.

### Chat View UX Enhancements

- **Font Size Control:** Adjust chat view font size with keyboard shortcuts:
  - macOS: `⌘ + =` / `⌘ + -`
  - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + =` / `Ctrl + -`
- **Dark Theme Refresh:** Higher contrast and better readability for late-night work.
- **Undo/Redo Support:** Undo or redo messages within chat input seamlessly.
- **Native Toolbar Integration:** Chat view buttons are now integrated with the Eclipse toolbar for more natural workflow alignment.

> **Note:** If new chat buttons don't appear, delete the `workbench.xmi` file at `/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.e4.workbench/`.

### Editor Selection Context

- Copilot now includes your editor's current selection in chat context.
- Select code, open chat, and Copilot will use your selection, making conversations more targeted and relevant.

### New Preferences

- **Agent Max Requests:** Set limits for agent task requests and control when a 'continue' prompt appears for large jobs.
- **Commit Instructions:** Customize how Copilot generates commit messages to better fit your workflow and team standards.
