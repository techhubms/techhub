# Extending Azure: AI-Powered Innovation, Resiliency, and Control

Microsoft is expanding Azure's public regions by introducing flexible options tailored to the growing demands of organizations running mission-critical workloads. These enhancements aim to provide advanced AI, compute, and analytics capabilities while preserving operational autonomy, resilience, and compliance.

## Azure Local: Meeting Data Sovereignty and Operational Needs

- **Azure Local** delivers Azure infrastructure directly in customer datacenters or distributed sites.
- Integrated with **Azure Arc**, it extends cloud services to hybrid and disconnected environments, enabling control over compute, storage, and networking.
- Real-world impact: Companies like **GSK** leverage Azure Local for real-time data processing and AI inference across manufacturing and R&D locations worldwide.
- General Availability and Preview features:
  - **Microsoft 365 Local** for secure, sovereign productivity within private clouds.
  - NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 GPUs powering on-premises generative AI and analytics.
  - **Azure Migrate** support streamlining legacy migrations.
  - Rack-Aware Clustering, external SAN integration, multi-rack deployments, and disconnected operations provide fault tolerance and scale for complex estates.

## Operational AI and IoT Integration

- Azure’s adaptive cloud brings **AI to physical operations**, using the **Azure IoT platform** to connect devices and sensors securely.
- **Microsoft Fabric** integration offers real-time insights and advanced analytics.
- Use cases span manufacturing and energy, enabling predictive maintenance and worker safety.
- Recent improvements:
  - X.509 certificate management and Azure Device Registry enhancements for secure identity and fleet management.
  - WebAssembly-powered analytics, expanded protocol connectors, OpenTelemetry support for robust data ingestion.
  - **Fabric IQ** and **Digital Twin Builder** transform telemetry into actionable insights, closing the loop for intelligent feedback and simulation.

## Unified Azure Management and Security

- **Azure Arc** simplifies oversight of distributed digital estates—on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge.
- Enhancements include:
  - Azure Arc Site Manager for physical resource organization.
  - GCP connector preview for multicloud management.
  - Machine Configuration and new Azure policies ensuring compliance and operational resilience.
  - Workload Identity and AKS Fleet Manager centralize Kubernetes management and secure access via Entra ID.
  - Key Vault Secret Store Extension increases resiliency against network outages.

## Business Value and Adaptive Cloud Strategy

Azure’s ongoing improvements reflect a commitment to meet customers’ evolving requirements, enabling innovation and modernization without loss of control or compliance. This unified platform supports a full spectrum of applications, from AI and analytics to legacy IT migrations, within resilient, secure, and sovereign environments.
