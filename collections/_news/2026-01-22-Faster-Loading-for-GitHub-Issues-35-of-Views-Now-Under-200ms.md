# Faster Loading for GitHub Issues: 35% of Views Now Under 200ms

GitHub Issues has received a substantial performance boost, according to Allison's recent announcement. The platform now delivers 35% of issue page views in less than 200 milliseconds, compared to only 2% earlier this year.

## Key Highlights

- **Instant Experience:** The improvement is part of GitHub’s broader initiative to make navigation and collaboration feel instant.

## Availability

- Live now on [github.com](https://github.com/).
- Users must be signed in to experience the improvements.
- No additional configuration or opt-in is needed.
- Enhancements benefit:
  - The repository index (e.g., [cli/cli issues](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues))
  - The Issues dashboard ([assigned issues](https://github.com/issues/assigned))
  - GitHub Project boards ([example project](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247))
- Further improvements are planned for additional sections of GitHub.
