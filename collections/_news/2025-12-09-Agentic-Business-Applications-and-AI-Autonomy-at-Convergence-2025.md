# Agentic Business Applications and AI Autonomy at Convergence 2025

Convergence 2025 signals a transformative shift in business operations, emphasizing the integration of generative AI and agentic business applications. Microsoft demonstrates how organizations can move from systems of record to systems of action, leveraging AI agents to interpret business signals, uncover patterns, and autonomously optimize processes.

## Key Themes

- **AI Agents** are increasingly embedded throughout ERP, CRM, and operational workflows, powered by Dynamics 365, Copilot Studio, and Microsoft Cloud.
- **Agentic business applications** are built on core pillars: robust structured data, Copilot integrations, and modular, adaptive AI agents.
- **Microsoft Fabric** integrates with Dynamics 365 to provide unified, governed, and auditable business data supporting agent-powered automation.
- **The MCP Protocol** enables dynamic, scalable interactions, allowing agents to process millions of ERP actions, integrate analytics, and enhance workflow autonomy.
- **Partner Solutions** extend functionality, with agents such as Shop Floor by RSM, PayFlow Agent by HSO, and Quality Impact Recall Agent by Cegeka connecting operational domains and collaborating through Dynamics 365.

## Operational Autonomy and AI

Organizations leverage AI agents across finance, supply chain, HR, and service workflows. Embedded agents in Business Central handle everyday operations such as sales order processing, payables automation, and vendor management, reducing manual entry and streamlining reconciliations.

Agents built by partners further extend capabilities—Shop Floor enables real-time manufacturing insights, PayFlow handles payment inquiries, and Quality Impact Recall streamlines product issue resolution. These agents coordinate and act across data-rich environments, powered by Dynamics 365 and the MCP protocol.

## Copilot Studio and Developer Opportunities

Microsoft positions Copilot Studio as a platform for creating custom agents, integrating business processes, and orchestrating workflow automation. Partner and organization-built agents demonstrate extensibility and security through shared foundations in identity and governance.

## Event Announcements

- **Convergence 2025**: Technical sessions focus on transitioning to AI-first, autonomous enterprises, presenting advances in agent technology, scalable protocol integrations, and best practices for leveraging Microsoft’s unified data, AI, and application stack.
