# 7 Key Lessons from Anders Hejlsberg: Architect of C# and TypeScript

By Aaron Winston

Anders Hejlsberg, creator of Turbo Pascal, Delphi, C#, and designer of TypeScript, offers invaluable insights on what it takes to build programming languages and tools that stand the test of time. Here are seven important lessons drawn from his extensive experience:

## 1. Fast Feedback is Crucial

- Tools that enable rapid edit-compile-run cycles empower experimentation and confidence
- TypeScript’s value stems not just from language features, but from responsive tooling: incremental checking, partial results, and fast feedback—even in large projects
- Developers are more likely to experiment and catch errors early when tooling is fast

## 2. Scaling Requires Letting Go of Personal Preferences

- Successful teams must move from individual preferences to shared outcomes
- Language and tool success comes from enabling many people to collaborate, maintain, and evolve code, not from theoretical technical purity
- C# exemplifies this balance by accommodating diverse developer backgrounds and pragmatic needs

## 3. Extending, Not Replacing, the Ecosystem

- TypeScript succeeded by working with existing JavaScript workflows, not trying to replace them
- Respecting developers’ existing investments in tools and mental models encourages adoption
- Practical compromises often produce more meaningful progress than sweeping replacement

## 4. Visibility Powers Open Source

- Openness isn’t just about making code public—it’s about transparent decision-making and visible tradeoffs
- Moving development to GitHub and working in the open enabled real community feedback and improved prioritization for TypeScript

## 5. Evolution of Implementation Languages

- Self-hosting TypeScript in JavaScript enabled broad experimentation, but also had limitations due to JavaScript’s concurrency model
- Switching the compiler core to Go unlocked significant performance improvements while maintaining compatibility
- Pragmatic choices sometimes involve technological shifts to overcome scale bottlenecks

## 6. AI Changes, But Doesn’t Replace, the Developer’s Role

- AI tools excel at code generation in mainstream (well-known) languages
- Reliable tools—type systems, refactoring engines, semantic models—will become more critical in supervising and constraining AI-generated code
- The key is precision and guardrails, not just creativity

## 7. Open Collaboration & Institutional Memory

- Decisions, tradeoffs, and debates preserved in open development spaces (like GitHub) provide lasting context
- Shared historical record strengthens long-term maintainability and supports new contributors

## Key Patterns Across Decades

- Fast feedback, behavioral compatibility, and visible tradeoffs are more essential than theoretical elegance
- Adapting to real-world constraints, embracing shared outcomes, and keeping decision-making open are what enable tools to endure
