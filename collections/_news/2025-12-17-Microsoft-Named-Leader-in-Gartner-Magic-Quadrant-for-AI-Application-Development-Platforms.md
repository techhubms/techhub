# Microsoft Named Leader in Gartner Magic Quadrant for AI Application Development Platforms

Microsoft has been recognized as a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for AI Application Development Platforms, positioned furthest for Completeness of Vision. This recognition underscores Microsoft's commitment to pioneering new approaches in agent frameworks, orchestration, and enterprise-grade governance, positioning the company at the forefront of next-generation AI application development.

## Why This Matters

Gartner evaluates platforms on Completeness of Vision and Ability to Execute. Microsoft's leadership signifies that its vision for agent-driven applications is matched by robust, real-world tools and governance. Modern AI applications require more than just innovative demos—they need agent frameworks grounded in enterprise data, capable of automating complex workflows with full-scale observability and security.

## Microsoft Foundry: Technical Innovation for AI

[Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/?msockid=1ecb0104704a6d1e271f17bb718a6cc9) is at the heart of this innovation. Foundry enables developers and organizations to:

- **Integrate with real data and tools**: Foundry IQ provides secure access to enterprise data, and Foundry Tools offers 1,400+ pre-built connectors for various business systems.
- **Move beyond conversation to workflow integration**: Foundry Agent Service supports orchestration among multiple agents, enabling automated business process execution within Copilot or custom applications.
- **Ensure observability and governance**: Foundry Control Plane delivers organization-wide visibility, audit trails, and policy enforcement, supporting compliance at scale.
- **Deploy models from cloud to edge**: Foundry Models supports fine-tuning and deployment with enterprise-grade operations, including on-device execution via Foundry Local for edge or offline scenarios.

Foundry integrates with industry-standard developer tools (Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Azure) and productivity platforms (Microsoft 365, Teams), enabling seamless development and deployment of AI applications.

## Agent-driven Development Approach

For their Gartner submission, Microsoft built a custom agent using their open-source Agent Framework and Foundry platform. The agent automated data gathering, organization, and validation for the evaluation process, improving accuracy and reducing manual effort. Technical highlights include a structured prompt and workflow, integration with Foundry's PaaS offerings, and multimodal content processing. This approach exemplifies Microsoft's focus on technical rigor and innovation.

## Real-world Impact: Customer Success Stories

Microsoft Foundry is already used by over 80,000 enterprises across multiple sectors, from healthcare to manufacturing. Customer quotes highlight achievements like:

- **Conversational AI for healthcare** (Genie / healow)
- **Generative AI for industrial performance** (Genix Copilot on Azure OpenAI / ABB)
- **Agent framework for regulated audit processes** (Foundry Agent Service / KPMG International)
- **AI-based shopping experiences** (Ask Ralph / Ralph Lauren)

These stories demonstrate how Foundry empowers organizations to build scalable, trustworthy, and innovative AI systems.
