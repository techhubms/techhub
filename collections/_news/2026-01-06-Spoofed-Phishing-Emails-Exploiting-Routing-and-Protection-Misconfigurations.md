Microsoft Threat Intelligence investigates an uptick in phishing campaigns abusing complex mail routing and misconfigured spoof protections, detailing detection, real-world attack methods, and robust mitigation guidance.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Spoofed Phishing Emails Exploiting Routing and Protection Misconfigurations

Microsoft Threat Intelligence has observed increasingly sophisticated phishing campaigns that exploit complex mail routing scenarios and misconfigured spoof protections to deliver spoofed emails. These malicious messages are crafted to appear as if they've been sent internally within organizations, making them more convincing to recipients and increasing the success rate of credential theft and financial fraud.

## Attack Vector Overview

Threat actors are leveraging phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platforms such as Tycoon2FA to distribute a range of lures—voicemail notifications, shared documents, HR messages, and more. The distinguishing feature of these campaigns is their exploitation of routing complexities or improper enforcement of authentication and spoofing protections (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) in environments where mail exchange (MX) records are not directed at Office 365.

> **Key note:** Tenants with MX records pointed directly to Office 365 enjoy stronger, native spoofing detection and are not vulnerable to this attack vector.

## Technical Analysis and Attack Examples

Phishing emails often:

- Use the same recipient address in the “To” and “From” fields, mimicking internal communications
- Employ display name spoofs and themes such as password expirations, HR notices, or fake invoice requests
- Utilize credential capture pages, QR codes, and malicious links via redirectors
- Bypass detection in environments lacking strictly enforced SPF, DKIM, and DMARC policies

### Example: Spoofed Office 365 Notification

A phishing message masquerades as a password expiration notice from Microsoft Office 365, complete with a tailored subject line and links hidden behind nested URLs (e.g., Google Maps or specific domains like *amphen0l-fci[.]com*). Authentication headers reveal SPF and DMARC failures, but action is not always enforced due to routing misconfigurations.

### Example: Financial Scam Thread

Another documented case involves a fake invoice email thread spoofed to appear from the CEO or accounting department, with authentic-looking attachments including invoices, W-9 forms, and bank letters—potentially enabling significant financial theft.

## Detection and Investigation

Microsoft details detection logic for:

- **Microsoft Defender XDR**: Use queries provided to search for inbound spoofed emails based on header analysis, domain indicators, and authentication failures.
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Deploy hunting queries matching IP, domain, and spoof activity using Sentinel Advanced Security Information Model (ASIM).

### Query Examples (Defender XDR)

```kusto
EmailEvents | where EmailDirection == "Inbound" | where SenderFromDomain in ("contoso.com", "fabrikam.com") | where AuthenticationDetails !contains "SPF=pass" | where AuthenticationDetails !contains "DKIM=pass" | where AuthenticationDetails !contains "DMARC=pass"
```

### Notable Indicators of Compromise

- IPs: 162.19.196[.]13, 51.89.59[.]188, among others
- Domains: 2fa.valoufroo.in[.]net, integralsm[.]cl, absoluteprintgroup[.]com

## Mitigation Guidance

Organizations should:

- Strictly enforce SPF (hard fail), DKIM, and DMARC (reject/quarantine)
- Correctly configure all third-party connectors and mail flow rules if using on-premises or hybrid environments
- Implement Microsoft Defender for Office 365 features such as Safe Links and Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP)
- Roll out phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) and enforce conditional access policies
- Train users to scrutinize internal email sender fields and remain vigilant for urgent requests involving credentials or payments

### Remediation Steps After Detection

1. Reset credentials and revoke sessions for compromised accounts
2. Review and remove unauthorized inbox rules or MFA device changes
3. Revert fraudulent financial changes and alert relevant teams
4. Confirm secure, phishing-resistant MFA re-registration
