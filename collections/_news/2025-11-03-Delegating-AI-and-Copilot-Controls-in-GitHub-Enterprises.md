# Delegating AI and Copilot Controls in GitHub Enterprises

GitHub Enterprise now allows enterprise owners to delegate AI and Copilot feature management to enterprise members and teams without requiring broad ownership rights. These updates introduce fine-grained permissions (FGPs) to control access to AI and Copilot administration, making it easier for organizations to scale management of AI technologies securely.

## Key Features

- **Fine-Grained Permissions (FGPs)**: Grant read or write access to the agent control plane, enabling more targeted assignment of responsibilities.
- **Custom Enterprise Roles**: Owners can create custom roles with specific permissions for managing AI and Copilot settings.
- **AI Controls Tab**: New roles can view or manage all AI configuration within the dedicated enterprise AI Controls area.
- **Granular Access**: Additional FGPs can be added, such as access to enterprise audit logs, allowing for detailed monitoring and compliance without over-privileging users.
- **Agent Control Plane**: Announced in the Universe 2025 event, these features provide enterprises deeper control and greater audit capabilities over Copilot and custom agent use.

## Example Permissions

- **View enterprise AI controls**: Read-only access to AI settings for oversight.
- **Manage enterprise AI controls**: Full management ability over enterprise AI configurations.
- **Read enterprise audit logs**: (Must be explicitly added) Provides access to audit log review for monitoring agentic activities.

These updates help enterprises scale AI oversight, ensure compliance, and delegate operational tasks while maintaining secure boundaries.
