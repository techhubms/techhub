Allison introduces the updated GitHub pull request “Files Changed” experience, covering major improvements for code review, accessibility, and performance.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub's Improved Pull Request “Files Changed” Experience Now Default

**Author:** Allison

The improved pull request “Files Changed” experience, previously in public preview, is now rolling out by default to all GitHub users. This major update aims to make code review more efficient and accessible for developers of all backgrounds.

## What's New

- **Comment on Any Line:** Users can now comment on any line of a changed file, not just those directly affected by changes ([learn more](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-09-25-pull-request-files-changed-public-preview-now-supports-commenting-on-unchanged-lines/)).
- **View Description Without Switching Pages:** Access the pull request description directly from the new [Overview panel](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-11-20-pull-request-files-changed-public-preview-november-20-updates/) without changing pages.
- **Enhanced Review Workflows:** Reviewing pull requests is more intuitive, with improvements for draft comments, pending comment review, and a refreshed, resizable file tree. Visual indicators now show where comments and issues exist.
- **Better Accessibility and Productivity:** Keyboard navigation, enhanced screen reader support, and increased line spacing options improve accessibility. Fewer page reloads streamline navigation and productivity.

## Improvements for Large Pull Requests

A new experimental mode uses virtualization to efficiently load and display large pull requests, improving memory use and page responsiveness. While in this mode, some functions such as searching for diff content, selecting all text, or using certain browser extensions may be limited. Users can easily switch back to single file mode as needed.

## Fixes and Additional Enhancements

- More reliable and intuitive commenting workflows
- Multi-line selection and improved focus for new comments
- Fixes for bugged or partially applied suggested code changes
- Resolved issues with comment threads, side panels, and navigation
- Improved keyboard shortcuts for changing commits
- Better UI consistency, scroll handling, and mobile experience
- Multiple accessibility and interaction improvements, especially for screen readers

## Feedback

GitHub encourages users to [provide feedback](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback) on these changes to continue improving the code review process.
