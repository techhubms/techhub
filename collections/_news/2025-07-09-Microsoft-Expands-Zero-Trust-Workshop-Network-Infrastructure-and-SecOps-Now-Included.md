In this article, Rob Lefferts explains Microsoft’s expanded Zero Trust workshop, now featuring guidance on network, infrastructure, and SecOps pillars to help organizations enhance their security posture and operational workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Overview

Rob Lefferts, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft Threat Protection, details the expansion of Microsoft's Zero Trust workshop—an initiative designed to help organizations modernize their security strategies. The workshop previously covered identity, devices, and data; it now includes three additional pillars: networking, infrastructure, and security operations (SecOps).

## Key Expansions

### 1. Additional Technical Pillars

- **Networking**: Focus on micro-segmentation, real-time threat detection, and secure access to network resources.
- **Infrastructure**: Securing both cloud and on-premises environments, emphasizing robust configurations, access management, and continuous monitoring.
- **SecOps**: Enhancing threat detection and response with tools like Microsoft Defender suite and Microsoft Sentinel.

### 2. Practical Guidance

- Each step in the workshop comes with implementation effort and user impact indicators, allowing organizations to better plan and prioritize security improvements.
- Cross-pillar scenarios and role assignments are highlighted to bridge gaps between teams and ensure holistic adoption.

## Workshop Features

- **Framework and Benchmarks**: The workshop provides not only prescriptive steps but also frameworks for measuring progress and benchmarking security posture over time.
- **Customer and Partner Adoption**: Over 3,000 downloads and usage by more than 150 Microsoft Partners highlight broad acceptance and practical utility.

## Microsoft Security Integration

- Direct linkage with Microsoft security products such as Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Identity, and Sentinel enables organizations to operationalize Zero Trust strategies using familiar tools.

## Commitment to Partners and Customers

- Microsoft encourages partners and customers alike to leverage the workshop, alongside the Zero Trust Partner Kit and Guidance Center, to advance their security strategies and practices.

## Feedback and Continuous Improvement

- The expanded workshop is shaped by ongoing customer feedback and real-world deployment scenarios, and Microsoft solicits additional input to refine and adapt the material.

## Call to Action

- Organizations looking to modernize their security approach are invited to download and implement the expanded Zero Trust workshop, integrating it with existing Microsoft security solutions for maximum efficacy.
