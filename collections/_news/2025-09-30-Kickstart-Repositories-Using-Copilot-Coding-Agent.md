Allison introduces the Copilot coding agent for GitHub repositories, empowering developers to start projects faster by generating code and creating draft pull requests using AI-powered prompts.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Kickstart Repositories Using Copilot Coding Agent

GitHub now offers an enhanced workflow for starting new repositories through the Copilot coding agent. When creating a new repository:

- On the "New repository" page, enter your desired prompt in the **Prompt** field.
- After the repository is created, Copilot will automatically open a draft pull request with code matching your prompt.
- You’ll receive a request to review the newly created code, streamlining project setup.

## Availability

- **Copilot coding agent** is accessible to subscribers of Copilot Pro, Copilot Pro+, Copilot Business, and Copilot Enterprise.
- For Business and Enterprise users, an administrator must enable the coding agent from the [Policies page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/coding-agent-for-business-and-enterprise).

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Enter a prompt describing your desired starter code or project setup.
3. Review the draft pull request created by Copilot and suggest improvements or approve as needed.

## Learn More

- Read official documentation: [Copilot coding agent overview](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent).
