# Transforming Event Management with InEvent and Microsoft Azure

Event management is evolving quickly, with increasing demands for integrated systems, real-time updates, and automation. InEvent, in collaboration with Microsoft for Startups, is shaping an event platform where Microsoft solutions work together seamlessly to address the complexity of modern events.

## Closing the Gap: Building a Connected Ecosystem

- **Disconnected tools** often force teams to manually sync systems, from CRMs to calendar invites and streaming links.
- InEvent and Microsoft are working to automate and integrate these tools, bringing together Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, Outlook, and AI assistants like ChatGPT for a unified event management experience.

## The Solution: Deep Technical Integration

- **Azure as a Foundation**: InEvent runs entirely on Microsoft Azure, using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalable, resilient infrastructure.
- **Marketplace Availability**: InEvent is available via Azure Marketplace, making deployment and governance easier for enterprise clients.

### Enterprise Security and Identity

- Uses **Azure Active Directory** for single sign-on (SSO), so users can access the system with their existing credentials.
- Simplifies IT provisioning and security reviews, reducing friction for organizers and attendees.

### Automated Workflow and Calendar Sync

- **Native Outlook Calendar Integration**: All RSVPs, session updates, and invitations are managed in real time.
- Changes made in InEvent reflect automatically across attendee calendars, schedules, and notifications.

### CRM Integration and Data Flow

- **Dynamics 365 Integration**: Attendee behaviors, registrations, and interactions are automatically pushed to sales/marketing pipelines.
- Enables more targeted outreach and clearer ROI tracking for event stakeholders.

### AI and Automation with Azure OpenAI Service

- InEvent incorporates **Azure OpenAI Service**, deploying ChatGPT-powered features for tasks like:
  - Drafting speaker bios
  - Generating reminder emails
  - Content suggestions
  - Real-time audience segmentation
- Reduces manual admin work for planners, freeing up time for high-value activities.

## Power of Partnership

- **Mentorship and Go-to-Market Support**: Microsoft for Startups has provided not just cloud credits, but also guidance and technical support for InEvent’s AI innovation.
- **User Familiarity and Adoption**: By embedding InEvent within Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and Dynamics 365, enterprises can adopt new, smarter workflows with less friction.

## Looking Forward

- As AI workflows become more central, the line between collaboration platforms and event-specific tools will blur further.
- Real-time insights from Dynamics 365 will empower better strategic decisions for event ROI and business impact.
- The partnership is focused on giving organizers more time for creative and impactful work—not replacing people, but empowering them with technology.
