# India’s Shriram Finance Partners with Microsoft to Modernize Digital Financial Services

Shriram Finance, a leading Indian financial services provider, has partnered with Microsoft to deliver a cloud-native banking platform—Shriram One—that brings together lending, payments, insurance, and deposit management under a single digital interface. This transformation supports over 20 million users, many in semi-urban and rural India, making financial services more accessible and seamless.

## Real-World Impact

- **Customer Stories:**
  - *Ashwini Kuchekar* used the Shriram One app to apply for a business loan, expanding her grocery store and creating jobs without ever visiting a branch.
  - *Shivjot Singh*, a truck driver, secured and managed a commercial vehicle loan entirely on the app, integrating digital payments and insurance with his daily workflow.

## Cloud-Native Platform on Microsoft Azure

Shriram One is architected from the ground up as a cloud-native platform using Microsoft Azure, providing:

- **Scalable, resilient infrastructure** for rapid customer onboarding and service rollouts
- **Integrated analytics and automation** supporting personalization
- **Real-time monitoring** for risk and operations
- **Multi-language support** to ensure accessibility across India’s diverse population

## Security and Compliance

Security is central, with:

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** and **Microsoft Sentinel** providing built-in security, monitoring, and compliance features
- **Data hosting in India** for regulatory adherence and customer trust
- Features like enhanced authentication alerts and data dashboards serving risk-averse customers

## Embedded AI and Machine Learning

AI and machine learning are used responsibly to:

- *Personalize recommendations* based on customer engagement
- *Improve onboarding* by pre-filling data
- *Train chatbots* for handling queries and routine tasks while escalating complex issues to human agents

## Organization and Technology Partnership

- *Gayadhar Behera*, CTO, and *Vinod Kumar*, Chief Digital Officer, emphasize Azure’s fit for rapid scaling and internal capability building
- *Panakala Raju* of Novac Technologies, Shriram’s technology partner, leads technical implementation, training AI models for practical use

## Key Outcomes

- Surge in digital adoption: Over 20 million app downloads, majority from Tier-2/3 cities
- Fixed deposit volumes tripled in two years
- Personalized AI models contributed to a 30% increase in deposit balances
- App features widely accessible in seven Indian languages

## Lessons Learned

- Building trust in digital finance relies on robust security, transparency, and a user-centric approach
- Microsoft Azure’s security and automation capabilities are key to scaling with confidence in a regulated environment
- Responsible AI integration and multi-language support drive deeper customer engagement
