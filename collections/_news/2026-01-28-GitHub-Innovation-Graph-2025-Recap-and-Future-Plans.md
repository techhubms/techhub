# GitHub Innovation Graph: 2025 Recap and Future Plans

Authored by Kevin Xu, this detailed article examines the evolution, impact, and next steps for the GitHub Innovation Graph—a resource providing regularly updated, aggregated statistics on public software development activities worldwide.

## Key Milestones and Updates

- **Two years of continuous data releases** since launch, with improved visualizations and bar chart race videos for metrics like git pushes, repositories, developers, and organizations.
- Innovation Graph data is increasingly central to policy-making, funding decisions, and building secure, resilient AI systems.

## Research and Academic Impact

- The dataset has fueled academic studies across topics such as:
  - Economic and social implications of global open source efforts
  - Network analysis of collaboration patterns
  - Links between software complexity, economic outcomes, and institutional history
  - The predictive role of open source in GDP, income inequality, and emissions
- Featured recent papers:
  - **Historical Institutions and Modern Digital Capabilities**: Investigates the correlation between historical mission stations and modern digital production in Africa.
  - **Cross-National Collaboration in OSS Development**: Analyzes how colonial histories influence open-source collaboration patterns using the Innovation Graph economy collaborators dataset.
  - **Small-World Phenomenon of OSS Collaboration**: Explores the tightly connected global structure of OSS communities.
  - **Software Complexity of Nations**: Demonstrates how programming language distribution and software complexity affect economic outcomes.

## Conferences and Community Engagement

- Innovation Graph presented at major events, including:
  - ATLC25 (Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy)
  - OpenForum Academy Symposium 2025
  - CEU Vienna Data Analytics Jamboree
  - Wharton Business & Generative AI Conference

## Media Coverage and Reports

- The Innovation Graph data drove features in *The Economist* (on China and India’s tech strategies) and contributed to flagship reports like the Stanford AI Index and the WIPO Global Innovation Index.

## Future Directions

- Continued releases and enhanced collaboration with researchers, policymakers, and developers
- Expansion of community-driven analytics and applications, with a stronger focus on inclusivity and open access
