Andrea Griffiths presents how GitHub’s Annotation Toolkit enables seamless design-to-code collaboration in Figma, helping developers and designers address accessibility and documentation challenges.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Enhance Design-to-Code Collaboration with GitHub's Annotation Toolkit

GitHub’s open source Annotation Toolkit is a Figma library that empowers teams to bridge gaps between design and code, emphasizing accessibility and clarity in the workflow.

## Why Design Handoff Breaks Down

Handing off design files to developers often causes confusion about interactive elements, responsive behaviors, and accessibility requirements. This miscommunication results in bugs and missed compliance issues, which are usually discovered late in the development cycle.

## GitHub’s Solution: Annotation Toolkit

Faced with this challenge, GitHub’s accessibility design team discovered that nearly 48% of their accessibility audit issues could have been prevented if design intent was better documented upfront. To tackle this, they built the Annotation Toolkit—a Figma library that provides:

- Stamps (annotations) to mark design intent beyond visuals
- Documentation of accessibility behaviors aligned with WCAG
- Numbered stamps linked to descriptive block explanations

Annotations live within the design file and remain accessible throughout the workflow, reducing reliance on scattered Figma comments or Slack messages.

## Accessibility by Default

The toolkit integrates accessibility as a design-stage concern, not a post-production fix. Each annotation includes:

- Context prompts for proper alt text, table markup, and reflow behaviors
- Guidance for linking annotations to explicit descriptive documentation

Developers gain clarity, reducing guesswork and making accessibility a shared responsibility.

## Real-World Benefits

Key advantages of the toolkit in production:

- Clarity for engineers regarding design intent
- Consistency across designers, product managers, and developers
- Preventative QA allows many issues to be resolved before code is written

Quoting a product manager at GitHub: “Annotations enable Figma to become more than just a canvas. It’s a tool for expressing a much deeper level of information.”

## Step-by-Step: Using the Annotation Toolkit

### Option 1: Via Figma Community

1. Go to the @github profile on Figma (figma.com/@github)
2. Duplicate the Annotation Toolkit file
3. Access components in your Assets tab for any project

### Option 2: From the GitHub Repository

1. Visit github.com/github/annotation-toolkit
2. Download the Figma file
3. Import and duplicate in your workspace

Once set up, drag annotation stamps into designs, pair numbers with descriptions, and use included checklists to enforce accessibility.

Full documentation and tutorials are available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/github/annotation-toolkit/tree/main/tutorials), covering annotation types, WCAG guidance, and best practices for minimizing handoff friction.

## Contribute and Collaborate

The toolkit is open source and actively maintained by GitHub staff. Users are encouraged to report issues, suggest features, and contribute new annotation types to improve accessibility standards and design handoffs.

- Explore the toolkit on [Figma @GitHub](https://www.figma.com/@github)
- Browse or contribute via [GitHub](https://github.com/github/annotation-toolkit)
- Watch the [walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/TjBO0bUK4bM)

## Conclusion

The Annotation Toolkit shifts design-to-code collaboration practices by embedding accessibility and intent within Figma, giving hybrid teams clarity and consistency from concept to production.
