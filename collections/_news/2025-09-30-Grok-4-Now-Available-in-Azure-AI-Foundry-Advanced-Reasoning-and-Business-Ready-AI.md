# Grok 4 Now Available in Azure AI Foundry: Advanced Reasoning and Business-Ready AI

Microsoft, in collaboration with xAI, has introduced Grok 4—their most advanced AI model—to Azure AI Foundry. This enables organizations to leverage powerful, business-ready AI with strong focus on safety, reasoning, and enterprise requirements.

## Key Features of Grok 4

- **First-Principles Reasoning**: Grok 4 is built for step-by-step logical problem solving, making it ideal for research, tutoring, and troubleshooting workflows where logical consistency is critical.
- **128K-token Context Window**: Capable of ingesting and reasoning over large documents, codebases, or research papers without losing track of details, making it suitable for document analysis, academic research, and large-scale code reviews.
- **Data-Aware and Real-Time Insights**: Integrates external data sources and trending information, so responses can reflect current data and dynamic research, useful for up-to-date analyses and reporting.
- **Architecture**: Grok 4 uses reinforcement learning (RL), multi-agent approaches, and a focus on reasoning over rote memorization. Trained on xAI’s Colossus supercomputer, it marks a substantial shift in model capability and scale from Grok 3.

## Safety and Enterprise Readiness

- **Enterprise Controls**: Azure AI Foundry emphasizes business-grade safety. Azure AI Content Safety is enabled by default for responsible deployment, with Grok 4 undergoing comprehensive safety tests and compliance checks.
- **Responsible Deployment**: The article emphasizes pairing Azure’s guardrails with custom domain checks, ongoing output monitoring, and transparent safety score disclosures.

## Model Variants in Azure AI Foundry

1. **Grok 4**: Full-featured for advanced reasoning and intelligence tasks.
2. **Grok 4 Fast Reasoning**: Optimized for high-speed logical inference and analytics.
3. **Grok 4 Fast Non-Reasoning**: Focused on efficiency for summarization and classification tasks.
4. **Grok Code Fast 1**: Built for code generation, debugging, and developer workflows across multiple languages.

## Pricing Overview

- Grok 4 Global Standard: Input – $5.5/1M tokens, Output – $27.5/1M tokens (includes Content Safety)

## Developer Use Cases

- **Complex research and analysis** – stepwise logical answers for scientific, business, or academic problems
- **Large-scale document or code analysis** – ingest and summarize or interrogate entire books, research articles, or code repositories
- **Real-time data synthesis** – drawing on up-to-date external information within model responses
- **Enterprise deployment** – safe, controllable AI integrations suitable for business workflows

## Getting Started

- Browse to [ai.azure.com](https://ai.azure.com/), search for “Grok,” and access model documentation and safety details via the [Grok 4 model card](https://aka.ms/grok_4).
