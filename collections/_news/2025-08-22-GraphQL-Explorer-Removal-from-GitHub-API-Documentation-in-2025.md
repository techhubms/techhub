# GraphQL Explorer Removal from GitHub API Documentation in 2025

GitHub will retire the [GraphQL Explorer](https://docs.github.com/graphql/overview/explorer) on **November 1, 2025**. This change removes the interactive iframe from the API documentation that previously allowed users to preview and experiment with the GitHub GraphQL API.

## Who Is Affected

- Developers who currently rely on the GraphQL Explorer for direct API experimentation and schema inspection.

## Rationale for Change

- The GraphQL Explorer provided only basic features and was not intended to serve as a primary development tool for the GitHub GraphQL API.
- GitHub encourages developers to adopt more robust, locally-run GraphQL clients and tools suited to their specific workflows.

## Transition Guidance

- If you use the GraphQL Explorer, transition to a local development tool of your choice for interacting with the GitHub GraphQL API.
- GitHub’s documentation will offer guides for setting up popular GraphQL clients and performing schema introspection.

## Further Resources

- Official API documentation: [GitHub GraphQL API docs](https://docs.github.com/graphql)
- Community discussion: [GitHub Community Announcements](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements)

This change is part of GitHub’s ongoing commitment to improving its APIs’ speed, scalability, and usability.
