## OpenAI’s gpt-oss Models Now on Azure AI Foundry and Windows via Foundry Local

**Author:** Satya Nadella (as posted on LinkedIn, summarized by stclarke)

### Overview

Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft, recently announced the addition of OpenAI’s open-source gpt-oss models to Microsoft Azure AI Foundry and Windows through Foundry Local. This move is positioned as a means to enable a hybrid AI infrastructure, allowing customers to "mix and match models, optimize for performance and cost, and meet your data where it lives."

### Key Announcement Highlights

- **Integration of OpenAI gpt-oss with Azure AI Foundry**: The gpt-oss models, which are open-source large language models from OpenAI, are now natively available for use within Azure AI Foundry. Organizations can deploy and operate these models within Microsoft’s secure cloud environment.
- **Availability on Windows via Foundry Local**: Leveraging Foundry Local, organizations can also run these generative AI models on Windows, supporting scenarios where computation and inference must happen on-premises or in hybrid configurations.
- **Hybrid AI Architecture**: This integration supports hybrid AI deployments, giving enterprises flexibility to combine different models according to requirements and manage their operational costs and data locality efficiently.
- **Practical Benefits**:
    - **Model Choice and Flexibility**: Users may select from a set of open-source and proprietary models, tailoring AI workloads to specific performance and cost needs.
    - **Data Sovereignty and Security**: Enables data to remain on-premises where required, addressing regulatory and compliance considerations.
    - **Cost Optimization**: Organizations can optimize their AI workflows for cost by selecting the right compute and model hosting options.

### Community and Industry Reception

Multiple professionals responded positively to Nadella’s post, noting:

- The importance of open source in the AI era and the rapid pace of innovation.
- Enthusiasm for hybrid and open AI models, especially in the context of India’s growing AI user base.
- Gratitude from AI specialists and data engineers for Microsoft’s commitment to open-source and hybrid AI innovation.
- Interest from startups and enterprise business users regarding adoption in various verticals, including fashion and supply chain optimization.
