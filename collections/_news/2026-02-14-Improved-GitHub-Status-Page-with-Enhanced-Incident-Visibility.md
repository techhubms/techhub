Allison details updates to the GitHub status page, highlighting enhanced incident tracking and service insights, with specific improvements for GitHub Actions and GitHub Copilot users.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Updated GitHub Status Page Experience

The GitHub status page has been enhanced to help developers and teams better monitor platform reliability and incident impact:

- **90-Day Historical Availability View:** Users can now access a 90-day timeline of GitHub service availability, providing clearer long-term visibility.
- **Improved Incident Links:** The interface more effectively connects service availability trends with recorded incidents on specific days, enabling quicker investigation and historical analysis.
- **Expanded Regional Coverage:** The update has been rolled out across all regions in which GitHub operates, benefiting a global user base.

## Forward-Looking Features

GitHub is working on providing more granular incident impact details, including:

- **GitHub Actions:** Clear identification of which runner environments are affected (GitHub-hosted versus self-hosted), helping teams assess CI/CD impact.
- **GitHub Copilot:** Detailed breakdowns of which Copilot features (completions, chat, agent) and specific AI models are involved in an incident, supporting developers who rely on AI assistance.

These upgrades aim to make incident information more actionable and accessible, allowing technical teams to respond more efficiently during outages or disruptions.
