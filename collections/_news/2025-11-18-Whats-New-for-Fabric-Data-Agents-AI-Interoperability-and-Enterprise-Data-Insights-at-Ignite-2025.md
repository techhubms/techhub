# What’s New for Fabric Data Agents at Ignite 2025: Unlocking Deeper Data Reasoning and Seamless AI Interoperability

## Introduction

Microsoft Fabric data agents have received significant updates, enhancing their ability to provide modular, production-ready agentic solutions on enterprise data. These agents operate as interoperable AI modules, serving as domain experts and enabling reasoning across structured and unstructured data sources within Fabric.

## Expanded Reasoning and Data Source Integration

New capabilities allow Fabric data agents to reason over increasingly broad data types:

- **Support for Unstructured Data:** Agents now analyze documents, PDFs, and other unstructured formats, extending insight beyond tables.
- **Mirrored Database and SQL Integration:** Full reasoning support over mirrored and SQL databases in Fabric.
- **Ontology Integration:** Agents leverage [Fabric Ontology](https://aka.ms/Yitzhak-Ignite25-blog) for richer semantic context, including business rules and organizational knowledge, enabling smarter, context-aware operations.
- **Azure AI Search Index:** Purpose-built search indexes from [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) empower agents to bridge structured and unstructured data for comprehensive insights.

## Interoperability with the AI Ecosystem

Fabric data agents connect seamlessly across the tech landscape:

- **Integration with Microsoft Copilot Studio and Foundry:** Build custom Copilots and orchestrate multi-agent workflows.
- **Hosted MCP Server Endpoints:** Securely connect agents to remote AI systems (including VS Code) for real-time, auditable enterprise analytics.

## Microsoft 365 Copilot Integration

Agents now fully integrate with Microsoft 365 Copilot:

- **Context-Aware Data:** Users in Teams, web, or desktop environments can interact with authorized agents directly, supported by robust Row-Level (RLS) and Column-Level Security (CLS).
- **Collaborative Sharing:** Secure sharing and collaboration features allow users to disseminate insights organization-wide.

## Security and Governance

Data agents respect organizational security boundaries, ensuring:

- **Permission-based Access:** All insights remain governed by user permissions and enterprise security models.
- **Auditability:** Real-time access tracking through MCP endpoints.
