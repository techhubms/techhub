# GitHub Dashboard Feed Page Updated for Better Performance and Consistency

GitHub has enhanced the `/dashboard-feed` page to align with recent improvements made to the homepage "For you" feed. This update offers users a more consistent and performant experience across GitHub.

## What’s New

- **Faster, More Up-to-date Events**: The updated dashboard-feed utilizes GitHub's latest feeds infrastructure. Users will notice improved freshness and reliability in the events displayed.
- **Refreshed Look and Feel**: Events are now presented in a modern, card-based layout, matching the design of the "For you" feed for a unified interface.
- **Expanded Event Types**: The feed now includes a broader set of events, covering announcements, releases, and sponsor activity for improved visibility.
- **Tunable Recommendations**: Users can refine their feed recommendations by selecting the "See less activity like this" option, tailoring the view to their preferences.

## What Remains Unchanged

- **No Filters**: Unlike the "For you" feed, the dashboard-feed page does not offer filtering controls.
- **Chronological Ordering**: Events continue to appear in chronological order, with the newest first, consistent with the update from February 14, 2025.
- **Same Location**: The dashboard-feed is still accessible at [github.com/dashboard-feed](https://github.com/dashboard-feed).

## Reason for Change

Transitioning to the latest feeds infrastructure brings improved event freshness and reliability, and prepares the platform for further enhancements.

## Rollout

The update is rolling out gradually following this announcement.

GitHub encourages users to provide feedback or suggestions by [opening a discussion in the GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions).
