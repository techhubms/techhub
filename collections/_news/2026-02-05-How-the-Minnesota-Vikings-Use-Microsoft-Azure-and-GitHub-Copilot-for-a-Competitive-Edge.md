# How the Minnesota Vikings Use Microsoft Azure and GitHub Copilot for a Competitive Edge

As NFL teams look ahead to future seasons, technology is becoming central to their preparations. The Minnesota Vikings exemplify this approach through their proprietary Viper platform, an advanced, cloud-based video review and analytics tool built in partnership with Microsoft on Azure.

## Azure-Powered Viper Platform

Viper, based on Microsoft Azure, centralizes hundreds of thousands of game, practice, and prospect video files, making them instantly accessible and searchable to coaches, scouts, and analysts. This reduces previously laborious tasks—like cutting video and mailing hard drives—to a streamlined digital process.

- **All-in-one Video Management:** Practice, game, and player evaluation footage is stored securely on Azure, accessible across the organization.
- **Customizable and Iterative:** The platform is constantly updated based on coaching staff and scouting feedback, supporting weekly NFL workflow demands.

## Developer Workflow: GitHub Copilot

The Vikings' development team, led by Luke Burson, leverages GitHub Copilot to quickly develop and deploy new features in response to coaching and scouting needs. Copilot assists with coding tasks, accelerating delivery from request to implementation—sometimes within minutes—allowing the tech team to support rapid, iterative improvement.

## AI and Data Insights

The Viper platform and companion tools, like the Azure AI-powered NFL Combine App, empower staff to:

- Instantly access and filter vast video datasets by player, game situation, or participation
- Use AI for player tracking, prospect evaluation, and scenario analysis
- Combine on-field insights with historical performance data to inform draft, scouting, and free agency strategies

## Secure Access via Microsoft Entra ID

Security is critical. Viper is protected with Microsoft Entra ID, offering:

- **Centralized Authentication:** Single sign-on and role-based access for coaches, scouts, and admins
- **Conditional Access:** Ensures sensitive data is safeguarded from unauthorized access
- **Data Protection:** Player information and strategic assets remain internal, supporting competitive integrity

## Real-World Impact

Coaches report significant improvements in workflow efficiency. Updates and new features are integrated fast, and sensitive information remains secure thanks to Microsoft's cloud and identity solutions.

## Conclusion

By combining Azure, GitHub Copilot, AI, and robust security practices via Entra ID, the Minnesota Vikings use technology not as an afterthought, but as a core asset to gain a 'winning edge' in the NFL.
