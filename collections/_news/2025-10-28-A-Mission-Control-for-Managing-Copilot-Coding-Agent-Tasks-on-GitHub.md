Allison announces GitHub's new centralized mission control for Copilot coding agent tasks, enabling developers to assign, monitor, and guide Copilot-powered coding sessions more efficiently.<!--excerpt_end-->

# A Mission Control for Managing Copilot Coding Agent Tasks on GitHub

GitHub has introduced a redesigned workflow for handling Copilot coding agent tasks directly on github.com. This new centralized 'mission control' interface allows users to assign, guide, and observe Copilot-powered coding sessions without switching between multiple pages.

## Key Features

- **Unified Dashboard:** View all Copilot coding agent activities in a single, streamlined interface. Session logs, overview, and file changes are accessible side-by-side, providing developers with complete context in one location.
- **Real-Time Steering:** Developers can now provide input and steer Copilot sessions as they execute. Feedback is integrated directly into the interface, eliminating the need to manage pull request comments separately. Input can be given either in the chat or in the 'Files changed' view.
- **Effortless Task Management:** Switch between different Copilot tasks, check their status, and jump into the workflow when Copilot requires user input. Quick hyperlinks let users navigate to the relevant pull request instantly.
- **Expanded Task Creation:** Copilot coding agent tasks can now be initiated from multiple locations, including directly on github.com, via the command `/task` in chat, from the Copilot agents panel, and through the GitHub Mobile app's agents task page. There’s also support for custom agents to tailor Copilot’s output.
- **Seamless Workspace Integration:** Developers can continue their work with Copilot in Codespaces, VS Code Insiders (with relevant extensions), or the GitHub CLI, ensuring workflow continuity across preferred environments.

## Setup and Access

- This enhanced Copilot coding agent workflow is available to all users with Copilot agent access.
- Collaboration on Copilot-powered tasks requires write access to the repository.
- For VS Code Insiders, developers should have the latest version installed with both GitHub Copilot Chat and GitHub Pull Requests extensions for full functionality.

## Community Engagement

Feedback and discussion about this new experience are encouraged on the [GitHub Community page](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/177791?utm_source=changelog-community-mission-control&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25).
