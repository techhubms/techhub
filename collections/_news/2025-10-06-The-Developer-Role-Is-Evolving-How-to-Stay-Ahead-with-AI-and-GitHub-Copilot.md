# The Developer Role Is Evolving: How to Stay Ahead with AI and GitHub Copilot

AI is reshaping software engineering, shifting the developer's role towards orchestration, collaboration, and creative problem solving. In this detailed guide, Gwen Davis explores how to adapt and thrive as AI—led by tools like GitHub Copilot—takes on more aspects of code writing and review.

## The Shift Toward AI-Driven Development

Research from Microsoft and GitHub suggests AI will write the majority of code within the next few years, adding the equivalent productivity of millions of new developers to the industry. While AI automates boilerplate coding, human strengths—creativity, judgment, and collaboration—become even more essential.

## Evolving Developer Value

- **Orchestrators not just coders**: Future developers will focus less on manual typing, more on defining intent, guiding AI, and integrating AI outputs into real software solutions.
- **Critical skills**: Context provision, big-picture thinking, and cross-team communication are rising in value.
- **Job security**: Technical uncertainty is high, but strengthening orchestration and strategic thinking skills builds resilience.

## Skill #1: Improving AI Coding with Context

AI's suggestions depend on the context you provide. [GitHub Copilot Spaces](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-copilot-spaces/create-copilot-spaces) lets teams upload sources, set project intent, and collaborate, resulting in accurate, tailored code suggestions.

**How to use Copilot Spaces:**

1. Visit [github.com/copilot/spaces](http://github.com/copilot/spaces) to start a new space.
2. Upload documentation, sample code, or repositories to inform Copilot.
3. Ask Copilot questions—context-rich queries yield more relevant outputs.

*Tip: Enable organization-wide Copilot Spaces for unified team context.*

## Skill #2: Adding Human Insight and Strategy

AI can automate code generation and review, but developers add value by combining machine efficiency with insight and judgment. [GitHub Copilot Code Review](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/request-a-code-review/use-code-review) helps teams scale code review, catch issues early, and streamline feedback loops.

**How to use Copilot Code Review:**

1. Request Copilot as a reviewer on a pull request.
2. Assess suggestions and inline comments Copilot provides.
3. Refine by accepting, rejecting, or customizing feedback via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

*Tip: Automate Copilot reviews for all pull requests and refine to fit your workflow.*

## Skill #3: Embracing Continuous Learning

The pace of change in AI and programming is accelerating. Staying current means continually updating your skills, not just in AI frameworks but also in open source collaboration and personal branding.

**Practical steps to grow your AI skill set:**

- Learn Python and expand into Java, C++, and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.
- Master machine learning basics and contribute to open source ML repositories.
- Organize your GitHub portfolio—publish READMEs, contribute code, and use GitHub Pages.
- Pursue [GitHub Copilot certification](https://learn.github.com/certification/COPILOT) to demonstrate your expertise.

*Tip: Public contributions and badges showcase your adaptability to employers.*

## GitHub Universe: Learn Directly from the Experts

The article highlights sessions from the upcoming GitHub Universe conference, focused on:

- Leveraging AI-powered tools in software development
- Designing with AI agents and understanding context
- Scaling collaboration with Copilot code review
- Hearing from engineering leaders at GitHub, Microsoft, and industry partners

## Key Takeaways

- The developer role is shifting toward orchestration, strategy, and collaboration with AI companions.
- Context is fundamental—Copilot performs best when informed by relevant sources and project intent.
- Continuous learning and public demonstration of skills are critical for career resilience.
- GitHub Copilot's expanding capabilities (Spaces, Code Review, certification) are central tools for modern software professionals.
