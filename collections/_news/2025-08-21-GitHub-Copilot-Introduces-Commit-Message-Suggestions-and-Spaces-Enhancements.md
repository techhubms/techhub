# GitHub Copilot Generated Commit Messages and Spaces Enhancements Now in Public Preview

GitHub Copilot now helps streamline documentation by offering contextual commit message suggestions when making file changes directly on github.com. This enhancement means developers can receive automatically generated, concise summaries of their changes, making the commit process faster and more effortless.

**Key Features:**

- **Contextual Commit Message Suggestions:**
  - Copilot generates suggested commit messages based on file changes made in the github.com editor.
  - File deletions and empty file additions continue to use default messages (`Delete filename`, `Add filename`).
- **Availability:**
  - Available to all Copilot Free and paid subscribers.
  - Does not consume usage quota.
- **Enterprise Features:**
  - Enterprises can enable public preview features via the Copilot in github.com settings.
  - If enterprise rulesets for commit metadata are enabled, defaults will still be used for certain commits.
  - Feature is also available in GitHub Enterprise Cloud, including with data residency support.
- **Community and Feedback:**
  - Join the [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/170558).
  - Share your feedback via [this form](https://forms.gle/pBtcV9BCAgq7udMV9).

## GitHub Copilot Spaces Enhancements

GitHub Copilot Spaces has also received several new features to improve context and integration with your workflow:

- **Link an Entire Repository:** Associate a full repository with your Copilot Space for broader suggestions.
- **Add a Code File via URL or Code View:** Bring in files directly to provide more context.
- **Directory Selection:** Watch an entire directory and all future files added to it.
- **Branch Selection:** Specify branches to track relevant changes.

*Note: All features are currently in public preview; UI may change over time.*
