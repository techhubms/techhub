# NZ North: One Year of Building New Zealand's AI Future with Microsoft Cloud

December marks one year since Microsoft opened its first hyperscale cloud region in New Zealand, a pivotal event that has accelerated the country’s adoption of cloud and AI technologies. Over the past twelve months, Microsoft has partnered with organizations across sectors, empowering them to scale their operations, innovate with confidence, and deliver greater value to their customers and communities.

## Key Partnerships and Transformational Stories

- **Spark**: Microsoft's collaboration with Spark centered on accelerating the telecommunications company's AI strategy, modernizing its network, and optimizing operations. A landmark public cloud partnership positioned Spark to leverage AI for new revenue streams, with Copilot deployed to 2,500 workers to elevate productivity and customer service.
- **Te Pūkenga & Creative Sector**: Working with the New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology and Auckland Council, Microsoft supported the Te Puna Creative Hub to provide technology-focused micro-credentials, strengthening the local workforce for digital opportunities.
- **Whakarongorau Aotearoa**: As New Zealand’s national telehealth provider, this organization significantly cut IT and admin costs by moving to Microsoft's datacenter region. The deployment of Copilot and other AI tools saved staff time, improved reporting cycles, and enabled the use of AI agents to support human-led services for vital health access. Their focus remains on enhancing—not replacing—human care through technology.

## AI and Digital Skills for Economic Growth

New Zealand’s tech exports are increasing, and Microsoft has committed to upskilling 100,000 New Zealanders for the digital economy by 2027. These initiatives aim to close skill gaps and ensure that the workforce is prepared to harness AI and digital tools for sustainable economic growth.

## Climate Impact and Sustainability

The datacenter region operates using 100% renewable energy and features water-free cooling. This move toward sustainability supports public sector climate objectives, offering cloud-based solutions that can cut the sector’s carbon footprint by an estimated 11%.

## Real-World AI Integration

Across sectors, early adopters are using AI-assisted tools—such as Copilot and planned Fabric integrations—to streamline operations and improve service delivery. Public entities like Christchurch City Council have modernized digital infrastructure, supporting better public engagement and service insight.

## Foundations for the Future

Microsoft’s presence is accelerating the pace at which organizations can test, deploy, and scale new AI-driven solutions while maintaining a strong focus on people, community, and equity. The story of NZ North’s first year is one of foundational progress: preparing the country for wider AI adoption, driving real-time data usage across services, and ensuring responsible, values-driven innovation for the future.
