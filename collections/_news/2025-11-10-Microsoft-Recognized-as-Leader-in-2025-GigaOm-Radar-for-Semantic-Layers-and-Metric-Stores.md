# Microsoft Recognized as Leader in 2025 GigaOm Radar for Semantic Layers & Metric Stores

Semantic models are essential to delivering trusted analytics, providing business logic, metrics, and relationships that transform raw data into curated insights. As organizations increasingly leverage generative AI, these semantic layers supply the structure and context required for accurate, reliable AI outputs.

Microsoft has refined its semantic platforms over nearly two decades, evolving from Analysis Services to the current Power BI and Microsoft Fabric offerings. What started as a foundation for reporting has become an intelligence layer driving AI and analytics across today's data ecosystems. Currently, Power BI’s semantic models support over 35 million active users monthly, demonstrating their global impact.

Recently, Microsoft was named both a Leader and Outperformer in the 2025 GigaOm Radar for Semantic Layers & Metric Stores. This recognition highlights Microsoft's focus on building a semantic platform that meets both enterprise and AI-driven needs. According to GigaOm, Microsoft stands out for providing comprehensive governance, ease of use, open architecture, and continuous innovation—particularly for GenAI integration through capabilities like Verified Answers and semantic link features.

The report praised how Microsoft unifies semantic modeling across business intelligence, data science, and AI workflows, cementing Power BI’s position as a strategic platform for modern analytics. Microsoft continues to invest in new features to broaden the capabilities of semantic models, supporting both self-service and enterprise-grade scenarios.

Whether you are a BI engineer, data analyst, or business user, Power BI’s semantic models offer a reliable and governed foundation for analytics and AI.
