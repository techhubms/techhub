# Microsoft Expands Sovereign Cloud Capabilities with New Services and AI Integration

## Overview

Microsoft continues to evolve its Sovereign Cloud strategy to address regulatory, security, and data residency challenges faced by organizations worldwide. The newly announced services strengthen digital sovereignty controls and empower government, public sector, and highly regulated enterprise customers to harness advanced Azure capabilities without compromising compliance.

## Key Highlights

- **AI and Data Residency Enhancements**:
  - Azure now offers end-to-end AI data-processing within the European Union Data Boundary, guaranteeing that customer data (at rest and in transit) for AI services remains inside the EU unless otherwise specified by the customer.
  - Thousands of prebuilt and open-source AI models—such as GPT OSS, DeepSeek-V3, Mistral NeMo, and Llama 4 Maverick—can now be run on the latest NVIDIA RTX GPUs in sovereign private cloud environments to empower secure, high-performance AI workloads.

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot Improvements**:
  - Expansion of in-country data processing for Copilot interactions to 15 countries, ensuring enhanced privacy and data sovereignty for Microsoft 365 customers.
  - General availability of Microsoft 365 Local for deploying Exchange Server, SharePoint Server, and Skype for Business Server on Azure Local, supporting both connected and fully disconnected modes for isolated compliance scenarios.

- **Sovereign Landing Zones (SLZ)**:
  - Refreshed SLZ built atop Azure Landing Zone (ALZ), providing prescriptive architectural guidance, policy definitions, and accelerators for implementing sovereign controls from the earliest stages of cloud design.
  - Includes new management group hierarchies and Azure Policy automation for regulatory compliance.

- **Azure Local and Infrastructure Advancements**:
  - Azure Local supports scaling from clusters of 16 servers up to hundreds, supported by SAN integration to connect on-premises storage securely.
  - Introduction of disconnected operations, enabling private clouds managed with local, on-premised control planes for autonomous, highly regulated operations.

- **Security and Compliance Focus**:
  - Programs such as the European Security Program and the launch of a European board of directors underscore Microsoft's commitment to operational sovereignty and regional compliance.
  - Embedded digital resiliency commitments and advancements in open‑source security investment.

- **Partner Ecosystem and National Partner Clouds**:
  - Digital Sovereignty specialization for Microsoft partners to demonstrate expertise in building secure, compliant cloud solutions.
  - Collaboration with Bleu (France) and Delos (Germany) to deliver independently operated national partner clouds meeting strict local requirements, with SAP’s RISE offering expanding on these platforms.

## Upcoming Innovations

- **Data Guardian**: Tamper-evident logs and EU-based oversight for all remote access by Microsoft engineers in European cloud environments.
- **Enhanced Change Controls in Private Cloud**: Fine-grained policy and approval workflows for explicit oversight of infrastructure changes.
- **Disaster Recovery and Disconnected Operations**: Azure Site Recovery and progression from hybrid to fully offline (disconnected) operations support robust business continuity.

## Continuous Investment

Microsoft reaffirms its commitment to unmatched sovereign solutions, funding increased European datacenter capacity, and fostering open-source collaboration. Organizations are invited to learn more and discover new innovations at Microsoft Ignite.
