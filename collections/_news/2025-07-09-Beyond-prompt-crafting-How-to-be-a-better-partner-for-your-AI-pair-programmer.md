In this article, Christopher Harrison discusses the importance of providing proper context to Copilot, Microsoft's AI pair programming tool, to ensure high-quality code suggestions. <!--excerpt_end--> While crafting effective prompts is part of using Copilot, Harrison emphasizes that the real key lies in giving Copilot enough relevant information about your specific project, coding standards, and goals. This additional context allows Copilot to generate suggestions that are better aligned with your intended outcome, resulting in improved code quality and a more productive development experience. The article highlights best practices for maximizing Copilot's effectiveness through thoughtful interactions and clear, context-rich communication.
