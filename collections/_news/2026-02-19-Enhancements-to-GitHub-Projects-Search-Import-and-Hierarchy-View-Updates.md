# Enhancements to GitHub Projects: Search Import and Hierarchy View Updates

## Import Project Items with a Search Query

GitHub Projects now allows you to add items when creating a new project by defining a search query. In addition to the existing option of importing directly from a repository, this feature enables you to use the [same advanced filters](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#building-advanced-filters-for-issues) available on the Issues page. Supported filters include logical operations (`AND`/`OR`) and nested queries. This results in a more precise and controlled project setup, letting you start with exactly the issues and pull requests relevant to your needs.

## Hierarchy View Improvements

Building on the public preview of hierarchy view, several improvements have been made based on user feedback:

- **Inline Creation and Addition:** You can now create and add sub-issues directly from within a project.
- **Reordering and Parenting:** Sub-issues can be reorganized via drag-and-drop, making nesting and organization much easier.
- **Synchronization:** The order of sub-issues remains in sync between the main issues view and project boards.

### Upcoming Features

GitHub is continuing to iterate on hierarchy view with planned improvements including:

- Avoiding duplicate issues in the hierarchy when they already appear elsewhere
- Preserving expand/collapse states between sessions
- Adding filtering options for sub-issues (such as displaying only open sub-issues)
