# Microsoft’s $15.2 Billion USD Investment in AI and Cloud Innovation in the UAE

Microsoft has announced a significant long-term investment totaling $15.2 billion USD in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to drive advancements in AI, cloud infrastructure, and digital talent development. This initiative, launched in partnership with G42—the UAE’s sovereign AI company—brings together technology, talent, and trust to support both the UAE’s strategic vision and economic growth, and to foster strong ties with the United States.

## Investment Highlights

- **Total Investment:** $15.2 billion between 2023 and 2029

  - More than $7.9 billion planned between 2026 and 2029 for continued AI/cloud infrastructure expansion and operating expenses.

## AI and Cloud Infrastructure

- **Data Center Expansion:** Microsoft is deploying advanced GPUs (Nvidia A100, H100, H200, and GB300 chips) to provide the compute power needed for AI models and workloads. Export licenses from the US Commerce Department allow shipment of these chips, subject to strict cybersecurity and export control regulations.
- **Access to Cutting-Edge Models:** The UAE hosts infrastructure supporting AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and open-source providers, powering AI-enabled applications across sectors.
- **AI Usage Leadership:** According to the Microsoft [AI Diffusion Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/aiei/ai-diffusion/), the UAE leads globally in generative AI usage per capita, with over 59% of the population using such technologies.

## Talent Development

- **Growing Local Workforce:** Nearly 1,000 Microsoft employees in the UAE, representing 40 nationalities, with almost 100 engineers and support from an ecosystem of 1,400 partners employing 45,000 professionals.
- **Engineering Development Center:** New facility in Abu Dhabi attracting global tech talent to develop AI/cloud products, with an emphasis on domain-specific models and scientific advances.
- **AI for Good Lab:** A new research center supporting humanitarian AI projects, collaborating with universities, non-profits, startups, and governments to solve regional challenges and train large language models for underrepresented languages in Africa.
- **Skilling Initiatives:** Commitment to upskill 1 million UAE residents by 2027, including government employees, students, and teachers, through programs with GEMS, ADEK, and KHDA.

## Responsible AI and Trust Frameworks

- **Responsible AI Future Foundation:** In partnership with G42 and MBZUAI, this foundation advances responsible AI standards and best practices across the Middle East and Global South, focusing on ethical frameworks, safety, and cultural inclusivity.
- **Abu Dhabi Global AI Summit:** Gathering public and private sector leaders to address the challenges and opportunities of AI diffusion, emphasizing collaboration and the closing of technology gaps across regions.
- **Intergovernmental Assurance Agreement (IGAA):** Binding compliance framework between Microsoft and G42, developed with input from US and UAE governments, covering cybersecurity, KYC, export controls, data protection, and responsible AI standards.

## Looking Ahead

Microsoft’s ongoing investment in the UAE is a commitment to foster technical, social, and economic opportunity. By expanding world-class AI and cloud infrastructure, nurturing local talent, and supporting ethical AI practices, Microsoft and its local partners aim to empower people, businesses, and public institutions throughout the Middle East and beyond.
