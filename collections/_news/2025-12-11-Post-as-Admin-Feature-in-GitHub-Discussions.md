Allison explains how GitHub now allows repository administrators to post in Discussions with an 'Admin' badge, helping clarify official guidance for the community.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Post as Admin Feature in GitHub Discussions

GitHub has introduced a new capability for repository administrators, allowing them to post and comment in GitHub Discussions with an "Admin" badge. This enables clear differentiation between official repository responses and personal input.

## Feature Overview

- **Admin Badge:** Administrators can choose to post as themselves or as "Admin." Replies posted as Admin are easily recognized by community members as official guidance.
- **No Need for Separate Accounts:** Previously, some communities created separate admin accounts for this purpose, which created security and access management challenges. The new feature addresses these issues by leveraging existing permissions.
- **Community Benefits:** This distinction helps in identifying authoritative responses and maintaining healthy community engagement.

## How to Use the Admin Badge

1. **Administrator Permissions:** Ensure you have administrator rights for the repository.
2. **Discussions Enabled:** The repository must have GitHub Discussions enabled.
3. **Posting as Admin:** When starting a new discussion or replying to a thread, select "Admin" from the dropdown menu to post using the badge.

For more details, refer to [GitHub Docs: Managing Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions).

## Availability

- This feature is now available on github.com for all repositories with Discussions enabled.

## Benefits

- **Authority:** Community members can quickly spot official guidance.
- **Security:** Reduces the need for shared admin accounts and associated risks.
- **Flexibility:** Maintainers retain the ability to participate personally or officially as needed.
