Kedasha Kerr, from the GitHub Developer Advocacy team, explores how open source and AI tools like GitHub Copilot help developers create impactful personal apps and streamline workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Building Personal Apps with Open Source and AI

## Simplifying Workflows with Small Tools

Kedasha Kerr, a member of the GitHub Developer Advocacy team, emphasizes the value of building small, purpose-driven tools that automate manual tasks. Examples include scripts to format user submissions or convert CSV files to Markdown, both providing significant time savings and reducing cognitive load.

> _'It doesn’t need to be a Swiss Army knife. It could be just like a really good scissors or paring knife.'_

These simple automations demonstrate how even mundane-seeming scripts can free up mental energy for more creative work.

## Open Source: Collaboration and Growth

The open source community offers a collaborative environment for developers to share and improve tools. By making projects public, developers invite others to contribute, suggest features, or fork code to suit their own needs. This community-driven approach not only enhances the tool but also inspires broader problem-solving and learning.

- Example: Features like a 'resume' button in a to-do app originated from user suggestions.
- Forking projects allows personalized adaptations and encourages experimentation.

## AI as a Force Multiplier

AI tools, especially GitHub Copilot, are described as accelerators that lower the barriers to building software. Whether scaffolding projects, understanding codebases, or resolving errors, AI acts as a facilitator that helps developers — even those inexperienced in certain domains — to quickly bring ideas to life.

- AI assists with project setup, debugging, and understanding code.
- Developers share stories of building dashboards and apps with AI assistance, even without deep frontend experience.

## Enhancing Joy and Reducing Friction

The main benefit of personal automation is not just time saved, but the decrease in mental overhead. With reliable automation in place, developers can focus on creative or meaningful tasks instead of repetitive work. AI tools further reduce frustration, making building software a more enjoyable and rewarding process.

## Security, Sharing, and Responsibility

Kerr highlights the importance of security and maintainability as projects transition from personal use to open source. Community involvement is crucial here: contributors identify issues, suggest improvements, and help guide the project's evolution. Clear contribution guidelines empower others to fork and enhance tools as needed.

## Conclusion

Building, sharing, and iterating on personal tools is deeply rewarding for developers. By leveraging both open source models and AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, developers can efficiently create tailored solutions and positively impact the broader community.
