# Automating Security Vulnerability Triage with GitHub Security Lab Taskflow Agent

**By Man Yue Mo**

Triaging security alerts—especially for large open source repositories—can be tedious, repetitive, and resource-intensive. False positives often arise due to patterns humans can catch quickly but static analyzers struggle to codify. The GitHub Security Lab Taskflow Agent leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and an open source taskflow framework to automate these repetitive checks and streamline the triage process.

## What is the Taskflow Agent?

The Taskflow Agent is an open source framework from GitHub Security Lab that lets security teams define YAML-based sequences (taskflows) for LLMs to perform. Tasks include fetching alerts, evaluating code scanning results, performing stepwise audits, and reporting.

Key features:

- **Task Chaining:** Each triage task is broken into focused sub-steps, which LLMs process one at a time—reducing context window issues and increasing reliability.
- **Actionable Reports:** Reports include code references, line numbers, and justifications directly in GitHub Issues, keeping triage transparent and reproducible.
- **Programmatic & LLM Delegation:** Routine checks (e.g., workflow permissions, triggers) are handled by MCP server tools, while semantic logic (finding permission checks) is left to the LLM.

## Example Triage Workflow

1. **Alert Collection:** The system fetches alerts from CodeQL scans across selected repositories.
2. **Trigger & Permission Analysis:** Evaluates triggering events, workflow permissions, and disabled state to quickly filter non-critical or unreachable alerts.
3. **Injection Point Inspection:** Checks if code injection points are valid, sanitize untrusted inputs, and confirm code reachability.
4. **Workflow User Analysis:** Determines which workflow users are affected, and inspects if workflows can be triggered in a privileged context.
5. **Audit & False Positive Filtering:** LLMs use the compiled evidence to discard false positives based on established rule sets.
6. **Report Generation & Validation:** Structures human-verifiable reports with code snippets and clear rationales. An LLM audits the draft for completeness before issues are created.
7. **Feedback Loop:** Dismissal reasons and reviewer comments on issues provide future prompt improvements, enhancing accuracy over time.

## Insights for Engineers

- **Decompose Repetitive Tasks:** Break down manual reviews into atomic, automatable steps for LLM-friendly flows.
- **Store Intermediate State:** Storing each sub-task's results improves reliability and facilitates debugging/resumption.
- **Apply Repo-Specific Knowledge:** Use past false positive analyses (alert dismissal reasons) for better future triage.
- **Leverage Both Automation & Human Review:** Always review AI-generated reports before remediation takes place.

## Taskflow Development Tips

- Prefer small, independent tasks over complex, monolithic prompts.
- Use reusable task and prompt definitions to ensure changes propagate across workflows easily.
- Configure LLM models centrally for easier upgrades.

## Real Results

Applying these taskflows has allowed the lab to triage hundreds of alerts, quickly identifying ~30 new real-world vulnerabilities in open source, while discarding many false positives. Transparent documentation and actionable issues speed up the remediation cycle.

**Disclaimer:** All reports are subject to researcher review before escalation. Running taskflows at scale may incur Quota and API usage—always check with repo maintainers before automation.
