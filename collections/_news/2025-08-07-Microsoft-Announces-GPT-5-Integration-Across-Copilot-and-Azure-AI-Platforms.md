# Microsoft Announces GPT-5 Integration Across Copilot and Azure AI Platforms

**Author:** Satya Nadella (Chairman and CEO at Microsoft)

Today, Microsoft has launched GPT-5, integrating this advanced language model across several flagship platforms, including:

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot**
- **GitHub Copilot**
- **Copilot** (General)
- **Azure AI Foundry**

## Key Highlights

- **Enhanced Capabilities:** GPT-5 delivers significant advances in reasoning, code generation, and conversational intelligence, designed to accelerate productivity and creativity for both developers and enterprises.
- **Built on Azure:** The latest model builds upon deep collaboration with OpenAI and is fully trained and deployed on Microsoft Azure infrastructure, ensuring enterprise-grade scalability and reliability.
- **Unified AI Experience:** Integration into Copilot platforms means these AI advances will now be available directly within everyday workflows for users of Microsoft 365, developers using GitHub, and organizations deploying solutions on Azure AI Foundry.

> *“It’s hard to believe it’s only been two and a half years since Sam Altman joined us in Redmond to show the world GPT-4 for the first time in Bing, and it’s incredible to see how far we’ve come since that moment. The pace of progress is only accelerating, and I can’t wait to see what developers, enterprises, and consumers will do with this latest breakthrough.”*
