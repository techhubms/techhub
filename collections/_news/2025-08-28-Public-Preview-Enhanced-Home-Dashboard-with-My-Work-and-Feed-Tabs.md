# Public Preview: Enhanced Home Dashboard with My Work and Feed Tabs

## Overview

GitHub is rolling out a public preview of improvements to the home dashboard, aimed at helping users monitor and access their most important work from a single location. These updates focus on making key information—such as pull requests and issues—more visible and actionable.

## What's New

- **My Work Tab**: Displays a concise, customizable list of the user's most recently updated pull requests and issues.
  - Filtering options to personalize which work items are shown
  - For authored pull requests, actionable next steps are surfaced
- **Feed Tab**: Retains the earlier feed view. User's tab selection is now persistent for a streamlined experience
- The changes are available to a subset of users, with broader rollout planned as feedback is gathered

*Note: Features in public preview may evolve based on user feedback.*

These enhancements are geared toward improving productivity by reducing the time needed to locate and act on critical work items. The simplified organization of 'My Work' and 'Feed' seeks to meet the needs of developers looking for faster navigation and better visibility into their workflow.
