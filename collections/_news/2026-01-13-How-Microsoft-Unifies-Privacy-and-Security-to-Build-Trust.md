# How Microsoft Unifies Privacy and Security to Build Trust

*By Terrell Cox, Vice President for Microsoft Security and Deputy CISO for Privacy and Policy*

## Introduction

Microsoft’s approach to privacy and security is rooted in trust—a trust built through technological rigor, global compliance, and the principle that privacy and security strengthen each other. This article provides practical guidance from Microsoft’s Deputy CISO on how privacy and security are implemented together across products, policies, and emerging regulatory frameworks.

## Microsoft’s Trust-Centric Philosophy

- Microsoft is recognized as a top trusted brand, emphasizing respect, accountability, and integrity.
- Regulatory compliance is ingrained with frequent audits and internal reviews.
- The [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center) centralizes privacy, compliance, and security resources.

## Treating Privacy and Security as Complementary

- Privacy is treated as a human right, safeguarded in every Microsoft offering from Microsoft 365 to Azure.
- Security and privacy are viewed as inseparable: protecting data (privacy) with robust boundaries (security) without intrusive inspection.
- Data ownership and control remain with the customer; Microsoft commits not to mine customer data for advertising.
- Data residency and global compliance are managed with strict legal protocols for data requests.

## Technologies Underpinning Privacy and Security

- **[Microsoft Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra):** Powers identity validation and Zero Trust Network Access via features like Private Access.
- **[Microsoft Purview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-purview):** Delivers information protection and governance—automating classification, labeling, discovery, policy enforcement, and compliance reporting across platforms.
- **[Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/cloud-security/microsoft-defender-cloud):** Shields data and workloads across hybrid and multicloud environments.
- **Conditional Access & Customer Lockbox:** Fine-grained access based on user/device risk; customer authorization/auditing for data access by Microsoft engineers.

## Secure Future Initiative

- Security strategy is to "assume breach" and enforce continuous authentication, least privilege, and robust oversight.
- Secure operational practices include jump hosts, multifactor authentication, and just-in-time access gates.

## Regulatory Compliance and Innovation

- Microsoft responds proactively to global regulations:
  - **GDPR:** Early adopter, offers data subject rights, breach notifications, consent management, and global extension of protections.
  - **DPDP (India):** Local data residency and consent management embedded into Azure.
  - **NIS2, DORA (EU):** Operational resilience and critical sector protection delivered via Defender for Cloud.
  - **EU AI Act:** Responsible AI governance managed with Purview, while Defender for Cloud secures AI workloads.
- Compliance is seen as a driver for technical improvement, not just a legal obligation.
- Company-wide privacy frameworks established with accountability by business unit and organizational role.

## Specific Practices and Tools

- Advertising/data deletion protocols to enforce Data Subject Requests (DSRs).
- Global extension of data minimization, access, correction, deletion, and export rights.
- Investment in frameworks that integrate privacy, security, and compliance consistently across product lines.

## Resources and Further Learning

- [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center)
- [Microsoft Security Blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog)
- [Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-compliance-manager)
- [OCISO blog series](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/topic/office-of-the-ciso/)

## Conclusion

Microsoft’s leadership in privacy and security comes from treating both as core, intertwined technical disciplines. Global regulations have been used as catalysts for innovation, making Microsoft’s ecosystem well-positioned to handle evolving data protection and security demands for organizations of any size.
