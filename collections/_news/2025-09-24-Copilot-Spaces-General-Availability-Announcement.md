# Copilot Spaces is Now Generally Available

GitHub has officially launched Copilot Spaces, a powerful new way to enhance Copilot's understanding of your projects. With Copilot Spaces, you can aggregate key context—such as files, pull requests, issues, and repositories—enabling Copilot to generate more relevant code, provide system design explanations, and suggest solutions that adhere to your team's standards.

## Key Features

- **Curated Project Context:** Add files, docs, pull requests, and issues to a Copilot Space, grounding Copilot’s responses in specific project knowledge.
- **Custom Instructions:** Tailor Copilot’s answers further by adding custom instructions related to your workflows.
- **Collaboration Across Teams:** Spaces allow teams to collaboratively share and access project knowledge, reducing repeated explanations and centralizing updates, schemas, and documentation.
- **Always in Sync:** Attach your code directly from your GitHub repository; files and repositories in a space stay synchronized as the source changes.
- **IDE Integration:** Spaces are now accessible directly within your IDE, connected via the [remote GitHub MCP server](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp/use-the-github-mcp-server).

## Example Use Cases

- Generating code that automatically follows security, API, and team standards.
- Sharing templates, schemas, or best practices for databases, telemetry, or authentication.
- Improving onboarding by allowing new developers access to project-specific resources immediately.
- Centralizing project planning documents, product requirements, and technical decisions.

## Getting Started
