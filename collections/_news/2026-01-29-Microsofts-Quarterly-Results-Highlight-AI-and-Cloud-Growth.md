# Microsoft's Quarterly Results: Cloud and AI Milestones

**Author:** Satya Nadella (original post summarized)

Microsoft's latest quarterly report highlights significant achievements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the proliferation of their Copilot family of products:

## Highlights

- **Cloud Growth:** Quarterly cloud revenue surpassed $50B for the first time, up from $10B annually less than a decade ago.
- **AI Scale:** Microsoft's AI business has surpassed earlier core franchises in breadth and adoption, signaling rapid diffusion.
- **Token Efficiency:** Focus on "tokens per watt and per dollar," optimizing both infrastructure utilization and total cost of ownership (TCO). Notably, a 50% throughput increase was achieved in high-volume workloads like OpenAI inferencing powering Copilot services.
- **Custom Silicon:** Rollout of new first-party systems (e.g., Maia 200) continues, in pursuit of better economics and innovation.

## AI Platform Initiatives

- **Agent Platform:** The next wave of app development centers on autonomous agents. Microsoft delivers:
  - Model catalogs (Anthropic and OpenAI already in use)
  - Orchestration harnesses
  - Context engineering
  - AI safety and observability tools
- **Customer Adoption:** 1,500+ customers leveraging both Anthropic and OpenAI models via Foundry; 250+ customers will process over 1T tokens on Foundry this year.
- **Fabric:** Microsoft's Microsoft Fabric product is gaining momentum, hitting a $2B annual run rate for advanced analytics and data integration.
- **Agent 365:** New offerings in governance, identity, security, and management for AI agents, extending enterprise controls and compliance.

## Copilot Ecosystem Momentum

- **Consumer Copilot:** Daily active users of consumer Copilot app have tripled year-over-year.
- **Productivity Copilot:** 15M+ paid Microsoft 365 Copilot seats; many more using enterprise chat capabilities.
- **GitHub Copilot:** 4.7M paid GitHub Copilot subscriptions, a 75% year-over-year increase, highlighting massive growth among developers.
- **Healthcare Applications:** Over 21M patient encounters documented with Copilot-powered workflows in the last year, tripling previous numbers.

## Strategic Vision

- As AI diffuses across computing and business workflows, Microsoft anticipates expanding their total addressable market (TAM) at all technology stack levels.
- The focus is on delivering value through technical innovation and accelerating adoption for customers.
