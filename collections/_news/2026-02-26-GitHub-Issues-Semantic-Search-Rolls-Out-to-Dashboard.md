# GitHub Issues Semantic Search Rolls Out to Dashboard

GitHub is rolling out an improved semantic search feature in public preview for the issues dashboard, allowing users to use natural language queries to find relevant issues across their repositories.

Key details:

- **Semantic Search:** Users can search for issues using conversational language, making it easier to locate relevant discussions and bug reports. This augmentation follows positive community feedback from the earlier release for the issues index.
- **Repository Limit:** For dashboard searches not limited to a single repository, semantic search currently covers a user's top 100 repositories.
- **Fallback Behavior:** Filter-only and exact-match (quotation marks) searches will continue to use traditional lexical search.
- **Preview Banner:** A banner announces the preview, and users may revert to classic search as needed.

### Additional GitHub Issues and Projects Improvements

- **Label and Milestone Permissions:** Now, users with permission to apply, but not create, labels or milestones will not see the “Create new” option, simplifying the interface.
- **Sub-Issue Feedback:** Creating sub-issues now displays a loading state for better feedback as the form loads.
- **Project Agent Assignment Bug Fix:** Assigning third-party agents to issues now reliably triggers them to begin work immediately.
- **Navigation Optimization:** To accelerate browsing, GitHub Projects has removed the count from the top navigation bar when viewing repositories, improving site-wide page load times.
