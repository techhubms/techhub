# Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake: Unifying Security Signals and Powering Agentic AI

*Authors: Scott Woodgate and Krishna Kumar Parthasarathy*

## Overview

Security operations teams face a persistent challenge: managing vast, rapidly growing datasets while controlling costs. Traditional data management infrastructure often struggles to scale sustainably to these levels, making it difficult for teams to retain and analyze critical security data.

To address this, Microsoft is evolving its industry-leading Security Incidents and Event Management (SIEM) solution—[Microsoft Sentinel](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel/)—to incorporate a **modern, cost-effective data lake**. This addition, now available in public preview, aims to unify all your security data, enabling much deeper insights and accelerating the adoption of AI-driven threat detection and response.

## Key Features

- **Unified Security Data**: The Sentinel data lake centralizes all security-related signals, improving correlation and analysis across your environment.
- **Cost-Effective Storage**: The solution is designed to scale efficiently, allowing teams to retain more data without prohibitive cost—eliminating the need to choose between budget and data retention.
- **Accelerated Agentic AI Adoption**: By having all signals in one place, security teams can leverage advanced AI models for unparalleled visibility, faster detection, and effective response to emerging threats.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Enhanced visibility empowers security teams to act quickly and make better-informed decisions.

## Benefits

- **No More Trade-offs**: Retain critical security data while staying within budget constraints.
- **Faster, AI-Powered Response**: Unified, accessible data supports advanced analytics and agentic AI capabilities, accelerating detection and incident response workflows.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Get a holistic view of your security landscape by bringing all signals together—improving accuracy and reducing blind spots.

## Getting Started

Microsoft Sentinel data lake is available in public preview. To learn more or to begin taking advantage of these capabilities, visit the [Microsoft Sentinel Data Lake documentation](https://aka.ms/sentineldatalakedocs).
