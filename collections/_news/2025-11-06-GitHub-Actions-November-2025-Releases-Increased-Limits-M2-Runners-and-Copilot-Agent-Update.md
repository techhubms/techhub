# GitHub Actions November 2025 Releases: Increased Limits, M2 Runners, and Copilot Agent Update

## Increased Limits for Reusable Workflows

- **Reusable Workflow Expansion:** You can now nest up to 10 reusable workflows and call up to 50 workflows from a single workflow run. (Previous limits were 4 and 20, respectively.)
- **Impact:** Enables larger-scale automation scenarios and facilitates improved collaboration across development teams.

## M2 macOS Runners Generally Available

- **New Hardware:** M2-powered macOS runners are now available. Use the labels `macos-latest-xlarge`, `macos-15-xlarge`, `macos-14-xlarge`, or `macos-13-xlarge` to schedule jobs on these runners.
- **Benefits:** Gain improved performance metrics and GPU acceleration, useful for workflows that require higher compute or graphics capabilities.

## Copilot Coding Agent Requirement Change

- **Simplified Setup:** GitHub Copilot's coding agent no longer requires GitHub Actions to be enabled for your organization.
- **Advantage:** Easier access and more flexible integration of Copilot's AI-powered coding features into repositories, boosting developer productivity.
