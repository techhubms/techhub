# What’s New in Copilot Studio: July 2025

*By stclarke*

Microsoft Copilot Studio receives several major updates this July, continuing to enhance the AI-powered agent platform for enterprises and makers alike. From advanced natural language models to deeper data integrations and improved governance, here's a detailed look at the latest features and enhancements.

---

## Copilot Studio New Features and Enhancements

### 1. Native Advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU+)

- **New NLU+ Option:** Users can now train advanced, high-accuracy natural language understanding models within Copilot Studio, eliminating the need for external services or complex setup.
- **Customization:** Configure custom topics, entities, and examples for fine-tuned intent recognition; add synonyms and entity items for improved recognition and speech support.
- **Use Cases:** Designed for high-volume agent scenarios, such as customer care centers, ensuring predictable, trained responses.
- **Requirements:** Available with a Dynamics 365 Contact Center license.

*Get started: Navigate to Settings > Natural Language and select NLU+ as the orchestration engine. Upload, annotate, train, and test—all in one interface.*

### 2. Fabric Data Agents Integration

- **Fabric Data Agents:** AI assistants that connect to Microsoft OneLake, understanding schemas, enforcing governance, and delivering business-contextual insights within Copilot Studio.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Unlike static knowledge sources, Fabric data agents provide near-real-time, governed answers directly from the analytics layer.
- **Collaboration:** Leverage Model Context Protocols for multi-agent collaboration, such as combining inventory forecasts and compliance checks into a single conversation.
- **Benefits:** Accelerate innovation, maintain consistency, and empower users with up-to-date, governed information where they work.

### 3. In-Agent Element Search

- **Feature:** New search functionality allows users to find any component (nodes, tools, topics, variables, messages, connectors, etc.) within an agent workspace quickly with keywords and filters.
- **Usage:** Press the search icon or Ctrl+J/⌘+J and type the desired element; click any result to jump directly to the configuration page.
- **Impact:** Especially useful for complex agents with many components; streamlines updates and navigation.

### 4. Secure Data Labeling and Governance Tools

- **Purview Data Map Connector:** Now generally available for Dataverse, automatically discovers and catalogs Dataverse tables, fields, and relationships, enriching Purview with metadata and lineage.
- **Autolabel for Dataverse (Preview):** Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) labels can be applied directly at the data layer, automatically tagging and classifying PII or sensitive records without manual workflows.
- **Labeled Experiences (Preview):** Copilot Studio can mask or block content marked as sensitive during chats or Microsoft 365 Copilot sessions per MIP rules—preventing data leaks.

## Admin Center Enhancements

### 1. Per-Agent Message Capacity Management in Power Platform Admin Center

- **Control Message Limits:** Assign portions of prepaid message packs to individual agents (by percentage or count) and monitor consumption in real time.
- **Benefits:** Avoid surprise overages, ensure mission-critical agents retain capacity, and customize fallback behaviors for lesser-priority agents.

### 2. Centralized Agent & Connector Management in Microsoft 365 Admin Center

- **Overview:** View all custom and third-party agents in a single dashboard, filter by sensitivity label, metadata, or owner info.
- **Functionality:** Assign MIP labels at agent level, configure connector behavior, export agent inventories, and manage security risk by easily blocking or deleting orphaned or non-compliant agents.
- **AI Recommendations:** Receive optimization suggestions for governance and resource usage.

### 3. Agent Quarantine API

- **New API:** Security teams can programmatically quarantine (block/unblock) Copilot Studio agents—immediately isolating potential threats without manual intervention.
- **Compliance:** Supports incident response and regulatory requirements (ISO, SOC 2, etc.), enabling secure innovation and agent management.

## Analytics Enhancements

### 1. Analytics for ROI and User Feedback

- **ROI Analysis:** Track estimated time and cost savings per agent run or trigger; input organization-specific parameters for automatic calculation of business impact.
- **User Feedback Integration:** Thumbs-up/down reactions paired with user comments allow insight into agent performance and end-user sentiment, helping makers refine workflows and conversational experiences.
