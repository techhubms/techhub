# Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 Launches for GitHub Copilot Chat and CLI

Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 is now rolling out in GitHub Copilot for Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise users. This release brings significant enhancements to coding and real-world agent workflows, thanks to the model’s improved tool orchestration, advanced context editing, and domain-specific intelligence.

## Availability in GitHub Copilot

**Copilot Chat**

- Claude Sonnet 4.5 can be selected in the Copilot Chat model picker.
- Supported across Visual Studio Code (chat, ask, edit, agent mode), github.com, and GitHub Mobile (iOS, Android).

**Copilot CLI**

- Users on Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise plans can access Claude Sonnet 4.5 in the Copilot CLI (v0.0.329 and above).
- To update, run `npm install -g @github/copilot` and use the `/model` command to switch.

## Enabling Access

- Rollout is gradual. Not all users may see the model immediately.
- Enterprise and Business plan admins must enable the Claude Sonnet 4.5 policy in Copilot settings for users to access the model in both Chat and CLI.
- Copilot Free, Pro, and Pro+ users may bring their own Anthropic API key in VS Code by managing models and entering their key when prompted.
