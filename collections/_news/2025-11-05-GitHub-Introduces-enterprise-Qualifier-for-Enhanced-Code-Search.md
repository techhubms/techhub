# GitHub Introduces 'enterprise:' Qualifier for Enhanced Code Search

GitHub has rolled out a new `enterprise:` qualifier in its code search functionality, aimed at simplifying how users search across multiple organizations within a GitHub enterprise. This addition addresses previous challenges where users needed to manually combine several `org:` qualifiers using boolean operators, a time-consuming process especially for enterprises managing hundreds or thousands of organizations.

## How the 'enterprise:' qualifier works

- Add the `enterprise:` qualifier to your GitHub code search queries to automatically include all organizations within your enterprise.
- This streamlines searches that, until now, required complex combinations of multiple `org:` qualifiers.

[See the official documentation for an example.](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax#enterprise-qualifier)

- The new qualifier integrates with existing GitHub code search qualifiers, following their syntax and limitations.
- This functionality is generally available for all GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers.

## Key points

- **Simplifies enterprise-wide code search**: No need to manually list all organizations for broad queries.
- **Subject to existing search limitations**: Behaves as other code search qualifiers do, ensuring consistent usage and expected results.

For more details and examples, consult the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/search-github/github-code-search/understanding-github-code-search-syntax#enterprise-qualifier).
