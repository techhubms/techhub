# Sora 2 Public Preview Now Available in Azure AI Foundry

**Authors:** Steve Sweetman and Naomi Moneypenny

OpenAI’s Sora 2, a powerful multimodal video generation model, is now available in public preview through [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry). This makes it easier than ever for developers and organizations of all sizes to build, prototype, and deliver innovative video-based applications directly from Microsoft’s unified cloud AI platform.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Video Generation**: Advanced world simulation and physics underpin highly realistic output capabilities.
- **Multimodal Inputs**: Generate videos using text, images, or even other videos as prompts.
- **Synchronized Audio**: Automatically generate and synchronize dialogue and audio tracks, with support for multiple languages.
- **Enhanced Creative Control**: Fine-tune camera angles, scene details, and prompt settings for precision outputs.
- **Security and Safety**: Built-in input and output content filtering, plus Microsoft Azure’s enterprise-grade security, compliance, and governance features.
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with business workflows through API access.

## Use Cases

Sora 2 in Azure AI Foundry opens up possibilities for a variety of roles:

- **Marketers**: Rapidly create high-quality video assets for campaigns.
- **Retailers**: Design interactive, personalized content for customer engagement.
- **Creative Directors**: Prototype dynamic scenes and cinematic experiences, leveraging world simulation for concept development.
- **Educators**: Author immersive instructional media and interactive lesson plans for better learner engagement.

## Access, Pricing, and Model Catalog

- **Now in Public Preview**: Sora 2 is available via API through Standard Global in Azure AI Foundry.
- **Pricing**: {{CONTENT}}.10 per second for video generation (720×1280 portrait, 1280×720 landscape).
- **Wide Model Catalog**: Azure AI Foundry also features models like GPT-image-1, Black Forest Lab’s Flux 1.1, Kontext Pro, and more for additional generative capabilities.

For more technical documentation and updates, see the [Azure AI Foundry Models page](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/concepts/models-sold-directly-by-azure?pivots=azure-openai&tabs=global-standard-aoai%2Cstandard-chat-completions%2Cglobal-standard).

## Security, Compliance, and Responsible AI

Microsoft prioritizes responsible and safe AI deployment. Sora 2 benefits from:

- **Input Filtering**: Prompts (text, image, video) are screened for compliance and safe content.
- **Output Filtering**: Video and audio results are analyzed to block restricted content.
- **Privacy Controls**: Organizational and customer data is protected within Azure’s privacy and governance frameworks.

More on Microsoft’s responsible AI principles can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach).

## Getting Started

To begin working with Sora 2 in Azure AI Foundry:

- Visit the [Azure AI Foundry catalog](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/sora-2)
- Review technical requirements, pricing, and deployment types
- Access models via API to integrate video generation into applications

Sora 2 aims to accelerate the creative process for developers, allowing rapid prototyping and ideation for compelling visual storytelling, all secured and managed through Microsoft’s enterprise-ready platform.
