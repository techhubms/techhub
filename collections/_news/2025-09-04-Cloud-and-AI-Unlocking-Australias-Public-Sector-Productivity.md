stclarke examines Mandala's report on how cloud and AI can transform Australia's government sector, highlighting big savings, improved cybersecurity, and modernization opportunities.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Cloud and AI: Unlocking Australia's Public Sector Productivity

Australia has long been recognized for leadership in digital government, but accelerating adoption of cloud infrastructure and AI-enabled platforms is now critical to avoid lagging behind.

A Mandala report, [Unlocking the Productivity Dividend of Digital Government](https://mandalapartners.com/reports/unlocking-the-productivity-dividend-of-digital-government), quantifies the enormous productivity potential from retiring legacy systems and embracing modern cloud and AI solutions:

## The Opportunity: $1.4 Billion in Annual Savings

- Upgrading from legacy IT to cloud could save the Australian Government an average of $1.4 billion each year, with a cumulative $13.5 billion potentially saved over the next decade.
- Cost reductions come from infrastructure, software, and labor, allowing agencies to reinvest resources in higher-value work and modern service delivery.

> *“Accelerating cloud adoption would drive productivity gains that would unlock $1.4 billion every year. These changes would free staff to focus on higher-value work and transform how government delivers services to the public.”*  
> — Tom McMahon, Mandala

Most public sector IT spending remains on legacy, non-cloud systems, which are expensive, difficult to secure, and do not support advanced AI capabilities. Modern cloud solutions enable scalability, cost savings, and support for AI-powered innovation.

## The AI Dividend

- Cloud is foundational for scaling enterprise-grade AI, unlocking both data value and security.
- Mandala estimates up to $5 billion in additional productivity gains from AI tools by 2035.
- The 2024 [Microsoft 365 Copilot trial](https://www.digital.gov.au/initiatives/copilot-trial) showed staff saved time on summarisation and document drafting, leading to improved workflow and re-allocation of time toward higher-value tasks.

## Strengthening Cybersecurity and Boosting Resilience

Modern cloud platforms deliver strong security benefits:

- Automated threat detection and monitoring
- Rapid security patches and updates
- Encryption and threat intelligence sharing

Migrating to cloud could prevent 2.9 million hours of downtime and save $82 million in lost productivity, as well as $178 million in data breach costs over a decade. The report also finds a 14% reduction in IT carbon footprint is possible.

## Barriers to Cloud and AI Adoption

Significant roadblocks exist:

- Procurement and funding systems are built for capital expenditure, not operational subscriptions
- A risk-averse culture slows innovation
- Skill shortages in digital capabilities
- Large agencies with siloed legacy data find migration more challenging

## Recommendations: A Roadmap for Action

1. **Modernise Procurement and Funding:** Move to operational expenditure, streamline vendor evaluation, and adopt milestone-driven funding.
2. **Strengthen Governance and Leadership:** Empower whole-of-government and cross-agency targets, following global models like the UK’s Government Digital Service.
3. **Partner with Industry:** Create partnerships for training, knowledge transfer, and joint project funding, citing NSW’s migration partnership with Microsoft as an example.

> *“Cloud and AI can lift service quality while increasing productivity and cutting red tape. We must act now or be left behind.”*  
> — Bran Black, Business Council of Australia

## Conclusion

The Mandala report urges a coordinated approach to digital government, positioning cloud and AI not just as a technical upgrade but as a strategic driver of national productivity, resilience, and sustainability. Embracing these technologies enables better public services, enhances security, and reduces environmental impact.
