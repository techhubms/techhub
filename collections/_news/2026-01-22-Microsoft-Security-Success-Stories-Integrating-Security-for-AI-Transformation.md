# Microsoft Security Success Stories: Integrating Security for AI Transformation

**Author: Steve Dispensa**

## Overview

Discover how leading organizations are securing their digital modernization and AI transformation by adopting an integrated Microsoft Security platform. Ford, Icertis, and TriNet's stories illustrate the strategic value of embedding security at every layer, leveraging Zero Trust, automation, and AI-powered insights.

## The Need for Proactive Security

As organizations move to digital and AI-first operations, security must be built in from the ground up. Fragmented tools hinder defense and visibility. An integrated platform ensures protection is ubiquitous and supports resilience, agility, and innovation.

## Three Customer Success Stories
