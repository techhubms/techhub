# GitHub Game Off 2025: Theme Announcement — WAVES

**Author:** Lee Reilly

GitHub’s annual Game Off returns for its 13th year in November 2025. The theme this year is **WAVES**, encouraging you to create a game inspired by anything from gravitational, tsunami, or audio waves to digital, emotional, or nostalgic themes.

## Quick Facts

- **Event:** GitHub Game Off 2025

- **Submission deadline:** December 1, 2025, 13:37 PST

## Ideas and Inspiration
