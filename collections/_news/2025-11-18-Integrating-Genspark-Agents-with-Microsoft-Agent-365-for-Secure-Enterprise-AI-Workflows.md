# Integrating Genspark Agents with Microsoft Agent 365 for Secure Enterprise AI Workflows

Mainfunc, a Palo Alto-based AI startup, has launched Genspark Super Agent—a platform allowing users to interact directly with desired business outcomes like slides or spreadsheets using natural language. Moving beyond conventional chatbots, Genspark focuses on intuitive task automation, enabling users to quickly achieve results such as edited videos, generated images, and entire websites through over 80 specialized agents.

## Partnership with Microsoft Agent 365

Announced at Microsoft Ignite, Genspark agents—alongside offerings from Cognition, Glean, Kasisto, n8n and others—are now discoverable and securely deployable within the Microsoft Agent 365 platform. Agent 365 serves as a central control plane, allowing organizations to manage, secure, and monitor both people and agents, leveraging proven enterprise infrastructure.

### Key Features

- **Integration with Microsoft Entra Agent ID**: Ensures that agents have identity management and access controls aligned with organizational policy.
- **Enterprise Security and Governance**: Agents are protected by Microsoft’s Defender, Entra, and Purview solutions, maintaining compliance and mitigating potential data leakage or unauthorized actions.
- **Collaboration in Microsoft 365**: Agents can be added to teams, accessing resources securely and producing deliverables such as presentations and reports within familiar environments (e.g., PowerPoint).

## Practical Use Case

A marketing executive needing to create a multimedia proposal can select a Genspark agent via Agent 365 and securely collaborate within Microsoft 365 apps. The agent can research, draft, and revise materials while logging actions for compliance and review.

## Developer Insight

Genspark’s slide creation tool includes robust PowerPoint export features—built through multiple iterations for seamless integration. While AI agents can automate up to 90% of preliminary work, Mainfunc stresses the critical role of humans in final verification and approval, promoting responsible use of AI in workflows.

## Security and Control

Agent 365 emphasizes oversight by providing logging, policy adherence checks, and integration with Microsoft admin tools—ensuring that agentic innovation happens alongside the necessary controls for enterprise security and compliance.

## Outlook

With only a year in operation, Mainfunc’s collaboration with Microsoft opens new channels to enterprise users, demonstrating the practical impact of secure, managed AI agent workflows for business productivity.
