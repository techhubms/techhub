# Vibe Coding a Podcast Analytics Dashboard with GitHub Copilot and AI

**Author: James Montemagno**

## Overview

James Montemagno demonstrates the power of modern AI-assisted development by building a complete podcast analytics dashboard in minutes using GitHub Copilot and Claude Sonnet 4.5, directly within Visual Studio Code. This case study reveals a practical, outcome-focused approach to "vibe coding," where conversational prompts guide AI in generating both the technical architecture and the code for a full-stack application.

## The Challenge

Starting with a CSV file containing podcast metrics from nearly 500 episodes, James wanted to avoid the traditional, time-consuming process of dashboard development. Instead, he used VS Code, engaged GitHub Copilot's chat powered by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and gave a natural-language prompt describing his outcome:

> “In the attached file is all of our podcast metrics for every episode. Create a beautiful website that helps visualize, search, finds topics, and more. Come up with a bunch of ideas for what a podcast creator would want and build it out. Use a vite based app that I can use and publish on github pages.”

## Solution Choices by AI

The AI immediately picked appropriate technologies and patterns:

- **React + TypeScript** for robust, modern UI development
- **Vite** for fast project setup
- **Tailwind CSS** for easy styling
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Lucide React** for icons
- Clear component structure (Dashboard, Episode List, Topic Analysis, etc.)
- React Hooks for state management
- Utility and type definition modules

## Project Scaffolding Example

```typescript
// Project file structure
├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx // Main app
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Dashboard.tsx
│   │   ├── EpisodeList.tsx
│   │   ├── TopicAnalysis.tsx
│   │   ├── PerformanceCharts.tsx
│   │   └── EpisodeDetail.tsx
│   ├── utils.ts // Parsing helpers
│   └── types.ts // Type definitions
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── tailwind.config.js
```

## Handling Issues and Iteration

- **CSV Parsing Bug:** The original parser failed for titles with commas inside quotes. After James described the bug to Copilot, the AI refactored the parser with correct quote handling.
  
  ```typescript
  const parseCSVLine = (line: string): string[] => {
    const result: string[] = [];
    let current = '';
    let inQuotes = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < line.length; i++) {
      const char = line[i];
      if (char === '"') inQuotes = !inQuotes;
      else if (char === ',' && !inQuotes) { result.push(current.trim()); current = ''; }
      else current += char;
    }
    result.push(current.trim());
    return result;
  };
  ```

- **TypeScript Build Errors:** Unused imports caused deployment failures. Copilot automatically cleaned up imports and adjusted code for best practices.

- **Deployment:** A GitHub Actions workflow was generated by referencing a previous project, automating build and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Key Features Built

- **Dashboard Analytics:** Overall statistics, top episodes, performance timelines
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Customizable with React hooks and memoization for efficiency
- **AI-Powered Topic Extraction:** Recognizes episode topics and clusters analytics by theme
- **Retention Analytics:** Calculates listening curves per episode
- **Interactive Charts:** Responsive, with Recharts component examples

## Development Methodology Insights

- **Outcome-Driven Prompts:** Focused on what’s needed, rather than how to implement
- **AI as Architect and Implementer:** From technology decision-making to code generation
- **Iterative Debugging:** AI handled refactoring and bug fixes
- **Type Safety First:** Leverages TypeScript for reliability

## What Developers Can Learn

- How to leverage AI to skip boilerplate and focus on outcomes
- Using natural language prompts to drive solution design and code generation
- Building, deploying, and refining modern apps using GitHub Copilot as both pair programmer and architect

## Conclusion

James' experience illustrates how AI tools can co-own implementation while developers retain ownership of outcomes and quality—enabling rapid, creative, and highly productive software development workflows.
