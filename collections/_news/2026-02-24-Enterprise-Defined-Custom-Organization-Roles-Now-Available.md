Allison details the new enterprise-defined custom organization roles feature in GitHub Enterprise, making it easier for administrators to standardize and manage access permissions across organizations.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Enterprise-Defined Custom Organization Roles Now Available

Managing role-based access standards across multiple organizations is often complex, particularly in large or decentralized enterprises. GitHub Enterprise Cloud now enables enterprise administrators to create a standardized set of custom organization roles that are accessible across all organizations within an enterprise.

This enhancement allows up to 20 enterprise-defined custom roles to be made available. Core sets of roles used for daily tasks can be standardized, supporting compliance and ensuring a consistent experience as users move between organizations.

**Key Features:**

- **Centralized Role Creation:** Only authorized enterprise administrators can create or edit these roles, ensuring control and oversight.
- **Flexible Assignment:** Organization administrators can assign these roles either via organization settings or through the [organization role assignment API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/rest/orgs/organization-roles#assign-an-organization-role-to-a-team).
- **Unified Permissions:** The same set of organization and repository permissions are used for both enterprise-level and organization-level roles, with no functional difference between them.

**Getting Started:**

- [Learn how to create enterprise-defined custom organization roles](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-roles-in-your-enterprise/create-custom-roles#creating-organization-custom-roles)
- Provide feedback or join discussions in the [GitHub Community Enterprise forum](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/enterprise)

This update streamlines administrative workflows, supports compliance requirements, and creates a more consistent experience for organizations that are part of a larger GitHub Enterprise.
