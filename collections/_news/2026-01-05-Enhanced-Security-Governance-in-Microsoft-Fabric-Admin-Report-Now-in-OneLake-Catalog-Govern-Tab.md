# Enhanced Security Governance in Microsoft Fabric: Admin Report Now in OneLake Catalog Govern Tab

Microsoft Fabric is consolidating and enhancing its security governance experience by moving the powerful reports from the Microsoft Purview Hub to a newly improved Admin Report found in the Govern tab of the OneLake Catalog. This change, announced at Ignite, was designed in response to customer feedback for more unified and actionable data governance tools.

## Key Benefits

- **Unified Governance Command Center**: The new Admin Report is available directly within the OneLake Catalog's Govern tab, making it a single point for monitoring, discovering, and governing data security and compliance.
- **Actionable Context**: Administrators have rapid access to remediation tools. Spotting gaps like missing sensitivity labels or uncertified assets allows for quicker protective action.
- **Simplified Experience**: Fabric Admins benefit from an interface that reinforces stewardship and ensures that no key security or compliance insights are overlooked.

## Insights Provided in the Admin Report

### Sensitivity Label Coverage

- Visualize what percentage of your items (Lakehouses, Warehouses, Reports) are labeled for information protection.
- Identify and remediate unlabeled or high-risk data quickly.
- Drill down into label usage by item type, user, domain, or workspace to resolve discrepancies and improve policy alignment.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP) State

- View which workspaces and items have DLP enabled and actively scanned.
- Easily identify risks of sensitive data exposure by locating items not covered by DLP policies or those in violation.
- Breakdown protection status by item type, workspace, or scan recency for complete oversight.

### Interactive Exploration

- Leverage Copilot to further explore security insights and interact with tenant-level findings.
