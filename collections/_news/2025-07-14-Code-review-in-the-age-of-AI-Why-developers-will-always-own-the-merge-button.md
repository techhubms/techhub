Author Elle Shwer discusses the evolving role of GitHub Copilot in assisting with code merging processes, while emphasizing that ultimate control stays with developers. The article offers insights into how intelligent tools can support but not replace human judgement during critical development workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

## GitHub Copilot's Role in Code Merging

In this article by Elle Shwer, the focus is on the integration of GitHub Copilot into the code merging process. The author highlights a key principle: while AI-powered tools are increasingly capable, the authority and responsibility for merging code remain firmly with human developers.

### Enhancing, Not Replacing, Developer Decisions

Tools like GitHub Copilot are being reimagined not as replacements for developers but as intelligent assistants that can streamline workflows. Their growing capabilities offer suggestions, automate repetitive elements, and provide contextual guidance during code merges. However, these tools are designed to support, not override, the developer's expertise and final judgement.

### The Future of Collaboration

The article encourages developers to view Copilot as an enhancement to collaboration—helping to catch issues early, offer relevant snippets, or resolve merge conflicts more efficiently. By maintaining the developer's authority, teams can benefit from AI assistance while upholding best practices and preserving code quality.

Overall, the piece invites reflection on the evolving interplay between AI-driven tools and the irreplaceable insights of human developers in modern software development.
