# Organization-Level GitHub Copilot Usage Metrics Dashboard Public Preview

GitHub has launched a public preview for a new dashboard that provides organization owners and select admins with direct visibility into Copilot usage metrics at the organization level. Previously, such dashboards were limited to the enterprise level, requiring org admins to depend on broader enterprise reports for insights.

## Key Features

- **Organization-Scoped Metrics:** The dashboard displays Copilot usage statistics specific to an organization, allowing for more granular insights.
- **Accessible in GitHub UI:** Organization owners and custom role users (with `View Organization Copilot Metrics` enabled) can access these metrics directly, provided Copilot usage metrics are enabled at the organization or enterprise level.
- **Supports All Organization Types:** Both enterprise-owned and standalone organizations—including Free and Team—can utilize the new dashboard.

## Benefits

- **Improved Visibility:** Admins can easily track Copilot adoption and ongoing usage trends within their own organizations.
- **Least Privilege Sharing:** Access can be configured to avoid unnecessary enterprise-wide visibility, aligning with access management best practices.
- **Reduced Reliance on Enterprise Reports:** Daily operational insights are available at the organization scope without accessing broader enterprise reports.

## Important Considerations

- **Metrics May Differ from Enterprise Totals:** Users who belong to multiple organizations might have their usage displayed in more than one org report, while enterprise-level reports deduplicate these entries. As such, organization and enterprise totals might not match.

This dashboard enhancement enables organizations to better understand, administer, and adopt GitHub Copilot at a finer organizational scope.
