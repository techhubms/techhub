Mario Rodriguez reports on the public preview of Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI Codex as coding agents in GitHub's Agent HQ, enabling developers to use multiple AI tools (including Copilot) directly within their workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Using Claude and Codex AI Agents in GitHub Agent HQ

**Author:** Mario Rodriguez  

Agent HQ inside GitHub now supports running multiple coding agents, including Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI Codex, in public preview for Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise users. This integration allows developers to interact with several AI-powered assistants directly within GitHub, GitHub Mobile, and Visual Studio Code, reducing the need for external tools and context switching. Support for Copilot CLI is also coming soon.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Multiple AI Coding Agents:** Use and compare GitHub Copilot, Claude by Anthropic, and OpenAI Codex (in public preview) for different development tasks and reviews.
- **Unified Workflow:** All agents operate natively within GitHub environments, keeping context, code history, and reviews attached to your repository—no separate dashboards or workflows required.
- **Parallel Agent Reviews:** Assign multiple agents to the same task to compare their approaches, surface tradeoffs, and pressure-test code for edge cases or architectural risks.
- **Team and Organization Controls:**
  - **Agent Controls:** Centralized access and security policy management for selecting which models and agents are available across organizations.
  - **Code Quality Checks:** GitHub Code Quality (public preview) extends security and maintainability reviews for agent-generated changes.
  - **Automated First-pass Reviews:** Copilot agents can address initial code problems before human review.
  - **Impact Metrics:** Copilot metrics dashboard for tracking AI code contributions and adoption trends.
  - **Audit Logging:** Enterprise-grade logging ensures full visibility and accountability.

## Example Use Cases

- **Architectural Reviews:** Agents evaluate modularity and coupling.
- **Logical Testing:** Agents find edge cases, potential async or scaling failures.
- **Pragmatic Suggestions:** AI proposes the smallest safe refactor to minimize risk.

## Expansion and Roadmap

- **More Agents Coming:** Planned expansions will allow broader access to Claude and Codex for more Copilot subscribers. Work is underway with partners like Google, Cognition, and xAI to add additional specialized agents.
- **Getting Started:** Detailed documentation is available for enabling and managing third-party coding agents in your repository settings.
