# Using Claude and Codex AI Agents in GitHub Agent HQ

**Author:** Mario Rodriguez  

Agent HQ inside GitHub now supports running multiple coding agents, including Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI Codex, in public preview for Copilot Pro+ and Copilot Enterprise users. This integration allows developers to interact with several AI-powered assistants directly within GitHub, GitHub Mobile, and Visual Studio Code, reducing the need for external tools and context switching. Support for Copilot CLI is also coming soon.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Multiple AI Coding Agents:** Use and compare GitHub Copilot, Claude by Anthropic, and OpenAI Codex (in public preview) for different development tasks and reviews.
- **Unified Workflow:** All agents operate natively within GitHub environments, keeping context, code history, and reviews attached to your repository—no separate dashboards or workflows required.
- **Parallel Agent Reviews:** Assign multiple agents to the same task to compare their approaches, surface tradeoffs, and pressure-test code for edge cases or architectural risks.
- **Team and Organization Controls:**
  - **Agent Controls:** Centralized access and security policy management for selecting which models and agents are available across organizations.
  - **Code Quality Checks:** GitHub Code Quality (public preview) extends security and maintainability reviews for agent-generated changes.
  - **Automated First-pass Reviews:** Copilot agents can address initial code problems before human review.
  - **Impact Metrics:** Copilot metrics dashboard for tracking AI code contributions and adoption trends.
  - **Audit Logging:** Enterprise-grade logging ensures full visibility and accountability.

## Example Use Cases

- **Architectural Reviews:** Agents evaluate modularity and coupling.
- **Logical Testing:** Agents find edge cases, potential async or scaling failures.
- **Pragmatic Suggestions:** AI proposes the smallest safe refactor to minimize risk.

## Expansion and Roadmap

- **More Agents Coming:** Planned expansions will allow broader access to Claude and Codex for more Copilot subscribers. Work is underway with partners like Google, Cognition, and xAI to add additional specialized agents.
- **Getting Started:** Detailed documentation is available for enabling and managing third-party coding agents in your repository settings.
