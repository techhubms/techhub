# Microsoft Elevate UAE: Training Over 100,000 Students and Educators in AI Skills

Microsoft is advancing its global skilling initiative, Microsoft Elevate, with a specific focus on the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This effort is part of a broader commitment to prepare the country's next generation for an AI-centric workforce. The initiative aims to provide AI literacy, advanced skills, and credentials, targeting students, educators, and government employees.

## Ambitious Skilling Goals in the UAE

- Microsoft Elevate UAE intends to skill over 250,000 students, faculty, and staff, as well as 55,000 government employees.
- The broader goal aims for one million skilled individuals in the country.
- The company also announced a $15.2 billion USD investment in the UAE to enhance technological infrastructure, talent, and trust.

## Partnerships and Educational Programs

- Microsoft is partnering with the UAE Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and local institutions to embed AI skills in school curricula.
- Collaborations with GEMS (the largest UAE private school provider) are integrating AI skills for 10,000 teachers and 150,000 students, including Copilot workshops and custom AI agents.
- Nonprofit partnerships (e.g., INJAZ UAE) are delivering AI Fundamentals courses and credentialing thousands via the Skills Spot platform.
- Higher education partnerships with MBZUAI, Higher Colleges of Technology, and UAE University aim to foster AI research and advanced skills.

## Government Employee Upskilling

- Specialized courses for government workers are delivered through the JAHIZ platform in partnership with G42.
- Over the next year, 55,000 federal employees will be credentialed in AI.
- Leadership programs developed with INSEAD focus on strategic AI thinking and responsible adoption, with over 1,200 senior leaders already trained.

## Societal and Economic Impact

- These initiatives address the UAE's digital skills gap, with current studies showing over 40% of working-age adults are not yet using AI.
- By scaling AI literacy, the program supports the country's vision for a knowledge-based and innovation-driven economy.

## Conclusion

Microsoft Elevate UAE represents a long-term pledge to empower Emiratis by delivering AI skilling at every level, from classrooms to government offices, supporting both national AI adoption and responsible governance.
