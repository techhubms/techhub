# GPT-5.3-Codex Now Available in GitHub Copilot Chat on Web and IDEs

**Author:** Allison  

GitHub has released GPT-5.3-Codex as a generally available model for users with Copilot Enterprise, Copilot Business, Copilot Pro, and Copilot Pro+ subscriptions. This model can now be accessed within GitHub Copilot Chat across several environments:

- **github.com**
- **GitHub Mobile**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Visual Studio**

## How to Enable Access

For organizations using Copilot Business and Enterprise, administrators must opt in by enabling the GPT-5.3-Codex policy in Copilot settings. Once enabled, organization users will see the new model in the chat model picker in their Copilot Chat interface.

If you do not yet have access to the model, you may need to wait for the rollout to reach your account.
