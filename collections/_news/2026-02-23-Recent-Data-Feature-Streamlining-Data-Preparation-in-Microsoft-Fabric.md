# Recent Data: Get Back to Your Data Faster in Fabric (Preview)

**Author: Microsoft Fabric Blog**

Iterative data preparation can involve frequent reconnection to the same tables, files, or databases. The new **Recent Data** module in Dataflow Gen2 is designed to streamline this process. Instead of navigating repeatedly through connection dialogs or complex folder structures, users now have immediate access to their most often used data items, letting them focus on transformation logic and workflow design.

## What’s New with Recent Data

- **Item-Level Recall**: The module tracks not just data connections but the specific files, tables, folders, databases, and sheets the user accessed, enabling direct loading into a project.
- **Power Query Integration**: Accessible from the Power Query ribbon, users can view a curated list of recently used items for quick selection.
- **Modern Get Data Interface**: Within the Get Data experience, choosing Recent Data exposes history for rapid import into the Dataflow Gen2 editing canvas.
