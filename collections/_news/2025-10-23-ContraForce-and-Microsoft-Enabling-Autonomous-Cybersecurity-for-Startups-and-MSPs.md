# ContraForce and Microsoft: Enabling Autonomous Cybersecurity for Startups and MSPs

In an era of rapidly evolving cyber threats, ContraForce—a Microsoft Pegasus Program startup—is dedicated to making managed service providers (MSPs) the frontline defenders in global cybersecurity. Through deep collaboration with Microsoft's security ecosystem, ContraForce leverages:

- **Microsoft Sentinel** for SIEM capabilities
- **Microsoft Defender XDR** for extended detection and response
- **Microsoft Entra ID** for identity and access management
- **Azure AI Foundry** and the **Microsoft AI Co-Innovation Lab** for creating AI agents and automation

## Redefining Security Operations for MSPs

ContraForce, led by CEO Stan Golubchik, recognized the scaling challenges small service providers face in security operations. By integrating tightly with Microsoft's technology stack, ContraForce provides:

- AI-driven automation to accelerate incident investigation and response (automating up to 90% of tasks)
- Autonomous AI agents, reducing the need for large, highly specialized teams
- A platform allowing service providers to deliver enterprise-grade security with operational efficiency and reduced costs
- Community initiatives like open response playbooks for sharing threat intelligence and best practices

## AI, Automation, and Microsoft Security Integrations

ContraForce uses Azure-hosted AI planning agents to power its platform. Built through collaboration at Microsoft’s AI Co-Innovation Lab and on Azure AI Foundry, these agents:

- Orchestrate autonomous incident response, integrating natively with Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR
- Support scalable managed detection and response (MDR) for thousands of providers
- Enable rapid incident resolution and improved security outcomes

A planned community edition will allow sharing of standardized response playbooks, fostering industry-wide knowledge exchange.

## Microsoft for Startups: Accelerating Growth

Through the Pegasus Program and Microsoft for Startups, ContraForce quickly built connections across the Microsoft partner network, drove enterprise market adoption, and readied itself for launches on the Microsoft Marketplace and Security Store.

## Looking Ahead

ContraForce’s mission is to equip MSPs worldwide—serving businesses of every size—with autonomous security tools tightly integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem. By prioritizing scalable, AI-powered solutions, they help customers become resilient and impactful in the face of relentless cybercrime.

Cybersecurity is increasingly collaborative. Leveraging Microsoft’s technical platforms, ContraForce is building tools and community resources so every service provider can contribute to a safer digital world.
