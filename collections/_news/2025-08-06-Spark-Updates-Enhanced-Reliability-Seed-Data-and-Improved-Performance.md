# Spark Updates: Enhanced Reliability, Seed Data, and Improved Performance

**Author:** Allison

GitHub has released several enhancements to Spark, their app development platform, aimed at improving the user workflow and reducing interruptions during app creation.

## Enhanced Reliability

- Resolved errors that previously prevented agent iterations from saving.
- Fixed initialization failures blocking new agent iterations.
- Optimized handling of multiple tool calls to speed up generations.

These updates are intended to offer developers a smoother experience with fewer workflow interruptions when building apps on Spark.

## Prepopulated Seed Data

When a new Spark app is created, the platform now automatically fills the data store with relevant seed data. This lets developers instantly preview their app's look and function with realistic content, providing a clearer sense of the final product and supporting quicker iteration.

## Additional Improvements

- Users now receive clear notifications if Spark is under high demand, and the platform will automatically fail over to alternate models to ensure uninterrupted building.
- Video assets uploaded to apps now display properly in previews.
- App links are configured to open in new tabs for convenience.
- The repository creation process has been updated with a confirmation dialog, making it easier for users to access newly created repositories.

## Get Started

Developers can try these Spark updates by visiting [github.com/spark](https://github.com/spark) and utilizing the enhanced features to streamline their app development experience.
