# Innovations in Fabric Data Factory Orchestration at Fabric Conference Europe 2025

*By Microsoft Fabric Blog*

The Microsoft Data Integration team unveiled significant enhancements to Fabric Data Factory orchestration during Fabric Conference Europe 2025 in Vienna. These updates aim to empower data engineers, architects, and integration professionals with versatile, user-friendly pipeline and Airflow features to build, orchestrate, and manage data solutions efficiently.

## Key Announcements and Features

### Data Movement Simplified

- **Copy Job Activity**: New pipeline activity simplifying data movement in Fabric Data Factory, supporting full and incremental data loads across cloud environments and complex ETL orchestration.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Advanced performance optimizations and streamlined design-first pipelines ensure reliable data synchronizations.

### Airflow and Notebook Integration

- **Fabric Notebooks in Airflow DAGs**: Users can embed Python code to call Fabric Notebooks within Airflow workflows, enhancing data exploration and transformation directly within orchestration processes.

### Unified Pipeline Terminology

- 'Data pipelines' are now known as 'Pipelines', reflecting an expanded mission to orchestrate data processes, applications, and business workflows from Fabric Data Factory.

### Enhanced Pipeline Activities

- **Invoke Pipeline Activity**: Trigger other pipelines from within a pipeline for modularity and reuse.
- **Integrated Teams and Outlook Activities**: Notify stakeholders or trigger workflows using familiar communication tools.
- **Dataflow Activity**: Integrate code-free data transformations.
- **Fabric Functions**: Run custom code for advanced processing with Fabric Functions and new Function activity.

### DevOps and Automation Support

- **CI/CD for Fabric Airflow Projects**: Native support for continuous integration and deployment streamlines scaling, updating, and managing data workflows with best practice DevOps.
- **Service Principal Name (SPN) Support**: Notebook activities now support SPN for secure authentication.

### Monitoring and Scheduling Improvements

- **Workspace Monitoring**: Pipelines support real-time monitoring for performance and reliability insights.
- **Multiple Schedules**: Assign multiple schedules to a single pipeline for flexible automation.

### Expression Editor and AI-Driven Copilot

- **Pipeline Expression Copilot (Private Preview)**: New in-line AI assistance (Copilot) in the expression editor helps pro developers build pipeline expression code faster using natural language inputs, currently available via private preview.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Test and debug pipeline expressions in real time directly within the design experience.
- **Pipeline Variable Libraries**: Build metadata-driven pipeline patterns and collaborate with ease.

### Community and Mission

The article closes by thanking the Fabric Data Factory community for their feedback and innovation. Microsoft encourages continued exploration of these orchestration features to enhance data integration and automation strategies.
