# Dependabot Security Updates Now Support uv

Dependabot, GitHub's automated security update tool, now features support for the uv package manager. With this improvement, when vulnerabilities are detected in any uv dependencies, Dependabot can:

- Automatically generate security alerts for affected dependencies.
- Open pull requests to update insecure packages to safer versions.
- Integrate with existing GitHub workflows for continuous and secure software development.

## How It Works

- **Security Alerting**: If a vulnerability is found in a project's uv dependency, Dependabot notifies maintainers and contributors.
- **Automated Remediation**: Dependabot creates pull requests proposing safe dependency updates, helping teams reduce risk with less manual effort.

## Why This Matters

Security in the software supply chain is a growing focus area. By expanding support to uv, GitHub is helping developers better automate and manage vulnerability response directly in their DevOps pipelines.
