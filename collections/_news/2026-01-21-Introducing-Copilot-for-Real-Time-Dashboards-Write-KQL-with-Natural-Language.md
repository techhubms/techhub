Microsoft Fabric Blog announces the integration of Copilot into Real-Time Dashboard tile editing, empowering users to generate KQL queries from natural language questions using AI.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Introducing Copilot for Real-Time Dashboards: Write KQL with Natural Language

The latest update brings AI-powered query authoring directly into the Real-Time Dashboard tile editing experience in Microsoft Fabric. With Copilot's new assistant pane, users can:

- **Ask questions in plain English** and have Copilot instantly convert them into Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries.
- **Effortlessly generate working KQL queries**, saving time and enabling both beginners and experts to quickly build insightful, real-time visualizations.
- **Replace or refine tile queries**: Users can use the generated KQL as-is or edit it to suit specific needs.

This advancement lowers the barrier for creating data-driven dashboard visualizations and boosts overall productivity.

**Example usages:**

- *“Show me the top 5 services by error rate in the last 30 minutes.”* produces a ready-to-use KQL query for that insight.
