- Enhanced reasoning and execution for complex, tool-driven, and long-running coding workflows
- Up to 25% faster performance on agentic coding tasks compared to GPT-5.2-Codex

## Availability

GPT-5.3-Codex is being gradually rolled out to:

- Copilot Pro
- Copilot Pro+
- Copilot Business
- Copilot Enterprise

Developers will be able to select this model in:

- Visual Studio Code (all modes: chat, ask, edit, agent)
- github.com
- GitHub Mobile (iOS and Android)
- GitHub CLI

If you do not see the model immediately, check back as the rollout is gradual.
