# Visual Studio AI Roadmap: Copilot Chat, Agents, and Model Integrations (November)

*Author: Rhea Patel*

## Overview

This roadmap shares the upcoming advancements for bringing rich, AI-powered features to Visual Studio, focusing on developer productivity, smarter workflows, and integration of the latest AI models via GitHub Copilot and custom agentic experiences. These improvements are based on ongoing work scheduled for November.

> *Disclaimer: Features discussed are planned and may evolve as feedback is gathered. Upvote the features you find valuable to influence the roadmap.*

## New AI Agents in Visual Studio

- **Custom Agents:** Developers can soon create and manage user-defined custom agents to tailor workflows ([learn more](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Custom-modes-for-Copilot-Chat/10950930?q=custom+modes)).
- **Test Agent:** A new agent to automate and streamline test-related tasks ([details](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-Test-Agent-in-Visual-Studio/10977071)).
- **Debugger Agent:** Improves troubleshooting by integrating advanced debugging workflows ([read more](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-Debugging--Agent-in-Visual-Studi/10951168?)).
- **Multiple Agent Support:** Work is progressing towards supporting multiple agents operating concurrently ([investigation link](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Investigate-being-able-to-run-multiple-V/10992995)).

## Copilot Chat and Agent Mode Enhancements

- **Slash Commands:** Integrates unified and extensible chat commands for invoking prompts and managing conversations ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Slash-Commands-%E2%80%94-Unified-and-Extensible/10992996)).
- **Memories in Chat:** Remembers past interactions and context to improve chat quality ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Memories-Improvements-in-Chat/10993002)).
- **Dynamic Tool Calling:** Allows chat to call various tools dynamically in the workflow ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Dynamic-tool-calling-in-Chat/10975291)).
- **Thread Summarization:** Summarizing thread history for seamless chat continuation ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Summarize-thread-history-when-limits-are/10975263)).
- **Planning Enhancements:** Read-only modes for planning and improved inline previews in chat ([references](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Make-Planning-in-Chat-Read-Only/10993007), [inline preview](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Improve-Planning-UX-Inline-Preview-in-C/10993009)).

## Advancing Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **Development Stack Integration:** MCP is evolving to enable integration of an entire development stack within Visual Studio, prioritizing governance, security, and usability.
- **Sampling Window UX:** Improved in-chat experience for sampling window management ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Move-MCP-Sampling-Window-to-In-chat-expe/10993000)).
- **Performance Optimizations:** Ongoing improvements to token usage and server performance ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Performance-and-token-usage-optimization/10993001)).
- **Governance:** Enhanced governance features to support enterprise needs ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-enables-governance-to-supp/10951779?sort=relevance&amp;scope=follow)).
- **Unified UX:** Toward a more streamlined MCP unified experience ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/MCP-Unified-UX-Experience/10975289?sort=relevance&amp;scope=follow)).

## Model Integration and Management

- **Latest Models:** Integration of advanced models such as GPT-5 Codex and dynamic auto model selection for improved coding assistance ([GPT-5 Codex discussion](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Add-GPT-5-Codex-in-Copilot-Chat/10975261)).
- **Model UX Enhancements:** Improved management experience for soon-to-be deprecated models ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Improve-Model-UX-for-Soon-to-be-Deprecat/10992997)), and differentiated system prompts per model ([reference](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Different-System-prompts-per-model/10992999)).

## Impact for Developers

These updates expand Visual Studio’s AI capabilities beyond just code generation. Copilot and its agent ecosystem will help with code search, debugging, unit test writing, error detection, and code management—deeply integrated into the daily development workflow.

## Feedback and Community Involvement

Microsoft actively solicits community feedback via linked developer community tickets. Developers are encouraged to upvote proposals and submit their suggestions as the roadmap continues to evolve.
