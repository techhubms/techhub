# Securing Sensitive Mobile Operations with Device-Bound Request Signing

*By Fernando de Oliveira, Daiane Galvão, Wesley Rodrigues*

Modern mobile apps are often a gateway to highly sensitive services—financial transactions, healthcare, government, and enterprise workflows. While conventional authentication (OAuth, MFA) confirms user identity, it cannot always guarantee that a request is coming from an enrolled, untampered device. Attackers can replay stolen tokens from emulators or cloned environments, creating a critical gap in mobile security.

## The Case for Device-Bound Request Signing (DBRS)

DBRS introduces cryptographic signatures generated by hardware-based keys established during secure enrollment. Every API request is signed by the unique private key, ensuring requests are both user- and device-authenticated. Backend services validate these signatures using a device registry, cryptographically assuring that only the original device can make authenticated requests—even if credentials are stolen.

### Key Mechanisms

- **Hardware-backed key generation:** On first-time enrollment or after app reinstall, devices generate non-exportable keys (e.g. iOS Secure Enclave, Android Keystore), binding user and device identity.
- **Proof of possession:** Each API call is signed with the hardware-backed private key, ensuring origin authenticity.
- **Backend verification:** Public keys are retrieved from a registry, and each signature is checked to confirm the device and user match the registered, enrolled pair.

## Addressing Traditional Authentication Gaps

While mTLS, TLS pinning, and payload encryption protect transport, they don't prove the requesting device's integrity. Newer standards such as DPoP and device-bound session tokens enable sender-constrained credentials but require secure device onboarding and long-term key protection.

## Threat Model: STRIDE Analysis

A detailed STRIDE table outlines how DBRS mitigates spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege, while also listing gaps and complementary controls—such as step-up authentication for enrollment, risk-based policies, continuous attestation, and runtime protection (
RASP).

## Securing Device Enrollment

Because initial trust establishment is the weakest link, best practices include:

- **Step-up authentication:** Require extra verification for device enrollment, like biometrics or push confirmations.
- **Key attestation:** Use platform APIs (iOS DeviceCheck, Android Key Attestation) to ensure keys are hardware-generated.
- **Device risk checks:** Enforce OS/binary integrity, root/jailbreak detection, risk scoring, and manual review for suspicious enrollments.
- **User notifications:** Alert users about new device enrollments, enabling rapid revocation.
- **Approval workflows:** For high-value operations, require administrator sign-off or probationary activation.

## Design and Operational Considerations

- **Algorithm selection:** ECDSA (ES256) and Ed25519 offer fast, secure, and hardware-accelerated signatures. RSA may be required for compatibility. Prepare to evaluate post-quantum options (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, FN-DSA).
- **Compatibility:** Support for hardware-backed key storage varies by platform/version; provide software fallbacks with additional risk controls where necessary.
- **Performance:** Expect minimal latency and increased battery drain on older hardware. Optimize backend caching and monitor registry reliability to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Observability:** Track signing errors, anomaly detection, and audit logs for investigations.

## Tradeoffs and Limitations

Implementing DBRS increases development and operational complexity, may impact performance, and does not solve all mobile security challenges (e.g., pre-enrollment compromise, runtime malware, malicious device owners). DBRS should be layered with least privilege, anomaly detection, and secure development practices.

## Reference Implementation

A practical [device-bound signing sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/device-bound-signing-mobile) is available on GitHub, demonstrating secure enrollment, signatures, and post-quantum algorithm integration.

## Conclusion

Device-Bound Request Signing offers robust, device-centric assurance for high-value mobile operations, aligning with zero-trust ambitions. When combined with behavioral analytics, continuous authentication, and layered security controls, DBRS becomes a cornerstone of resilient, modern app architectures.
