# Developer Workflows in 2025: Insights from 986 Million Code Pushes

**Author:** Cassidy Williams

The software development landscape has fundamentally shifted, with data from the 2025 Octoverse report showing that nearly a billion commits were pushed last year. This remarkable level of activity reflects broader changes in how developers build, review, and ship code.

## Key Changes in Developer Workflows

### 1. Speed and Iteration

- **Frequent, Lightweight Commits:** Developers are moving away from infrequent, large releases. Smaller, continuous code updates have become the new normal. This approach reduces the risk and overhead associated with large pull requests.
- **Continuous iteration** is now expected, making 'done' a temporary state.

### 2. Shipping Practices

- **Widespread Use of Feature Flags:** Feature flags, once rare or only for A/B testing, are now a standard part of deployment. Teams deploy incomplete features safely, controlling exposure in production.
- **CI/CD Automation:** Every commit triggers automated pipelines—including tests, builds, artifact generation, and security scans. Manual deployments are becoming rare as developers rely on these automatic processes to maintain speed and reliability.
- **Short, Focused Pull Requests:** Smaller, purpose-driven pull requests are faster to review and integrate, helping teams keep up with increased code velocity.
- **Testing at Scale:** Developers clocked 11.5 billion GitHub Actions minutes running various types of tests last year, reinforcing how automated testing underpins this new pace.

### 3. Team Communication Evolution

- **Async Standups & Status Updates in Issues:** Communication evolves in step with faster development. Updates move to written records within issues rather than meetings, and teams prioritize hiring people who can ship code quickly and communicate well.
- **Reduced Review Blockers:** Waiting on pull request reviews is decreasingly acceptable, speeding up the release process.

### 4. The Role of Tools and AI

- Although the article notes some "AI fatigue," it predicts the enduring adoption of tools (like Copilot CLI and markdown-to-code workflows) that genuinely enhance productivity.

### 5. What’s Next?

- The future may see even closer integration between specs and code, more collaborative documentation, and deeper automation in everyday developer work. The only constant is change.

## Data-Driven Observations

- **230+ repositories created per minute** and **986 million code pushes** in the past year.
- Significant growth in automated testing and collaborative work practices.
