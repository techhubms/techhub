# Enterprise Metrics for GitHub Copilot CLI Now Available

Copilot enterprise usage metrics have expanded to include Copilot CLI telemetry. This enhancement provides organizations with deeper insights into how Copilot is being used across their developer base via the command line.

## New CLI-Specific Metrics Include

- **Daily active CLI users**: Track which developers are actively using the Copilot CLI.
- **CLI request and session counts**: View the volume of commands and sessions initiated through the CLI.
- **Token usage totals**: Analyze average tokens per request, helping teams understand the scale and intensity of use.

## Why This Matters

- **Adoption Tracking**: Allows organizations to assess Copilot CLI penetration and identify areas where further enablement or support might be required.
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Enables comparison of Copilot usage across different environments and teams.
- **Resource Planning**: Token consumption metrics provide data to help project growth and inform rollout strategies.
