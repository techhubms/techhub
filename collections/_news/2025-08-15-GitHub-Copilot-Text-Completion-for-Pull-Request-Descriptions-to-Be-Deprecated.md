# GitHub Copilot Text Completion for Pull Request Descriptions to Be Deprecated

**Author:** Allison

On September 12, 2025, GitHub Copilot will retire its text completion feature for pull request (PR) descriptions. This currently-in-beta feature, which provided contextual text suggestions for PR descriptions—particularly for Copilot Enterprise customers—will no longer be available after the retirement date.

GitHub cites the decision as a shift in focus: rather than investing further in this specific text completion experience, development will center on new pull request summary improvements. These updates aim to provide developers with more meaningful assistance, resulting in clearer, more accurate, and higher-quality summaries for PRs. The goal is to help reviewers quickly grasp the scope and intent of each pull request, streamlining the code review process.

- **Retirement Date:** September 12, 2025
- **Feature Impacted:** Copilot text completion for PR descriptions (beta)
- **Reason:** Shift in focus towards enhancing pull request summaries
- **Intended Benefit:** Improved assistance in describing changes and assisting reviewers

For further discussion, developers are invited to join the conversation in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/pull-requests). Documentation on pull requests is available [here](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests).
