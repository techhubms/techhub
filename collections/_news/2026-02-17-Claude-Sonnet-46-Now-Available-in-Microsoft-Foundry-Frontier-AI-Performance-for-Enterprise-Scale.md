# Claude Sonnet 4.6 in Microsoft Foundry: Frontier Performance for Scale

**Author:** Amar Badal  
**Published:** Updated Feb 17, 2026  

Claude Sonnet 4.6 is now live in Microsoft Foundry, purpose-built for engineering teams and enterprises seeking powerful AI performance for coding, agentic workflows, and professional knowledge work at scale.

## Key Features

- **Nearly Opus-Level Performance:** Builds on the strengths of Claude Opus 4.6, providing frontier-level reasoning and decision-making at more accessible pricing.
- **Massive Context Window:** 1 million token context window (beta) and 128K output enable operation across large codebases, financial models, multi-document analysis, and complex workflows with minimal fragmentation.
- **Adaptive Thinking & Effort Controls:** New parameters allow Claude to allocate reasoning adaptively, optimizing performance and quality. Teams can tune trade-offs between latency, cost, and quality.

## AI for Developers and Teams

Claude Sonnet 4.6 is designed as an everyday AI model for developers. Its upgrades include:

- Improved reasoning across complex code contexts
- Consistent performance throughout iterative development cycles
- Maintains architectural context as engineers build, refactor, and debug
- Fewer context resets and faster cycle times for agile teams

*Example Use Cases:*

- Building new features
- Refactoring existing modules
- Debugging and quality assurance
- Orchestrating agentic and multi-model pipelines

## Knowledge Work Enablement

- Enhanced search, summarization, and content generation
- Drafting business reports and polished presentations
- Summarizing multi-document sets
- Streamlining iterative editing for production-ready documents

## Advanced Browser Automation

- Achieves high precision on UI tasks (e.g., OSWorld Verified 72.5%)
- Enables browser-based automation without API key dependency
- Navigates and completes workflows across legacy and modern browser environments
- Can execute end-to-end business tasks across surfaces (calendar, messaging, events)

## Enterprise-Grade Deployment

- Deployable entirely within Microsoft Foundry for robust governance, compliance, and operational tooling
- Fits modern workflows from developer tools to enterprise automation agents
