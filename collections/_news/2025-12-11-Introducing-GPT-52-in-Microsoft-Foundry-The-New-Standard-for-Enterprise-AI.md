# Introducing GPT-5.2 in Microsoft Foundry: The New Standard for Enterprise AI

**By Naomi Moneypenny**

Discover GPT-5.2 in Microsoft Foundry—the next standard for enterprise AI on Azure. This release focuses on delivering advanced reasoning, agentic execution, and compliance-ready features, empowering both developers and technical leaders with next-generation AI tools.

## Why Enterprise AI Needs More Than Chat

Modern enterprise applications demand more than simple conversational AI. They require:

- Reliable, reasoning partners that can tackle ambiguous, high-stakes problems
- Multi-agent workflow planning
- Auditable code and solution artifacts

## GPT-5.2: Features and Improvements

- **Deeper Logical Chains**: Enables breakdown of complex tasks and clear justifications, leading to better, explainable outputs for developers
- **Agentic Execution**: Automates the design, implementation, testing, and deployment workflow, reducing manual effort
- **Enhanced Context Handling**: Accepts larger inputs (e.g., project briefs, codebases) for richer and more actionable results
- **Structured Outputs**: Generates design docs, runnable code, unit tests, and even deployment scripts in fewer iterations
- **Safety, Security & Compliance**: Features managed identities, policy enforcement, and enterprise-grade controls for robust governance
- **Performance**: Built on an upgraded architecture, leveraging GPT-5.1 dataset enhancements for improved efficiency and safety

## GPT-5.2 Model Variants

- **GPT-5.2**: Emphasizes advanced reasoning, effective for information work and polished communication outputs, including spreadsheets and presentation formatting
- **GPT-5.2-Chat**: Optimized for technical writing, walkthroughs, info-seeking questions, and educational support

## Use Cases for Developers and Technical Leaders

- **Analytics & Decision Support**: Explains trade-offs, provides wind tunneling for defensible decision making
- **Application Modernization**: Assists in service refactoring, automated test generation, migration planning
- **Data & Pipelines**: Audits ETL, recommends monitoring and SLAs, auto-generates data validation SQL
- **Customer Experience**: Builds robust, context-aware assistants and multi-agent workflows

## Deployment and Pricing

GPT-5.2 can be deployed globally or in regional data zones via Microsoft Foundry on Azure. Pricing varies by deployment type, with published USD rates for input, cached input, and output tokens. See the [Microsoft Foundry page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/) for full details.
