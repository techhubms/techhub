# GitHub Actions Pricing Update for 2026

GitHub has announced significant pricing and platform updates for GitHub Actions, effective January 1, 2026:

## Key Pricing Changes

- **GitHub-hosted runners**: Prices reduced by up to 39%, depending on machine type. Free usage minute quotas remain unchanged ([details](https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing)).
- **Self-hosted runners**: Starting March 1, 2026, a new {{CONTENT}}.002 per minute cloud platform charge will apply for self-hosted runner usage. This charge will count toward the minutes included in each plan ([billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions#free-use-of-github-actions)).
- **Public repositories**: Runner usage stays free.
- **GitHub Enterprise Server**: No changes announced to pricing structure for these customers.

## Product Investments for Developers

GitHub is increasing investment into the Actions self-hosted experience, aiming to provide:

- Enhanced autoscaling

- Expanded platform and Windows support

Developers can expect expanded scaling options and broader OS support in the coming year.
