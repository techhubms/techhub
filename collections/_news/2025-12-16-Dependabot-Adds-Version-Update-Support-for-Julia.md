# Dependabot Adds Version Update Support for Julia

Dependabot, GitHub’s automated dependency update service, now offers support for version updates in projects using Julia as a package manager. This allows developers working with Julia to automate the process of keeping their project dependencies updated, reducing manual effort and increasing project security.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Updates**: Dependabot regularly checks for new versions of Julia dependencies and opens pull requests to keep dependencies up to date.
- **Julia Package Manager Integration**: Works seamlessly for projects using Julia’s package manager, enhancing automation for the Julia ecosystem.

## Community and Documentation

- [Discuss Julia support with the Dependabot open source community](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/2105)
- [Dependabot version updates documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/about-dependabot-version-updates)
- [Learn more about Julia](https://julialang.org/)

Adopting this new feature can help projects mitigate supply chain risks and ensure dependencies are consistently maintained.
