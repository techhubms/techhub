**Author**: Katie Savage

Visual Studio 17.14 Preview 3 introduces several new features and improvements for GitHub Copilot, enhancing the experience of AI-assisted development within Visual Studio. Below are the key updates in this release.

### What's New in Visual Studio 17.14 Preview 3

  - Visual Studio Preview versions allow developers to try experimental features alongside their current setup. [Download Visual Studio Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).

### Guided Walkthrough for Getting Started

If you're new to GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio, the new guided walkthrough streamlines the onboarding process:

- Access the walkthrough from the GitHub Copilot badge dropdown by selecting **GitHub Copilot Walkthrough**.
- The walkthrough opens in a new tab in the workspace and covers five steps:
  1. How to get Copilot for free
  2. Introduction to AI-powered code completions
  3. Using Copilot Chat
  4. Providing Copilot with specific project context
  5. Leveraging Copilot Edits' multi-file editing

After completing the steps, users are ready to start and experiment with Copilot's features. [Video demonstration](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/WalkthroughP3.mp4).

### Improved Model Access and Code Mapping
