Allison presents the new GitHub feature that enables developers to resolve merge conflicts with a single click in the web interface, mirroring the experience of desktop code editors.<!--excerpt_end-->

# One-Click Merge Conflict Resolution in GitHub Web Interface

GitHub has added a much-requested feature to its web interface, enabling developers to resolve merge conflicts in pull requests directly from the browser with a single click. This improvement streamlines code collaboration and reduces the need for external tools or switching to local environments.

## New Merge Conflict Buttons

When a pull request on github.com contains merge conflicts that are eligible for web-based resolution, you’ll now see new options:

- **Accept current changes**: Keeps changes from your branch.
- **Accept incoming changes**: Uses changes from the base branch.
- **Accept both changes**: Combines both sets of changes in the affected file.

These controls are inspired by features in popular code editors like Visual Studio Code, providing a familiar workflow for developers.

## How It Works

- When a pull request has conflicts, conflict markers and the new resolution buttons appear in the web editor.
- Simply click the desired action to resolve each conflict—no need to switch between browser and IDE.
- Once conflicts are resolved, you can continue your workflow as usual.

## Community Feedback

This feature continues to evolve. If you have feedback or encounter issues, participate in the [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/175270).

## Summary

The enhanced merge conflict resolution in the GitHub web interface brings greater convenience and productivity to collaborative development, saving time and aligning pull request workflows more closely with desktop editing experiences.
