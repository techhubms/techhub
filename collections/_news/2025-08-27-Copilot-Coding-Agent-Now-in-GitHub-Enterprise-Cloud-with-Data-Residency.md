# Copilot Coding Agent Now Available in GitHub Enterprise Cloud with Data Residency

The GitHub Copilot coding agent, an autonomous developer assistant, is now available in GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency support. This public preview feature enables organizations to benefit from enterprise-grade AI automation within their GitHub infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Task Delegation**: Assign issues directly to Copilot or use the new [agents panel](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/agents-panel-launch-copilot-coding-agent-tasks-anywhere-on-github/) accessible on every GitHub page to delegate development tasks.

- **Automated Pull Requests**: Copilot works in the background, implements assigned tasks, opens a pull request, and notifies the project owner for review upon completion.

- **Data Residency Support**: Enterprises can leverage Copilot while satisfying data residency requirements, aligning automation with governance standards.

- **Enterprise Subscriptions Required**: A Copilot Business or Enterprise subscription is mandatory, and functionality must be enabled by an administrator. Detailed setup steps are available in the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/enabling-copilot-coding-agent).
