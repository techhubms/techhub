Meera Haridasa introduces VS Code for the Web – Azure and highlights how developers can build, edit, and deploy cloud applications rapidly with pre-integrated runtimes, AI-assisted tools, and direct GitHub and Azure connections.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Accelerate Development with VS Code for the Web – Azure Integration

VS Code for the Web – Azure dramatically streamlines your development workflow, allowing you to code, test, and deploy Azure applications entirely from your browser. This environment is designed to eliminate setup overhead, letting developers focus on building features from day one.

## Key Features

- **Browser-Based Workspace:** Launch a pre-configured coding environment at [vscode.dev/azure](https://vscode.dev/azure)
- **Integrated Runtimes:** Node.js, Python, Java, C#, and Git are available right away
- **Azure Developer CLI (azd):** Simplifies Azure resource management
- **GitHub Integration:** Open, edit, and commit changes to any repository without leaving your browser
- **Smooth Transition:** Move from browser workspace to desktop VS Code with the "Continue on Desktop" feature

## Fast Entry Points for Developers

### Start from Microsoft Foundry

- Access AI-generated code agents on the [Microsoft Foundry site](https://ai.azure.com)
- Instantly open and edit code snippets in VS Code for the Web – Azure using the "Open in VS Code" option
- Refine, test, and deploy Foundry agents without manual setup

### Start from Azure Copilot in the Azure Portal

- In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), use Azure Copilot to generate code for your scenario
- Open generated code directly in VS Code for the Web – Azure with one click
- Leverage GitHub Copilot within the editor for additional code suggestions and improvements
- Iterate and expand your implementation, then deploy with integrated Azure tools

## Seamless AI-to-Cloud Workflows

By connecting AI-powered code generation with browser-based development and cloud deployment, these integrations remove friction at every stage. Developers can:

- Start coding with AI guidance from Foundry or Azure Copilot
- Transition immediately to a ready-to-use browser environment
- Apply iterative updates using GitHub Copilot
- Deploy directly to Azure cloud resources

## Getting Started

Visit [vscode.dev/azure](https://vscode.dev/azure) to experience VS Code for the Web – Azure. Explore new entry points via Foundry and Azure Copilot to optimize your workflow. With ongoing platform improvements, developing cloud applications is faster and more accessible than ever.
