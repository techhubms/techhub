Microsoft Defender Security Research Team presents a technical walkthrough of a multi-stage attack exploiting SolarWinds Web Help Desk, with actionable defensive guidance and hunting tips.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Analysis of Active Exploitation of SolarWinds Web Help Desk: Detection and Mitigation

## Overview

The Microsoft Defender Research Team has observed a multi-stage intrusion campaign in which threat actors exploited internet-exposed instances of SolarWinds Web Help Desk (WHD). The attacks leveraged both old and recently disclosed vulnerabilities (including CVE-2025-40551, CVE-2025-40536, and CVE-2025-26399), enabling unauthenticated remote code execution and subsequent lateral movement within affected organizations. Due to overlapping vulnerable states, the precise initial entry point remains unconfirmed.

## Attack Details

- **Entry Point**: Exploitation of public-facing, vulnerable SolarWinds WHD servers potentially using unpatched CVEs.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Living-off-the-land tactics, abusing legitimate admin tools for low-noise persistence
  - Use of PowerShell and BITS to download and execute payloads
  - Deployment of Zoho ManageEngine tools for remote interactive control
  - Reverse SSH/RDP access to maintain persistence
  - Scheduled task creation to boot QEMU virtual machines for attack concealment
  - DLL sideloading (e.g., abusing wab.exe to load malicious sspicli.dll) for credential theft
  - LSASS access and DCSync to escalate privileges and harvest credentials

## Key Observations

- Attackers chained multiple techniques to evade typical detection methods.
- Malicious activity included domain enumeration, credential theft, and lateral movement to high-value assets.
- Microsoft Defender products provided both pre- and post-breach detection coverage throughout the intrusion.

## Mitigation and Guidance

- **Patch Immediately**: Update SolarWinds WHD to mitigate all referenced CVEs.
- **Restrict Exposure**: Remove public access to admin interfaces, and enable extensive logging.
- **Evict Unauthorized RMM**: Scan for and remove unauthorized ManageEngine installations and related artifacts.
- **Credential Hygiene**: Rotate all compromised credentials, prioritizing service/admin accounts accessible from WHD hosts.
- **Isolation**: Quarantine affected systems to halt further lateral movement.

## Microsoft Defender XDR Detection and Hunting

Microsoft Defender solutions offer comprehensive detection and alerting for attack activities, including exploitation attempts, suspicious PowerShell usage, credential access, and lateral movement via SSH or RDP.

### Example KQL Queries

**Detect post-exploitation command execution:**

```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents
| where InitiatingProcessParentFileName endswith "wrapper.exe"
| where InitiatingProcessFolderPath has "\\WebHelpDesk\\bin\\"
| where InitiatingProcessFileName in~ ("java.exe", "javaw.exe") or InitiatingProcessFileName contains "tomcat"
| where FileName !in ("java.exe", "pg_dump.exe", "reg.exe", "conhost.exe", "WerFault.exe")
```

**Identify potential ntds.dit theft:**

```kusto
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName =~ "print.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine has_all ("print", "/D:", @"\windows\ntds\ntds.dit")
```

**Surface vulnerable WHD servers:**

```kusto
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| where CveId has_any ('CVE-2025-40551', 'CVE-2025-40536', 'CVE-2025-26399')
```
