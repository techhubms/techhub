# Securing the AI Software Supply Chain: Security Results Across 67 Open Source Projects

*By Gregg Cochran*

Modern software systems—including AI, mobile, cloud, and embedded workloads—rely heavily on open source components. From CI pipelines to scientific computing libraries and security frameworks, these elements form the backbone of secure software delivery. This post recounts how the [GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.com/open-source/github-secure-open-source-fund) supported 67 critical projects to accelerate vulnerability fixes and advance ecosystem resilience.

## Why Securing Critical Open Source Projects Matters

A single production service often depends on hundreds or thousands of transitive dependencies. As demonstrated by incidents like [Log4Shell](https://github.blog/open-source/inside-the-breach-that-broke-the-internet-the-untold-story-of-log4shell/), securing upstream components helps reduce systemic risk throughout the software supply chain. Investment in open source security:

- Reinforces that security is a baseline requirement, not optional
- Provides maintainers with resources and support for proactive security
- Reduces risk and strengthens reliability for the community

## The Impact: Session 3 by the Numbers

- **67** projects improved
- **98** maintainers involved
- **$670,000** in non-dilutive funding distributed
- **99%** of projects concluded with GitHub security features enabled

**Across all sessions so far:**

- **138** projects
- **191** new CVEs issued
- **600+** discovered secrets resolved
- **500+** CodeQL alerts fixed in just 6 months

## Where Security Work Happened

### Core Languages and Runtimes

Improvements to CPython, Node.js, LLVM, Rustls, and others benefit entire developer ecosystems by hardening foundational infrastructure.

### Web, Networking, and Infrastructure Libraries

Open source libraries such as curl, urllib3, Netty, Apache APISIX, and quic-go enhanced their security practices, protecting millions of downstream applications.

### Build Systems and CI/CD Tooling

Projects such as Jenkins, Apache Airflow, PyPI Warehouse, and webpack improved their workflows, reducing opportunities for supply chain compromise during software builds and releases.

### Data Science, Scientific Computing, and AI Foundations

Major libraries such as pandas, SciPy, PyMC, and ArviZ invested in security coverage, supporting researchers and production AI systems alike.

### Developer Tools and Utilities

Developer-facing projects (e.g., Selenium, Sphinx, ImageMagick, calibre) worked on risk reduction for day-to-day development processes, lowering the attack surface.

### Identity, Secrets, and Security Frameworks

Projects like Keycloak, external-secrets, oauth2 libraries, and WebAuthn improved their approaches to threat modeling and long-term security.

## Security as Shared Infrastructure

The program fostered a culture shift—security became a core requirement for maintainers, creating reusable playbooks and processes to help the broader community benefit from shared expertise.

## Joining the Mission

The post encourages:

- Maintainers to [apply to the GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.com/open-source/github-secure-open-source-fund)
- Ecosystem partners to [support a safer open source future](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR72dY7PBsFZJkFTETCg9J0xUOEVXVzFKUjk1M0ZaWFVZSTdZMU85MkRPSi4u&route=shorturl)

### Acknowledgements

Thanks are extended to an array of funding and ecosystem partners—including Microsoft and Microsoft for Startups—for making these improvements possible.
