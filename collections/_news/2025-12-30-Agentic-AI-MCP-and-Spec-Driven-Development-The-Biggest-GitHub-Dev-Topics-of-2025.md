# Agentic AI, MCP, and Spec-Driven Development: The Biggest GitHub Dev Topics of 2025

## Overview

Natalie Guevara, editor of The GitHub Blog, recaps the top technical trends and posts from 2025. This summary highlights advances in AI-enabled coding, tool interoperability, spec-driven workflows, and key software engineering stories.

## Key Topics and Announcements

### Agent Mode

- **GitHub Copilot agent mode** (announced February 2025) allows Copilot to autonomously iterate on code, fix errors, and respond to intent in real time within your IDE.
- [Agent Mode 101 guide](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/agent-mode-101-all-about-github-copilots-powerful-mode/) provides steps to use this feature and outlines common use cases.

### Coding Agent

- Launched in May, the **GitHub Copilot coding agent** can handle repository exploration, code writing, test execution, and opening pull requests. It acts when users assign GitHub issues to Copilot or provide prompts in VS Code.

### Agent HQ

- Introduced at GitHub Universe in October, **Agent HQ** is an ecosystem hub for coordinating multiple coding agents—including those from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, and xAI—directly within GitHub through Copilot subscriptions.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **MCP** simplifies interoperability between AI agents and developer tools. Examples include using Playwright for browser automation and Notion for knowledge management.
- In April, Agent Mode with MCP support became available in VS Code.
- The [GitHub MCP Registry](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/meet-the-github-mcp-registry-the-fastest-way-to-discover-mcp-servers/) launched in September, easing discovery and integration of MCP servers.

### Spec-Driven Development

- Emphasizes writing specifications before code and documentation. **Spec Kit**, GitHub's open-source toolkit, enables spec-driven workflows and integrates with coding agents to keep specifications as the process centerpiece.

## Additional Notable Stories

- **Git’s 20th anniversary:** An interview with Linus Torvalds.
- **Security:** A deep-dive into Log4Shell and open-source software security with Christian Grobmeier.
- **Open Source Projects:** Home Assistant's development journey with insights from maintainer Franck Nijhof.

## Conclusion
