# How AI is Reshaping Developer Choice: Insights from Octoverse 2025

*By Andrea Griffiths*

AI-powered tools are dramatically influencing developer preferences and technology trends. Drawing on new statistics from Octoverse 2025, this article examines how convenience loops formed by AI are making 'AI compatibility' a primary criterion for selecting languages and frameworks.

## Octoverse 2025: The Data Behind the Shift

- **TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript to become the most-used language on GitHub for the first time.**
- AI exposure is massive: *80%* of new developers on GitHub use Copilot within their first week.
- AI-driven convenience loops are reshaping not just how fast developers code, but what tools, languages, and frameworks they choose.
- Shell scripting usage in AI-generated projects grew *206%* in one year, largely due to AI absorbing former pain points.

> *"Developer choice is shifting toward technologies that work best with the tools we’re already using."*

## Technical Underpinnings: Why AI Favors Strongly Typed Languages

- AI generates more reliable and context-aware code when using strongly typed languages like TypeScript.
- Constraints from type systems help AI avoid errors and produce code that fits project structures more precisely.
- Over 1.1 million public repositories now use LLM SDKs, marking mainstream adoption of generative AI tools.

## Guidance for Teams and Developers

**For developers:**

- *Establish patterns before generating code*: Copilot follows your examples—strong patterns lead to scalable, maintainable code.
- *Use type systems as guardrails but not crutches*: Relying solely on types can mask business logic errors.
- *Thoroughly test AI-generated code*: Don’t trust it just because it’s quick and passes type checks.

**For engineering leaders:**

- *Prepare for higher velocity*: Throughput can increase 20–30% with AI, but guardrails (architectural standards, patterns, reviews) are essential to prevent accumulating technical debt.
- *Standardize before scaling*: Document workflow patterns, templates, and decisions early—AI tools will amplify whatever structures already exist.
- *Leverage new metrics*: The Copilot usage metrics dashboard enables organizations to track adoption, code quality, agent usage, and language/model correlations to outcomes.
- *Invest in architectural review*, ensuring that increased code velocity does not degrade system coherence.

## Actionable Next Steps

- Reflect on how often AI tooling influences your technology decisions—it likely has more sway than you notice.
- Prioritize AI compatibility when evaluating new technologies or starting new projects.
- Use organization-wide metrics to adjust review and training processes based on real usage data.

**Pro tip:** Check out the [Octoverse 2025 report](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-a-new-developer-joins-github-every-second-as-ai-leads-typescript-to-1/?utm_source=octoverse-cli-cta&utm_medium=octoverse&utm_campaign=universe25post) for more insights on how AI is shaping developer behavior, and try tracking your Copilot usage with the new [metrics dashboard](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-copilot-usage-metrics-dashboard-and-api-in-public-preview/).

## Conclusion

AI is not just speeding up the pace of development—it's fundamentally changing *which* tools developers choose and *how* they architect software. As teams realign workflows around these shifting convenience loops, both developers and leaders can maximize value by combining flexible AI-powered tools with clear architectural and process standards.
