# How Dow Uses Microsoft Security Copilot and AI to Transform Cybersecurity Operations

Dow, a globally recognized materials science company with over 125 years of history, has taken significant steps to modernize its security practices by embracing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation. Led by Chief Information Security Officer Mario Ferket, Dow’s global security team ensures the safety of employees, customers, and terabytes of sensitive data.

## Responsible AI and Modern Security Strategy

Dow’s security transformation began with the creation of a cross-functional, responsible AI team. Collaborating with the Enterprise Data and Analytics group, Legal, and other departments, this team established core principles and acceptable use policies for generative AI. As AI tools like Microsoft Security Copilot were rolled out, the team focused on understanding and mitigating new risk factors posed by these technologies.

## Leveraging Microsoft Security Copilot

Dow partnered with Microsoft Security to implement several advanced capabilities. Security Copilot became central to their Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC), providing:

- Enhanced detection and removal of phishing, BEC attempts, and other threats
- Automation of repetitive manual tasks for improved operational efficiency
- Threat hunting augmentation and automated incident summarization
- Ticket enrichment by integrating insights from external intelligence sources
- Natural language querying to speed up investigations

Ferket notes that the phrase “Have you asked Copilot?” is now standard in daily investigations, reflecting the quick uptake of Security Copilot within the team.

## Real-World Impact and Lessons Learned

- Security Copilot’s automation enables analysts to focus energy on proactive and advanced security work rather than manual data collation.
- Natural language search allows security analysts to draw insights more efficiently, reducing time from alert to actionable steps.
- The apprenticeship program benefits from using Security Copilot as a “virtual mentor,” accelerating training for new team members and freeing up senior analysts for critical defense operations.

## Looking Ahead: Innovation in AI-Driven Security

Dow is planning several innovations:

- Advanced anomaly and pattern detection across large-scale telemetry data
- Intelligent automation to reduce rule management workload
- Dynamic alert prioritization using contextual and threat intelligence signals
- Ongoing vigilance toward the evolving use of AI in both defense and offense

## Advice for Security Teams Starting Their AI Journey

Ferket advises peers to remain agile and prioritize organizational objectives over chasing new AI features. Recognize current AI limitations and be ready to adapt as capabilities evolve. At Dow, AI augments human analysts, allowing focus on high-value activities.
