# Announcing Azure Copilot Agents and AI Infrastructure Innovations

**Author:** Jeremy Winter  
**Event:** Microsoft Ignite 2025  

Learn about the new capabilities and improvements in Microsoft Azure unveiled during Microsoft Ignite 2025:

## Azure Copilot and Agentic Cloud Operations

Azure introduces Azure Copilot—a next-generation AI-powered agentic interface orchestrating specialized agents for platform automation. Key features include:

- Automation of migration, modernization, optimization, troubleshooting, and resiliency operations
- A unified governance framework with role-based access control and auditing
- Six Copilot agents (for migration, deployment, optimization, observability, resiliency, troubleshooting) now in preview
- Deep compliance, governance, and customer data control (bring-your-own-storage for agent data)

Teams benefit from reduced repetitive tasks, streamlined workflows, and increased focus on architecture and innovation instead of administration.

## Azure’s Expanding AI Infrastructure

Azure continues its investment in advanced infrastructure, with major highlights including:

- **Fairwater Datacenter**: The most powerful AI datacenter to date, built for planetary-scale workloads with high-density liquid cooling and a massive interconnect of NVIDIA GB300 GPUs.
- **AI Superfactory**: Interconnected sites for global-scale model training and deployment
- **AI WAN**: High-speed networking linking sites for rapid data transfer and distributed AI training
- **1.1 Million Token/Second Processing**: Unprecedented language model throughput supporting faster, larger workloads

Latest hardware and network advances empower customers to train larger models, deploy faster, and serve broader audiences with enhanced compliance and trust.

## Innovations in Cloud-Native Apps and Data

Azure is lowering the barrier for cloud-native development:

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Automatic**: Simplifies Kubernetes cluster management with automation of patching, upgrades, observability, and security
- **Azure Boost**: Offloads worker processes for greater throughput (20GB/s managed disk, 1M+ IOPS)
- **New database services**: Azure HorizonDB (PostgreSQL-compatible, scalable with AI integration), DocumentDB, and Cosmos DB enhancements
- **SAP and Microsoft Fabric**: Improved data sharing and analytics integrations across platforms

## Modernizing Workloads and Operations

- **Agentic migration and modernization tools** streamline modernization of .NET, Java, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and legacy workloads, minimizing code changes and operational friction
- **App Service Managed Instance** allows migration of existing .NET apps without refactoring or containers

## Resiliency, Security, and Operational Excellence

Reliability and trust are central to Azure’s infrastructure. New features to strengthen platform operations include:

- **Availability Zones and Zone-Redundant Services**: Further expanded and automated for improved reliability
- **Azure Resiliency (public preview)**: Enables co-engineered recovery objectives, failover testing, and health validation

### Security Enhancements

- **Azure Bastion Secure by Default**: Automatic hardening for VM remote access
- **Network Security Perimeter**: Centralized firewall for secure PaaS access
- **Web Application Firewall with Captcha**: Enhanced verification and defense
- **Confidential VMs and containers, hardware attestation, and deep encryption** underpin platform-wide protection

## Looking Ahead

Azure is doubling down on the agentic, AI-powered, and human-centered vision for the cloud, with innovations spanning infrastructure, services, AI, and operational excellence. The next cloud era is designed to scale smarter, operate securely, and accelerate business transformation.
