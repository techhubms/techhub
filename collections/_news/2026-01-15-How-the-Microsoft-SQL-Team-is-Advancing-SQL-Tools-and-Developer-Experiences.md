# How the Microsoft SQL Team is Advancing SQL Tools and Developer Experiences

The SQL tools and experiences team at Microsoft is committed to empowering data professionals, developers, and engineers at every level. Their mission focuses on evolving the tools, SDKs, and experiences that deliver value across Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL, SQL database in Fabric, and Fabric Data Warehouse.

## Key Areas of Investment

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):**
  - Ongoing modernization, now built on the latest Visual Studio platform.
  - New features include dark mode, Arm64 support, Fabric support, GitHub Copilot integration, and more.
  - Designed to support a broad range of users: DBAs, data analysts, developers, data scientists, and engineers.

- **Visual Studio Code MSSQL Extension:**
  - Expanded AI-assisted experiences via GitHub Copilot Ask and Agent mode.
  - Enhanced schema and table design, provisioning, and connectivity options—including Fabric and local containers.
  - Focused on making application and database development more streamlined and productive.

- **Web and Portal Investments:**
  - Unified Azure SQL experiences in the Azure portal.
  - Enhanced Fabric web interfaces for cross-platform roles and integrated tasks.
  - General availability of SQL database in Fabric and integration into web workflows.

## New Capabilities and Roadmap Highlights

- **AI and GitHub Copilot Integration:**
  - SSMS and VS Code now offer code-centric, AI-powered assistance to accelerate routine database tasks and troubleshooting.
  - Copilot experiences help build and optimize AI-ready applications on Microsoft SQL platforms.

- **DevOps and CI/CD Enhancements:**
  - Vision to equip every database with source control and CI/CD integration.
  - Streamlined, reliable deployments through modern drivers, SDKs, CLIs, and a robust data API.
  - Foundation for database DevOps practices to ensure trusted releases and easier project upgrades.

- **Project Support and Migration:**
  - Guidance for users impacted by Azure Data Studio or SDK-style SQL projects retirement in Visual Studio 2022.
  - SDK-style SQL projects available in VS Code and soon SSMS (2026), with direct integration into Fabric source control.
