# Chart Your AI and Agent Strategy with Microsoft Marketplace

_Author: Cyril Belikoff_

A new wave of organizations is embedding AI across their entire operations to accelerate delivery, scale efficiently, and unlock new business potential. These pioneering 'Frontier Firms' rebuild around AI rather than merely adopting it, using innovation to set the pace for the coming decade.

Choosing the right AI adoption strategy means evaluating the tradeoffs between rapid deployment, long-term value, and organizational fit. Options include building from scratch, buying off-the-shelf, or combining both approaches to meet unique needs.

## Microsoft Marketplace: The Central Hub for AI Solutions

[Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/home) features the largest catalog of AI apps, models, and agents. Organizations can quickly adopt pre-vetted solutions from Microsoft partners, seamlessly integrating them with their Microsoft stack for rapid results and easier cloud management.

Solutions in the Marketplace can be surfaced contextually in tools employees use every day, such as agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot or models in [Microsoft Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/). The platform supports both agility and governance, helping organizations rapidly move from concept to production.

## Build Custom AI Applications

Developers can access over 11,000 prepackaged models and 4,000 AI apps and agents through Marketplace, supporting highly customized solutions.

- **Pro-code development**: Full control over logic, data handling, and governance. Custom-built solutions can tap into Marketplace models from partners like Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, OpenAI, and NVIDIA, integrating rapidly with Azure resources and ensuring security and compliance.
- **Low-code development**: Use [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio/) and pre-built models to design and govern custom copilots and agents with minimal coding, speeding up time-to-value.

Models are accessible directly within the Azure portal and Foundry, so teams can deploy, fine-tune, and secure models within their environments using familiar tools.

## Buy Ready-Made AI Solutions

For organizations with urgent needs or limited resources, purchasing an existing AI application or agent can accelerate innovation. The Marketplace offers a curated selection of proven solutions, many integrated directly into Azure, Microsoft 365, or other cloud investments.

Filter solutions by product, category, or industry, and take advantage of trials or proof-of-concept options. Eligible solutions may count toward an Azure consumption commitment, streamlining procurement and deployment within enterprise environments.

## Blended Strategies: Customization Meets Efficiency

Many businesses choose a hybrid strategy, extending partner solutions with proprietary technology. For example, in financial services, firms can combine pre-built fraud detection ML models with existing data pipelines and systems—deploying secure, compliant solutions faster and refining ML workflows without major internal overhauls.

Marketplace offerings can be deployed inside an organization's Azure tenant using Managed Identity, maintaining data security while blending models and workflows.

## Accelerating Transformation with Microsoft Marketplace

Microsoft Marketplace supports technology leaders and practitioners across the AI adoption journey—streamlining discovery, purchase, and deployment of AI apps, models, and agents. Whether building, buying, or blending, Marketplace enables organizations to quickly deliver measurable business impact at scale.
