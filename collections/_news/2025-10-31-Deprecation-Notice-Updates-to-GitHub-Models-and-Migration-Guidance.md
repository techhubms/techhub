# Deprecated Models in GitHub Models: Migration Guidance

GitHub has announced the deprecation of several existing AI models within GitHub Models. Users of the following models should transition to recommended alternatives to access improved performance and features.

## Deprecated Models and Replacement Recommendations

- **Mistral-Nemo** users should now transition to [Mistral-small-2503](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azureml-mistral/mistral-small-2503).
- **Mistral-large-2411** users are advised to migrate to [Mistral-medium-2505](https://github.com/marketplace/models/azureml-mistral/mistral-medium-2505).
- **Jais-30b-chat** will no longer be available in GitHub Models, and users are encouraged to review documentation for alternative options.

These changes aim to provide access to enhanced model capabilities and continued support.

## Next Steps

- **Model Migration**: Update your workflows to use the recommended replacement models.
- **Review Documentation**: For more information on GitHub Models and detailed migration steps, review the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/github-models).
- **Community Support**: Participate in ongoing [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/models?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3AModels+) for additional support and to share experiences during your migration process.

Staying updated with the latest model offerings ensures your projects benefit from improved features, functionality, and long-term maintainability.
