# .NET Conf 2025 Recap

## Major Announcements

- **.NET 10 Released**: The latest LTS version offers best-in-class runtime performance, expanded cryptography, updates to ASP.NET Core, Blazor, .NET MAUI, and C# 14. Supported through November 2028.
- **Visual Studio 2026**: Delivers an improved, AI-integrated developer experience, modern FluentUI look, enhanced diagnostics, better hot reload, and GitHub Copilot deep integration for productivity.
- **Aspire 13**: Modular, extensible development for cloud-native apps with CLI enhancements and multi-language support (including Python and JavaScript).
- **GitHub Copilot Modernization**: Use Copilot and AI for automated code upgrades, migration to .NET 10, and improved test generation and coverage.
- **Microsoft Agent Framework & MCP SDK**: Empower developers to build intelligent, autonomous AI agents and assistants within .NET, leveraging Microsoft.Extensions.AI for broader AI integration.

## Event Highlights

- **Day 1**: Focused on .NET 10's new features—performance upgrades, C# 14, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, MAUI improvements, AI innovations, and the Visual Studio 2026 launch.
- **Day 2**: Deep dives into Azure (Cloud keynote, Functions, Kubernetes Service, Container Apps), testing platforms, container optimizations, security best practices, and package management with NuGet.
- **Day 3**: Community contributions including clean architecture principles, Xamarin.Forms to .NET MAUI migrations, observability, REST API upgrades with MCP, and advanced C# and F# features.
- **Student Zone**: Beginner-friendly projects in C#/.NET covering AI, web, mobile, and game development.
- **International Reach**: Broadcasts and support for Chinese .NET community members.

## Technical Deep Dives

### AI & ML Innovations

- **Microsoft Agent Framework**: For building multi-agent, intelligent applications with support for concurrent workflows and rich Agentic UI.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.AI**: Unified AI abstraction across providers.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: SDK for connecting AI applications with external tools and services, already deployed in Xbox Gaming Copilot and Copilot Studio (Blazor WebAssembly).
- **AI Foundry, GitHub Copilot**: Modernizing applications and generating tests using AI, rapidly upgrading codebases and improving coverage.

### Developer Experience

- **GitHub Copilot**: Integrated as an AI pair programmer for modernization, refactoring, test generation, code suggestion, and migration to Azure cloud.
- **Performance Upgrades**: .NET 10’s JIT improvements, hardware intrinsics, NativeAOT, and runtime optimizations.
- **Security**: Expanded post-quantum cryptography, hardened defaults, and secure authentication flows (e.g., passkeys in ASP.NET Core Identity, Microsoft Sentinel integrations).

### Ecosystem Updates

- **.NET MAUI**: Android/iOS bindings, improved HybridWebView, XAML source generator, migration support from Xamarin.Forms.
- **Community**: Sessions on clean architecture, observability with OpenTelemetry, API expansion, and real-world case studies.
