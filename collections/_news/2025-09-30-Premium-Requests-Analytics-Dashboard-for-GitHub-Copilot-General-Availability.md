# Premium Requests Analytics Dashboard for GitHub Copilot

GitHub's premium requests analytics dashboard, launching September 29, 2025, provides a detailed interface for tracking Copilot-related usage and billing. The tool enables enterprise owners, organization owners, billing managers, and personal Copilot subscribers to understand how their Copilot premium request consumption contributes to their overall invoices.

## Key Features

- **Total Usage Overview:** View organization-wide or user-specific premium request counts across all products using Copilot premium requests.
- **Quota Tracking:** Clearly distinguish premium requests used within the monthly allowance and those billed above quota.
- **Filtering & Breakdown:** Filter analytics by user, model, organization, and cost center, and access per-user/model breakdowns for precise usage audits.
- **Cost Monitoring:** See gross and billed amounts both in aggregate and by category to identify cost drivers.
- **API Access:** Take advantage of the new dedicated API endpoint for exporting premium requests analytics data. Build custom reports, internal dashboards, and expense trackers to suit your organization's needs. Full API details can be found in the [GitHub billing documentation](https://docs.github.com/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use) and [API documentation](https://docs.github.com/rest/billing/enhanced-billing?apiVersion=2022-11-28).
- **Integration into Billing Platform:** The analytics page is part of the existing GitHub Billing pages, ensuring a familiar experience and security model.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Visibility:** Enterprise and organization owners can quickly spot usage patterns and tailor internal processes or Copilot adoption strategies accordingly.
- **Expense Management:** Billing managers can track Copilot premium usage across teams, prepare for budgeting, and ensure transparency in billing.
- **Developer Insights:** Individual developers and teams gain actionable feedback on usage, helping them optimize their workflow and costs.
- **Automation:** With API access, organizations can automate recurring reports or integrate analytics into centralized BI tools.
