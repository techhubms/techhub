# AI Agent Lifecycle, Security, and Observability: Highlights from Microsoft Ignite 2025

Microsoft Ignite 2025 showcased how Microsoft is advancing AI as a core part of modern organizations, from ideation and building agents to deployment, governance, and real-world impact.

## AI Innovation Across the Enterprise

Microsoft positions AI as a transformative force, not just an add-on. The new tools unveiled—Work IQ, Copilot Studio, Foundry IQ, Fabric IQ—are designed to integrate AI deeply into workflows and business intelligence, enabling organizations ("Frontier Firms") to unlock creativity and drive innovation.

- **Work IQ** powers Microsoft 365 Copilot and agent ecosystems, leveraging company knowledge to enable intelligent, contextual recommendations and agent actions.
- **Fabric IQ** bridges analytical, time series, and location-based data, integrating business operations with real-time intelligence. Power BI users benefit from seamless data model acceleration for AI agent context.
- **Foundry IQ** provides a fully managed system for grounding agents across data sources (Microsoft 365, Fabric IQ, custom apps, and web), supporting reasoning, safety, and value creation.
- **Copilot Studio** enables rapid agent creation for unique workflows and business needs, with APIs available for extensibility.

## Building and Deploying Agents

The Microsoft Agent Factory supports organizations in building, deploying, and managing agents with a unified plan, covering Copilot Studio and Foundry integrations. This allows enterprises to deploy agents anywhere, including Microsoft 365 Copilot, with no upfront licensing or provisioning.

Advanced support from AI Forward Deployed Engineers and training resources help teams boost their AI fluency and implement solutions confidently.

## Observability and Security at Scale

With projection of 1.3 billion business AI agents automating workflows by 2028, monitoring, security, and governance become critical. Microsoft Agent 365 addresses this challenge:

- **Observability**: Tracks and manages agents created through various platforms (Microsoft, open-source, third-party).
- **Security & Governance**: Integrates Microsoft Defender, Entra, Purview, and Foundry Control Plane for agent protection and compliance management.
- **Productivity Integration**: Agents gain access to productivity tools (Microsoft 365 apps, Work IQ) and are managed via Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Additional Announcements and Resources
