# GitHub Copilot Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Enhancements

GitHub Copilot now offers expanded capabilities for enterprise users leveraging Bring Your Own Key (BYOK). These improvements provide more flexibility, security, and integration options for organizations adopting Copilot at scale.

## Key New Features

- **Expanded Provider Support**: Enterprises can now connect API keys from AWS Bedrock, Google AI Studio, and any OpenAI‑compatible provider. This is in addition to previously supported integrations with Anthropic, Microsoft Foundry, OpenAI, and xAI.

- **Responses API Support**: BYOK now works with models that use the Responses API, enabling richer structured outputs and enhanced multimodal interactions within Copilot workflows.

- **Maximum Context Window Configuration**: Admins have the ability to set a maximum context window for model interactions, which helps optimize cost, performance, and response quality according to organizational needs.

- **Streaming Outputs**: Connected models now support streaming responses, allowing Copilot to display generated content in real time—improving user feedback and interaction during code completion or chat sessions.

## Getting Started

These features are available in public preview for GitHub Enterprise and Business customers. To use them:

1. Go to your enterprise or organization settings in GitHub.
2. Connect your preferred LLM provider’s API key (from supported providers).
3. Start using your chosen models within Copilot Chat and supported IDEs.
4. For additional guidance, review the [BYOK documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-enterprise/use-your-own-api-keys).

## Community and Feedback

GitHub encourages users to provide feedback to help shape future Copilot features. Participate in ongoing discussions within the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/184350) to share your thoughts and connect with other developers.
