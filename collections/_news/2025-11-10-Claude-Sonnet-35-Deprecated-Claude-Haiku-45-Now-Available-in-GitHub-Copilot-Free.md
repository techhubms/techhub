# Claude Sonnet 3.5 Deprecated—Claude Haiku 4.5 Now Available in Copilot Free

As of November 10th, 2025, GitHub Copilot has deprecated the Claude Sonnet 3.5 model across all Copilot experiences—including Copilot Chat, inline edits, ask and agent modes, and code completions. In its place, Copilot Free users can now access Claude Haiku 4.5, an improved AI model from Anthropic that offers enhanced coding capabilities at no cost.

| Model               | Deprecation date | Suggested alternative              |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Claude Sonnet 3.5   | 2025-11-10      | Claude Sonnet 4.5 (paid), Claude Haiku 4.5 (Copilot Free) |

**What to do next:**

- **Update workflows and integrations** to use the supported models.
- **Copilot Enterprise administrators** may need to enable access to alternative models through their Copilot settings’ model policy features.
    - To confirm availability, check your individual Copilot settings and verify that the policy for the new model is enabled.
    - Once enabled, the new model will appear in the Copilot Chat model selector in Visual Studio Code and on github.com.
- **No action is required to remove deprecated models;** they are no longer available by default.

**Further Resources:**

- Learn more about supported models in Copilot: [GitHub documentation on models](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models)
