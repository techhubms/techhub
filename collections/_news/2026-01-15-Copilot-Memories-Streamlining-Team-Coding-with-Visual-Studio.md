Jessie Houghton introduces Copilot Memories, a new feature for Visual Studio users that automates capturing, sharing, and maintaining coding standards and preferences for development teams.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Copilot Memories: Streamlining Team Coding with Visual Studio

Copilot Memories is a new feature designed to make it easier for developers and teams using Visual Studio to follow code standards, project preferences, and important contribution guidelines. Instead of manual reminders and scattered documentation, Copilot Memories captures, remembers, and shares key team details automatically.

## How Copilot Memories Enhances Teamwork

- **Intelligent Detection:** Copilot Memories observes coding habits and project needs, learning team and individual preferences as you work. It then surfaces these standards contextually, reducing the likelihood of overlooked details.
- **Confirmation Nudges:** Whenever Copilot suggests saving or updating a memory, developers receive a clear prompt to review, accept, or adjust, ensuring full control over changes.
- **Organized Guidance:** Preferences and guidelines are stored either in personal user files (`%USERPROFILE%/copilot-instructions.md`) or in repo-level instructions (`/.github/copilot-instructions.md`). Copilot can intelligently merge new data into existing files or create new instruction files as needed.
- **Improved Onboarding:** New project members gain immediate insight into a team's coding practices, while experienced team members save time by letting Copilot maintain documentation and preferences naturally.
