# GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio 2026 — January Update

January 2026 introduced a suite of new capabilities for GitHub Copilot users in Visual Studio 2026, focusing on developer productivity and a smoother coding experience.

## Highlights

- **Colorized Code Completions**: Code suggestions now support syntax highlighting, making it easier for developers to distinguish variables, functions, and other elements directly within completion suggestions. This feature can be enabled via settings under **Use colorized text for code completions**.

- **Partial Acceptance of Completions**: Developers can now accept only part of a Copilot code suggestion by clicking within the suggestion itself. When hovering the cursor, segments of the suggestion are highlighted, allowing for greater precision in accepting code up to the cursor position.

- **Productivity Improvements**: Several improvements have been rolled out based on community feedback. Notable enhancements include:
  - Faster scrolling performance
  - Enhanced HTML-rich copy-paste
  - Syntactic line compression
  - Additional customization options for the Visual Studio editor

- **Enhanced Markdown Preview Controls**: New options let developers switch between Split Preview, Open Preview, and Edit Markdown modes for greater flexibility when working with documentation and markdown files. Zoom controls have also been added to assist with diagram previews (including Mermaid diagrams). The Copilot Chat feature now includes a Preview button, which allows users to render and edit generated markdown directly. These features are available in the Stable channel.

## Getting Started

Developers can [download Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) to try all these new features.
