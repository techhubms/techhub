# Infostealer Malware Expands to macOS and Cross-Platform Targets: Defender XDR Insights and Mitigation

**By Microsoft Defender Security Research Team**

## Overview

Infostealer threats are no longer confined to Windows. Recent campaigns target macOS, abuse Python for cross-platform reach, and exploit popular platforms and utilities (e.g. WhatsApp, PDF editors) to distribute credential-stealing malware. This report summarizes the technical evolution of these threats and provides actionable mitigation guidance leveraging Microsoft Defender XDR.

## Key Threat Activity

### macOS Infostealer Campaigns

- Attackers use deceptive websites, malvertising (e.g. Google Ads), and social engineering ('ClickFix' style prompts) to trick macOS users into running malicious DMGs or pasting commands into Terminal.
- Stealers like **DigitStealer**, **MacSync**, and **Atomic Stealer (AMOS)** harvest credentials, browser passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and developer keys, then exfiltrate this data and erase infection traces.
- Targeted data can provide attackers access to banking, email, cloud infrastructure, and source code repositories.

### Python-Based Infostealer Proliferation

- Attackers increasingly develop infostealers in Python, enabling rapid code reuse and multi-OS targeting.
- **PXA Stealer** is highlighted: distributed via phishing, it collects logins, auth tokens, credit cards, and more. Tactics include obfuscated Python scripts, use of Telegram for C2, and defenses evasion via renamed interpreters and sideloaded DLLs.
- Outcomes include data breaches, BEC, and further malware deployment.

### Abuse of Trusted Platforms (WhatsApp, PDF Tools)

- **WhatsApp**: Campaigns used VBS and batch scripts to launch PowerShell payloads, which deploy Python-based stealers and propagate via hijacked WhatsApp accounts.
- **Crystal PDF**: Fake PDF editors (CrystalPDF.exe) distributed via malvertising act as info stealers, targeting cookies, session, and credential data from browsers.

## Mitigation Recommendations

**1. Strengthen User Awareness & Execution Safeguards**

- Educate users about social engineering, malvertising, and copy-paste terminal tricks on macOS.
- Discourage installation of unsigned DMGs or unofficial fixes.

**2. Harden macOS Against Tool Abuse**

- Monitor Terminal activity (e.g. `curl`, `base64`, `osascript`), in-memory pipelines, and AppleScript.
- Use Defender custom rules to alert on Keychain, browser stores, and developer/Cloud keys access.

**3. Control Outbound Traffic**

- Inspect egress for POSTs to suspicious domains and ZIP archive exfiltration events.
- Block outbound connections to known C2 infrastructure.

**4. Protect Against Python & Cross-platform Payloads**

- Harden defenses around LOLBIN abuse (e.g., `certutil.exe`) and process hollowing.
- Watch for AutoIt activity in malware campaigns.

**5. Enable Microsoft Defender XDR Capabilities**

- Turn on cloud protection, EDR in block mode, and Defender SmartScreen across browsers.
- Use tamper protection and attack surface reduction rules against obfuscated scripts and malware delivery.

## Defender XDR Detection and Hunting

- Defender XDR provides detections for suspicious executions, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, exfiltration, and C2 traffic.
- Multiple hunting queries are provided to help incident responders identify activity related to DigitStealer, MacSync, AMOS, PXA Stealer, WhatsApp/Eternidade Stealer, and malicious PDF installers.
- A list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) and domains is included.
- Microsoft Sentinel customers can integrate threat intelligence rules for automatic detection.

## References & Additional Learning

- Linked articles with further technical deep-dives and offensive methodology.
- Guidance on securing Copilot Studio agents with Defender (see [Defender Copilot Studio agent security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/ai-agent-protection)).

## Conclusion

Modern infostealer threats challenge security teams across platforms, requiring both technical and educational countermeasures. Microsoft Defender XDR offers actionable, integrated threat detection and response for these evolving risks.
