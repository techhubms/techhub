# How Chemist Warehouse Uses Azure AI Foundry for HR Transformation

Chemist Warehouse, one of Australia’s largest pharmacy chains, faced significant HR operational challenges—overseeing 30,000 employees with a small centralized HR Advisory Team. High repetition and heavy workloads led to burnout and high turnover.

To address this, Chemist Warehouse, in partnership with Insurgence AI and Microsoft, developed an AI-powered solution named **AIHRA** (AI HR Advisory). Built using **Microsoft Azure AI Foundry** and **Power Platform**, AIHRA uses advanced AI logic to triage queries from the HR mailbox and draft response emails for HR Advisors, who then review, adjust, and send them.

## System Overview

- **Core Technologies**: Microsoft Azure AI Foundry, Power Platform
- **Integration**: Works with Microsoft Outlook, Fair Work Australia databases, and internal policy documents
- **Model**: AI generates draft responses for low-to-moderate-risk HR topics (e.g., leave, probation management, casual employee status)
- **Human in the loop**: All AI-generated drafts are reviewed by human Advisors

## Impact and Outcomes

- **Efficiency**: AIHRA saves an estimated 1,950 hours per year for the HR team
- **Onboarding**: New HR staff achieve high productivity within weeks
- **Strategic Value**: Frees up HR Advisors for higher value work (coaching, educational content)
- **Service Quality**: Maintained and even improved response quality and consistency
- **Cultural Shift**: Helped retain staff, attract new talent, and encourage innovation in HR

## Development and Scaling

- **Agile Delivery**: Built and launched in 10 weeks, now evolving via frequent iterations
- **AI Governance**: Chemist Warehouse is creating a scalable AI governance framework with Microsoft and Insurgence AI for ongoing maturity and additional use-cases

## Lessons Learned / Best Practices

- Start with targeted use cases where automation delivers measurable impact
- Keep a human in the loop to ensure quality and maintain trust
- Integration with existing enterprise systems (e.g., Outlook) smooths adoption
- Iterative rollout allows for incremental improvement and staff training

## Conclusion

Chemist Warehouse's adoption of Microsoft Azure-based AI for HR advisory showcases how tailored AI solutions, cloud integration, and human review can address real-world enterprise pain points at scale.
