# GPT-5.2 Integration Across Microsoft Tools: AI Model Choice and Developer Impact

**Curated by stclarke**

## Overview

Microsoft, in partnership with OpenAI, is rolling out GPT‑5.2 across its ecosystem. This new model is natively integrated into tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Copilot Studio, and Microsoft Foundry, with a focus on both advanced reasoning capabilities and everyday productivity.

Highlights:

- **GPT‑5.2 Thinking**: Designed for complex problem solving, long-context reasoning, coding, spreadsheets, and presentations.
- **GPT‑5.2 Instant**: Prioritizes efficiency in writing, translation, and skill-building.
- **Work IQ**: A feature for unlocking market research, insights, and strategic planning by reasoning across varied work data.
- **Model Selection**: Users and the Copilot platform can choose or auto-select between models for best task fit.

## Key Integrations & Capabilities

- **GitHub Copilot**: GPT‑5.2 brings multi-purpose enhancements, especially in code reasoning and analysis of large/complex codebases.
- **Copilot Studio & Microsoft Foundry**: GPT‑5.2 models now power workflow automation and enterprise analytics.
- **Microsoft 365 Copilot**: GPT‑5.2 available for enterprise tasks such as analyzing meetings, emails, and docs with Work IQ.

## Community and Practitioner Insights

- **Practitioner Feedback**:
  - Use in cybersecurity automation, market analysis, research, and enterprise operations.
  - Calls for better model accountability—users want transparency into why, when, and how different GPT-5.2 models are selected, especially when work data sensitivity is involved.
  - Discussion on the practical impact on developer experience and workflow automation across the Microsoft stack.
  - Some highlight competitive pressure and express skepticism about Copilot’s current value compared to other consumer AI options.

## Example Practitioner Quotes

- “GPT-5.2 is a fantastic multi-purpose model, especially when it comes to long-context and reasoning when coding or investigating a complex code base.”

- “We’re already seeing how GPT-5.2’s long-context reasoning and Work IQ reshape enterprise operations when paired with the Microsoft stack.”

- “Model choice is powerful, but auto-selection hides the reasoning. When Copilot picks GPT-5.2 Thinking over Instant for your spreadsheet, what exists to show you why?”

## Implications for Developers

- Expanded model support in GitHub Copilot means more powerful code suggestions, deeper reasoning, and improved handling of large code bases.
- Automation and workflow benefits in Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry can increase productivity and analytic insights for enterprise users.
- Practitioners encourage Microsoft to make model decisions more transparent and maintain a focus on practical improvements.
