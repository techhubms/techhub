# Empowering Youth in the Age of AI: Research, Policy, and the AI Futures Youth Council

**Author:** stclarke

## Introduction

Microsoft reaffirms its dedication to empowering young people to use technology safely, responsibly, and productively as AI continues to shape their digital futures. This article summarizes recent research findings, policy recommendations, and the announcement of the AI Futures Youth Council, which brings together youth voices to guide the future direction of responsible AI development and governance.

## AI Futures Youth Council & Research

- **AI Futures Youth Council:** Microsoft is launching a youth council involving teens from the US and Europe to represent young people's perspectives on responsible AI design and use.
- **For Teens, By Teens:** The company is developing resources such as an AI chatbots guide co-created with teens from Asia-Pacific.
- **Global Research:** In collaboration with Praesidio Safeguarding, research was conducted across the UK, Ghana, and Indonesia to examine how young people perceive age assurance mechanisms online.
- **Key Findings:** Teens value transparency on data usage, worry about exclusion without formal age proof, have mixed comfort with biometric and behavioral data, and express a need for both parental involvement and growing independence.
- **Contextual Differences:** In Ghana, for instance, shared family devices/accounts highlight the importance of flexible, context-aware safeguards.

## Policy Recommendations

- **Targeted Age Assurance:** Avoid blanket access restrictions; use nuanced, risk-based age assurance to prevent limiting children’s rights while protecting them from specific online harms.
- **Proportionate Safeguards:** Match safety interventions to the risks associated with specific content and features, emphasizing flexibility and interoperability.
- **AI Companions:** Stronger safeguards and commonsense regulation are needed for AI-driven companions, especially to mitigate risks of self-injury and exposure to harmful content.
- **Age-Appropriate Design:** Support a duty-of-care approach with evidence-based regulatory guidance, avoiding outright bans while encouraging services to customize experiences for young users.
- **Privacy and Security:** Encourage privacy-preserving age assurance methods, cautioning against broad, intrusive verification at the app store level. Support for trusted digital identity ecosystems is advocated.
- **Parental and Family Support:** Equip families with tools and education, while ensuring responsibility does not fall entirely on parents.
- **Multistakeholder Collaboration:** Emphasize the importance of continuous engagement between youth, civil society, policymakers, and technology providers to shape effective, practical, and rights-respecting solutions.

## Conclusion

Microsoft underscores ongoing collaboration and learning with the introduction of the AI Futures Youth Council and by sharing actionable policy recommendations. The focus remains on developing practical, inclusive approaches to AI governance and child safety, encouraging public dialogue and education as technology—and relevant regulation—continues to evolve.
