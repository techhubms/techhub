Microsoft Fabric Blog announces a new native graph data management and analytics service in Microsoft Fabric. This service empowers enterprises to harness relationship-rich insights, with features for business users, analysts, data engineers, and developers.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Introducing Graph Data Management and Analytics in Microsoft Fabric

Microsoft Fabric introduces a comprehensive native graph data management, analytics, and visualization service purpose-built for the era of AI and interconnected data. This new offering leverages a horizontally scalable, native graph engine designed to help organizations of any size manage, analyze, and visualize complex, interconnected data with unprecedented flexibility.

## The Need for Relationship-First Data

Modern industries—ranging from logistics to banking and e-commerce—face challenges related to complex, deeply interconnected data. Traditional relational models and their reliance on complex joins often fail to provide the agility or performance needed in these multi-domain scenarios. Graph analytics, on the other hand, models entities and relationships as networks, making multi-hop dependencies and hidden patterns much easier to analyze and act upon.

Some example scenarios include:

- **Fraud detection** in banking, by modeling connections between accounts, transactions, and merchants
- **Supply chain optimization** through multi-hop asset tracking and dependency mapping
- **E-commerce personalization** using customer journey and product catalog relationships

Graph analytics enables a 360° view of entities, allowing for faster detection of fraud, smarter product recommendations, and optimized business operations.

## Microsoft Fabric's Native Graph Service

Delivered as an integrated part of Microsoft Fabric and OneLake (Fabric's unified data lake), the new graph service offers:

- **Horizontally scalable native graph engine** for large-scale analytics
- **Unified access** to organizational data with no heavy ETL or duplication
- **Rich role-based experiences:**
  - **Business users:** Visual exploration and natural language graph querying
  - **Analysts:** No/low-code pattern building, customizable diagram and tabular views
  - **Data engineers:** Low/no-code schema mapping from nodes/edges to OneLake sources, and easy publishing of graph models
  - **Developers:** Advanced GQL query editor and programmatic integration for apps and AI agents
- **Real-time analytics and explainable AI**, grounding generative AI and LLMs with reliable, relationship-driven context

## Key Benefits and Use Cases

- **No heavy ETL:** Data remains in OneLake—no duplication required
- **Instant insights:** Quickly build graphs from sales, marketing, service, operations, and more
- **Multi-hop analysis:** Effortlessly trace relationships and uncover hidden clusters and patterns
- **Comprehensive tooling:** Supports everyone from business users to advanced developers

Examples of application areas:

- Fraud rings identification
- Optimizing supply chain dependencies
- Customer journey analysis
- Asset hierarchy mapping

## Integrating with AI

Pairing the graph service with Copilot and LLMs (Large Language Models) enhances the explainability, relevance, and precision of AI-generated answers. AI agents and orchestration tools are empowered with richer, contextual knowledge of how data is related, enabling safer automation and more grounded intelligence.
