Allison introduces a new GitHub Mobile feature allowing users to comment on unchanged lines in pull request files, streamlining mobile code reviews.<!--excerpt_end-->

# GitHub Mobile: Comment on Unchanged Lines in Pull Request Files

GitHub Mobile now allows users to comment anywhere within a changed file when reviewing pull requests. Previously, comments could only be made on lines directly connected to code changes, limiting reviewers’ ability to provide feedback or suggest improvements away from the diff context.

**Key Feature Updates:**

- **Expanded Commenting:** The Files Changed view now supports expanding the diff to include unchanged code, enabling users to add comments or suggestions wherever relevant.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Comments added to unchanged lines on github.com are visible in GitHub Mobile, preserving review context when switching between desktop and mobile.
- **Improved Review Workflow:** This makes it easier to highlight missing changes, discuss context beyond immediate code changes, and offer suggestions on the full scope of the file.
- **Availability:** The feature is now accessible in the latest production build on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android).

For discussion and feedback, join the conversation in the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).

### Why it Matters

Being able to provide precise feedback—whether on changed or unchanged lines—helps teams maintain code quality and communication, especially when reviewing complex pull requests on the go.
