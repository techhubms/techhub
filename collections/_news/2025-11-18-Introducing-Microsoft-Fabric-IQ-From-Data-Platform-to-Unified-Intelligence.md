Microsoft Fabric Blog announces the release of Fabric IQ at Ignite 2025, an advanced intelligence platform unifying data, semantic modeling, and agentic AI to power real-time decisions and business optimization.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Introducing Microsoft Fabric IQ: From Data Platform to Unified Intelligence

Microsoft Fabric IQ, unveiled at Microsoft Ignite 2025, is the next evolution of Microsoft Fabric—a shift from unified data to unified intelligence. Fabric IQ integrates semantic modeling, agentic AI, and democratized ontology tooling to empower organizations to interpret and act on their data in real time.

## Key Highlights

- **Unified Intelligence Platform:** Fabric IQ is not a replacement for your data estate but a multiplier, leveraging Power BI's SaaS foundation and integrating pipelines, engineering, warehousing, science, and analytics with OneLake as the core.
  - Eliminates silos and tool sprawl, creating a governed, single source of truth.
- **Real-Time Intelligence:** Extends Fabric's capabilities to real-time analytics. Organizations stream, analyze, and act on live data, driving instant outcomes.
  - Examples from Qcells and Apollo Hospitals show operational improvements with real-time visibility and proactive decision-making.
- **Semantic Intelligence and Ontology:** The new Ontology item enables business experts to model entities, relationships, properties, actions, and rules, using no-code visual tools. Teams and AI agents now reason about the business through semantic understanding, instead of just consuming raw data.
- **Agentic AI:** Fabric IQ introduces Operations Agent and Data Agent:
  - **Operations Agent:** Monitors live signals, reasons over conditions, and acts autonomously to advance business objectives, balancing cost, speed, and customer impact.
  - **Data Agent:** Answers business questions grounded in structured understanding.
- **Integrated Capabilities:** Fabric IQ combines Ontology, Semantic Model, Graph engine, and operational agents into a coherent semantic backbone, enabling continuous, machine-scale decisions.
  - Direct integration with existing Power BI models for quick onboarding.
- **Extending Across Microsoft Ecosystem:** Fabric IQ connects with Microsoft Foundry and Work IQ, forming a unified intelligence layer spanning business data, documents, and communications.
- **Continuous Updates:** Microsoft reports new capabilities in Fabric Real-Time Intelligence—Fabric Graph enhancements, eventstream sources, and geospatial updates.

## How Fabric IQ Works

- **Ontology Modeling:** Users can define business entities (e.g., flights, pilots, assets), their relationships, and governing rules, crafting a live, evolving model mapped to real business data.
- **Democratized Access:** No-code tools let business users build and adapt their semantic models. IT manages versioning, governance, and security.
- **Live Connected Data:** Every semantic component links to OneLake, integrating analytical, real-time, geospatial, and time-series data views.
- **Agents for Action and Insight:** Data Agents answer business questions using structured context; Operations Agents monitor, reason, and act for continuous optimization.
- **Real-Time, Semantic Decisions:** AI agents leverage business-defined ontology for context-aware, trustworthy autonomous decisions.
