Allison details recent improvements to GitHub's pull request review process, showing developers how to access and manage all comments directly from the Files changed page without leaving their code review context.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Access All Pull Request Comments Without Leaving the Files Changed Page

GitHub has introduced a set of updates to improve the pull request review experience:

- **Unified Comment Panel:**
  - You can now view all general comments on a pull request directly from the **Comments** panel in the new “Files changed” page. This removes the need to switch between “Files changed” and the “Conversation” tabs, letting reviewers track high-level discussions and code changes side by side.
- **Add and Reply to Comments:**
  - The panel allows you to add new comments or quote reply to existing ones, helping keep discussions contextual and organized.
- **Improved Comment Filters:**
  - Resolved and unresolved comment filters now display states accurately, and update in real time as you interact with the panel.
- **Streamlined Change Request Reviews:**
  - When requesting changes on a pull request, you no longer have to add a summary if you have already provided comments—making the review process more efficient.

## Feedback and Discussion

You can report feedback, problems, and ask questions regarding these improvements in the [“Files changed” preview feedback discussion](https://gh.io/new-files-changed-feedback).
