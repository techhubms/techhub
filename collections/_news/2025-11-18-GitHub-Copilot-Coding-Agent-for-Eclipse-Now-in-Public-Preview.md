# GitHub Copilot Coding Agent for Eclipse: Public Preview

GitHub Copilot's coding agent is now available in public preview for Eclipse, bringing AI-powered coding assistance and automation directly to Eclipse workflows.

## What’s New

- **Task Delegation from Eclipse**: You can now describe a coding task in Copilot Chat and delegate it to the Copilot agent without leaving your IDE. The agent executes the task in GitHub’s managed cloud, opens a draft pull request, and queues it for review automatically.
- **Inline Job Tracking**: A job card appears in Copilot Chat showing live status, links to the draft PR, and quick actions to manage the task. There’s also a new *GitHub Coding Agent Jobs* sidebar view for tracking all tasks, past and present.

## How It Works

1. **Prerequisites**: Secure a [GitHub Copilot license](https://github.com/features/copilot) and ensure you have write access to your repository.
2. **Open Copilot Chat**: Access Copilot Chat within Eclipse, where you can choose between Agent and Ask modes.
3. **Assign Tasks**: Enter your coding request in the chat and use the **Delegate to coding agent** button to initiate Copilot's agent.
4. **Track Progress**: After delegation, monitor the status in the job card, open the related pull request on GitHub, or track everything seamlessly inside Eclipse.
5. **Manage Sessions**: Use Eclipse’s built-in PR tools to view diffs, check status, or cancel sessions. Receive real-time notifications for task updates or errors.
