# Roadmap for AI and GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio: February Update

**Author:** Rhea Patel

This February, Visual Studio shifts its AI and GitHub Copilot focus to improving reliability, refining core workflows, and laying a stronger foundation for agent-driven coding assistance. Below is a detailed summary of the roadmap and active workstreams:

## 1. Agent Mode & Coding Agents

- Enhanced progress and status indicators for long-running operations ([discussion link](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Better-progress-and-status-indicators-du/11038992))
- Improved failure handling and retry mechanisms for agents ([details](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Improved-Failure-Handling-and-Retries-fo/11038990))
- Better diagnostics and logging to troubleshoot issues ([read more](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Diagnostics-and-logging-improvements-to/11038993))
- User experience enhancements for chat history and agent mode interactions ([UX thread](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/UX-Improvements-%E2%80%93-Chat-History--Agent/11039013))
- Added support for agent skills ([skills proposal](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Add-Agent-Skills-for-Copilot/11038989))
- Unified sessions for coding agents ([unified sessions](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Coding-Agent--Unified-Sessions/11039017))

## 2. Planning Agent

- Early work on a dedicated agent designed for multi-step task planning and execution ([planning agent info](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Dedicated-Planning-Agent-built-in/11038996))

## 3. Copilot SDK & Platform Integration (Experimental)

- Exploring tighter integration between Copilot CLI and Visual Studio Copilot ([integration plans](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Integrating-the-GitHub-Copilot-CLI-and-S/11038998))

## 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- Work continues to make model context manageable as solution complexity scales
- Implementation of Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) for governance ([CIMD details](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Client-ID-Metadata-Documents-CIMD-for/11039001))
- Visual Studio adds new governance capabilities for MCP servers ([governance thread](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-enables-governance-to-supp/10951779?sort=relevance&scope=follow))

## 5. Models & Context Management

- Enhanced handling of large or complex code contexts ([details](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Simplify-Context-Architecture/11039012))
- Simplified strategies for context reduction and capping to avoid unexpected AI behavior

## 6. Copilot Experience in Editor

- New shortcuts for accepting Copilot suggestions ([keyboard shortcut thread](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Copilot-keyboard-shortcut-to-accept-sugg/10605774#T-ND11010484))
- Reducing interference between IntelliSense and Copilot ([conflict resolution discussion](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Avoid-IntelliSense-and-Copilot-conflicts/11038262))
- Easier access to Copilot help and suggestions from editor quick info ([support thread](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Easier-Copilot-support-from-editor-quick/11038315))
