# Securing Critical Infrastructure: Microsoft Insights on Europe's Risk-Based Cybersecurity Regulations

**Author: Freddy Dezeure (as recounted by stclarke)**

## Introduction

In this addition to the Deputy CISO blog series, Freddy Dezeure, Deputy CISO for Europe at Microsoft, examines the societal stakes and realities of defending critical infrastructure in the face of rising cyber threats. This article highlights how European legislation—specifically NIS2 and DORA—elevates the role of the CISO and outlines strategic approaches to enhance cyber resilience.

## The Increasing Stakes of Cybersecurity

Modern society relies on interconnected technologies: hospitals, power grids, communication networks, and financial systems are all targets for increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. Attacks now jeopardize more than data; they threaten essential services and human well-being. Microsoft asserts that security is fundamental, not just a feature, and emphasizes its commitment to upholding Europe’s new cybersecurity regulations.

## The Cyberthreat Landscape

The 2025 Microsoft Digital Defense Report documents advanced cybercrime, including:

- Organized cybercriminals utilizing access brokerage models
- State-sponsored actors evolved beyond espionage, now targeting logistics, law enforcement, and infrastructure
- Real-world impacts: disrupted emergency care, transportation, and education
- Growing exploitation of edge devices such as routers and VPNs

As cyberthreats become business and societal risks, organizations must elevate their security postures accordingly.

## NIS2 and DORA: Reframing the CISO Role

Two new EU initiatives are changing the game:

### NIS2

- Applies to all critical sectors, enforcing higher cybersecurity standards
- Mandates risk management, real-time incident reporting, and board-level oversight

### DORA

- Targets digital resilience within EU financial entities
- Boards of directors are now directly accountable for cybersecurity
- Enforces compliance with training, knowledge, and hands-on oversight

Both legislations emphasize a risk-based approach and encode best practices—such as multifactor authentication, cryptography, and supply chain security—into law. Directors and CISOs must go beyond compliance, building strategies that ensure resilience and continuity.

## Focusing on What Matters: Key Control Indicators (KCIs)

The article stresses that “less is more” in effective cybersecurity. Instead of attempting to implement every possible control, CISOs should identify and monitor high-impact controls. The CISO Metrics Working Group proposes KCIs, such as:

- ICT asset inventory
- Privileged account management
- Timely patching
- Reliable backups
- Endpoint protection
- Log collection/reporting
- Network security configuration
- Identity management (phishing-resistant MFA)
- Resilience testing (including red teaming and cryptography)

Each KCI is meant to be tailored to the organization's sector and specific threat environment.

## Microsoft’s Commitments and Guidance

Microsoft’s own response includes new digital resilience commitments for Europe, enhanced security options, and continuous sharing of intelligence and best practices. Supplementary resources for practitioners are provided, including the Dutch Cyber Security Council’s [Guide to Cybersecurity for Directors and Business Owners](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/394485635_Guide_to_Cybersecurity_for_Directors_and_Business_Owners) and the [Microsoft Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/cybersecurity/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025/).

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity and resilience demand both strategic and operational focus—especially for organizations providing vital public services. The evolving EU regulatory landscape is pushing CISOs, boards, and security teams toward risk-based, verifiable, and actionable practices that protect critical infrastructure in the digital age.
