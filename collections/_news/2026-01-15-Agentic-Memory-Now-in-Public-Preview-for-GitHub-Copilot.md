# Agentic Memory Now in Public Preview for GitHub Copilot

Copilot memory is available in public preview for all paid GitHub Copilot plans, offering developers smarter and more context-sensitive assistance. This feature allows Copilot to learn and retain repository-specific information, improving the quality of code suggestions and reviews.

## What Is Copilot Memory?

- **Repository-Specific Knowledge:** Copilot automatically builds a "memory" for each repository as you code, review, or use the Copilot CLI.
- **Scoped and Validated:** Memories are tightly scoped, validated against the current codebase before use, and shared across Copilot features.
- **Automatic Expiry:** Stored memories automatically expire after 28 days to ensure they remain current and relevant.

## How to Use Copilot Memory

- **For Individual Users:** Enable Copilot memory via [personal Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot) (for Copilot Pro/Pro+ plans).
- **For Organizations/Enterprises:** Manage the feature through [organization or enterprise policy settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot).
- **Repository Owners:** Review and manage stored memories under **Repository Settings > Copilot > Memory**, with options to delete as needed.

Learn more from the [engineering blog post](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/building-an-agentic-memory-system-for-github-copilot/) or refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/copilot-memory).

## Key Points

- Copilot memory aims to improve assistance quality by remembering contextually relevant information across Copilot features.
- The system is designed for privacy and data relevance, with automated memory expiration and user review capabilities.
- Discussion and feedback are encouraged in the [GitHub Community announcements](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/announcements).
