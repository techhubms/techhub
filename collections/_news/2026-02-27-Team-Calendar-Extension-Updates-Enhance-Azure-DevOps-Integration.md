# Team Calendar Extension Updates Enhance Azure DevOps Integration

**Author:** Dan Hellem

The Team Calendar extension for Azure DevOps has received a substantial update, introducing a refreshed and consistent design, new capabilities, and enhancements to user experience. Below are the major improvements included in this release:

## Visual and Usability Enhancements

- A modern and consistent design language aligns the extension's appearance with Azure DevOps.
- Smoother transitions for expanding and collapsing UI sections.
- Improved icon clarity and updated color palettes provide better readability and easier distinction between calendar elements.

## Side Panel and Summary Overhaul

- The side panel has been redesigned with a clean UI and can be collapsed to maximize calendar space.
- The Summary View now displays Iterations, Days Off, and Events in organized cards, which are easier to scan and adapt dynamically to screen space.

## Event Organization and Customization

- Events are now categorized, with expandable and collapsible sections that use color indicators for fast recognition and show event counts at a glance.
- Customizable event colors allow adaptation to personal or team preferences.

## Improved Team Management

- Team search makes it easier to find and switch between teams, especially in large organizations.

## Dialog Experience

- Event and days off dialogs benefit from better usability and modern date pickers, streamlining the process of adding or editing calendar entries.

## Summary

Together, these enhancements make the Team Calendar extension a more effective tool for Azure DevOps users. To take advantage of these new features, download and install the Team Calendar extension from the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.team-calendar).
