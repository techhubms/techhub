# GitHub Copilot Knowledge Bases Retiring: Transition to Copilot Spaces

**Effective Date:** September 12, 2025

GitHub Copilot knowledge bases will be officially retired and replaced by [Copilot Spaces](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-05-29-introducing-copilot-spaces-a-new-way-to-work-with-code-and-context/). Copilot Spaces provides a next-generation approach to sharing context with Copilot, aimed at improving answer quality by grounding results in documentation, code, issues, pull requests, and more.

## Who is Impacted?

- All users currently relying on Copilot knowledge bases for custom context management

## What’s Changing?

- **Copilot Spaces Availability:** Anyone with a Copilot account can create Copilot Spaces. Admins need to enable preview policies for Business and Enterprise accounts ([see documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/manage-for-organization/manage-policies#opting-in-to-previews-or-feedback)).
- **Flexible Sharing:** Copilot Spaces may be kept private or shared with organizations, teams, or specific users.
- **Rich Content Integration:** Spaces support adding code, Markdown, JSON, images, file uploads, GitHub issues, and pull requests.
- **Improved Context Management:** Enhanced strategies in Spaces raise the accuracy and relevance of Copilot’s responses.

## Next Steps

- Begin migrating your Copilot knowledge base content to Copilot Spaces before the sunset date.
- Learn how to create and use Copilot Spaces with the [official guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/context/copilot-spaces/creating-and-using-copilot-spaces).
- For questions or assistance, reach out to [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/) or your account team.

Stay ahead by upgrading to Copilot Spaces to ensure continued context-aware AI-assisted development for you and your team.
