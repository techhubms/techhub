Authored by Henry Yan and Sylvie Liu, this post introduces new 24/7, expert-driven protections from Microsoft Defender Experts for protecting cloud workloads, including support for multicloud environments.<!--excerpt_end-->

## Summary

Microsoft has announced expanded coverage in the Defender Experts service suite, providing continuous, expert-driven protection for cloud workloads. These enhancements are designed to address evolving security needs across hybrid and multicloud environments by leveraging Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

### 24/7 Expert-Driven Cloud Protection

Defender Experts now offers around-the-clock protection specifically for cloud workloads. This new capability initially focuses on hybrid and multicloud server environments, utilizing Defender for Cloud to provide comprehensive visibility and threat response across complex infrastructures. With these services, organizations can rely on Microsoft’s expert team to proactively monitor and defend cloud assets against threats.

### Enhanced Incident Detection and Response with Third-Party Signals

Another advancement is the integration of third-party network signals within Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR (Extended Detection and Response). By ingesting and correlating these signals, Defender Experts can provide richer context to security incidents, resulting in faster and more accurate threat detection and response actions.

### Practical Impact

- **Broader Protection**: Organizations operating across hybrid or multicloud infrastructure benefit from consistent, expert-driven security coverage.
- **Accelerated Response**: By leveraging additional network data sources, incidents are identified and remediated more efficiently.
- **Comprehensive Ecosystem**: These updates position Defender Experts as a robust managed security offering for Microsoft-centric cloud and server environments.
