# GitHub Mobile: Model Picker for Copilot Coding Agent

GitHub Mobile has introduced a new feature for Copilot Pro and Pro+ subscribers: the ability to select the AI model used by the Copilot coding agent directly from the mobile app. This enhancement brings more flexibility for developers who want to tailor Copilot’s performance to their current tasks, especially when working on the go.

## Key Features

- **Model Picker:** When starting a Copilot coding agent session in the GitHub Mobile app, users can now choose from several models:
  - Auto (default, lets Copilot optimize for speed and availability)
  - Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5
  - Anthropic Claude Opus 4.6
  - Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5
  - OpenAI GPT-5.1-Codex-Max
  - OpenAI GPT-5.2-Codex

- **User Experience:**
  - Navigate to the Copilot coding agent session in the app
  - Use the model picker interface to select your preferred model
  - Adapt model choice for faster responses (on the go) or more powerful completions (when coding in depth)

- **Availability:**
  - Feature is now live on the latest production builds of GitHub Mobile for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android)
  - Currently available to Copilot Pro and Pro+ subscribers
  - Support for Copilot Business and Enterprise is planned

- **More Information:**
