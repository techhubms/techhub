# The Legacy Copilot Usage Report CSV Is No Longer Available

GitHub has officially retired the legacy Copilot usage report CSV that organization administrators previously accessed under Copilot access settings.

## What’s Changed?

- **Legacy CSV removed:** The old usage report in CSV format is no longer available for download by administrators.
- **In-product notifications:** Admins were notified in advance about this change through in-product messages.

## What Stays the Same?

- **Activity report remains:** The newer Copilot activity report provides all data previously found in the CSV usage report, along with greater detail and enhanced export features.
- **No data loss:** All usage data is still accessible via the new activity report interface and endpoints.

## What Should Admins Do?

- **Update workflows:** If you have existing automations or workflows that depended on the old CSV report, update them to reference the new Copilot activity report endpoints and data formats.
- **Access documentation:** Refer to the [Copilot activity report documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/administer-copilot/download-activity-report) for instructions on downloading and using the new reports.
