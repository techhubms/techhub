# OneLake Catalog: Unified Data Discovery and Governance in Microsoft Fabric

*Author: Microsoft Fabric Blog*

## Introduction

Organizations striving to make data central to everyday decision-making face challenges with fragmented systems and data sprawl. Generative AI further increases the need for high-quality, trusted data. Microsoft Fabric's OneLake catalog addresses these challenges by becoming the unified access point for all enterprise data, supporting secure, governed, and discoverable data usage for analytics and AI workloads.

## Why OneLake Catalog?

OneLake consolidates disparate data sources into a single logical data lake. The OneLake catalog sits on top of this lake, providing discovery, governance, and security capabilities:

- **Discovery:** Enables users to find and understand trusted data fast.
- **Governance:** Ensures data quality, compliance, and proper stewardship with visibility and actionable insights.
- **Security:** Centralizes control of access permissions and enforces security measures.

Over 230,000 organizations have adopted the catalog, supporting large communities of business and technical users—including Power BI and Fabric—ensuring both accessibility and protection for enterprise data.

## Main Features

- **Discovery for All:** Search, filter, and browse all data assets—lakehouses, warehouses, mirrored items, reports, dashboards, and more.
- **Deep Metadata:** View descriptions, tags, schemas, tables, and ownership details.
- **Lineage & Permissions:** Understand where data comes from and who has access—without leaving the catalog.
- **Integration:** Embedded across Microsoft Teams, Excel, Copilot Studio, and more; developers can access catalog data via public APIs, MCP, or CLI, integrating deeply with tools like GitHub Copilot.

### Govern Tab
