# Improved Web Search Capability in GitHub Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot chat on github.com now features model-native web search in select models, improving its ability to answer current events and time-sensitive questions with speed and accuracy.

## What’s New

- **Model-native web search** is now enabled for certain Copilot chat models.
- Where supported, Copilot chat uses the model's built-in web search instead of relying on Bing.
- Other models still use Bing search for web-based answers.

## Eligible Models for Model-Native Search

- GPT-5.1
- GPT-5.1-Codex
- GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini (public preview)
- GPT-5.1-Codex-Max
- GPT-5.2-Codex

## How to Try It

- **Availability:** All paid Copilot subscribers in public preview can access the feature.
- **Enterprise/Organization Setup:** Admins can enable public preview features by opting in via the Copilot settings on github.com.
- **Usage:** Interact with Copilot Chat and ask about current events to leverage model-native search.
- **Opt-out:** Users can disable model-native search in Copilot settings under "Copilot can search the web using model native search".

## Next Steps

The GitHub team plans to gradually expand model-native web search to further models and usage contexts.

Users and organizations are encouraged to join ongoing feedback and discussion with the GitHub community [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/187783).
