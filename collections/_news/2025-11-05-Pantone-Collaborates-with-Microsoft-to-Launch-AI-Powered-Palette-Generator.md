# Pantone Collaborates with Microsoft to Launch AI-Powered Palette Generator

Pantone and Microsoft have partnered to reshape the creative design workflow, announcing the beta release of the Pantone Palette Generator. This new feature in Pantone Connect integrates conversational AI, powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI and associated Azure services, to help designers quickly discover, generate, and analyze color palettes based on trend forecasting and color psychology.

## Key Features

- **Chat-Based Interface**: Designers interact using natural language, asking questions such as "What colors evoke optimism in Gen Z?" to receive palette suggestions rooted in Pantone Color Institute insights.
- **Powered by Azure AI**: Built with Microsoft technologies including Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Azure Cosmos DB, ensuring scalable, secure, and cross-platform delivery.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: The Palette Generator semantically searches Pantone’s proprietary forecasting articles and color research to inform palette generation.
- **Integration with Pantone Connect**: Available within Pantone's digital platform, enabling palettes to be added, shared, and analyzed as part of a collaborative workflow.
- **Current Scope and Future Plans**: Focuses initially on Pantone’s Fashion, Home & Interiors library, with plans to expand to the full Pantone color library and support for upcoming and previous Pantone Colors of the Year.

## Workflow Enhancements for Designers

- Expedites the inspiration and research phases, saving hours normally spent exploring and curating palettes.
- Supports multilanguage use, fortified by the scalability and security measures of Azure services.
- Offers increased efficiency with features like palette downloading, analysis, and sharing, all tailored for collaborative design environments.

## Additional Notes

- The Palette Generator is accessible to all Pantone Connect users during the open beta, including free accounts.
- Pantone continues to enhance its digital ecosystem, such as the Design Mode for Adobe Extension, in response to user feedback.
- Microsoft’s partnership emphasizes how AI can drive productivity and creative innovation across industries, positioning Azure technologies at the core of these advancements.
