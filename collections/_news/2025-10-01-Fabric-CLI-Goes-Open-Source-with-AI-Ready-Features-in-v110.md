Microsoft Fabric Blog introduces the open-sourcing of the Fabric CLI, with author insights on new AI-ready features, developer empowerment, and community-driven roadmap. Discover how v1.1.0 enhances workflows and encourages collaborative innovation.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Fabric CLI: Open Source, AI-Ready, and More Powerful

**Author:** Microsoft Fabric Blog

## Overview

The Fabric CLI has reached an exciting new phase: it is now fully open source. This milestone transforms the CLI from a Microsoft-delivered tool into a platform that thrives on community involvement, making it a flexible and powerful interface for anyone working with Microsoft Fabric. The CLI continues to support both interactive ad-hoc exploration and non-interactive use in automation scenarios like CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Announcements

- **Open Source Release:** The entire Fabric CLI codebase is now open source, allowing developers to extend, audit, and contribute to its direction.
- **AI-Ready:** Version 1.1.0 lays the foundation for AI-assisted contributions—developers can use AI agents to quickly scaffold and refine new commands, tests, and documentation.
- **Improved Workflow Support:** The CLI supports interactive operations for exploration and automation for tasks such as deployments, notebook execution, and more.

## What’s New in Fabric CLI v1.1.0

- **JSON Output:** Generate machine-readable output to integrate with scripts and automation pipelines.
- **Command & Argument Autocomplete:** Enhanced productivity through discoverable commands and reduced errors.
- **Folder Support:** Organize items efficiently with path-like workflows across large Fabric workspaces.
- **Context Persistence:** Navigate into workspaces or folders and keep the context for following commands.
- **Workspace Private Links:** Improve security with private connectivity.
- **AI-Assisted Contributions:** Begin leveraging AI tools to scaffold and contribute features alongside humans.
- **Quality Fixes & Safety:** Community feedback has guided improvements in reliability and safety. See the [Full changelog](http://github.com/microsoft/fabric-cli/releases).

## Why Open Source, and Why Now?

The team open-sourced the Fabric CLI to encourage:

- **Community-Driven Features:** Letting users guide development priorities.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Developers can inspect, harden, and validate the tool.
- **Faster Innovation:** Open extension points enable faster evolution.
- **AI Development Synergy:** AI tooling speeds up prototyping and code quality improvements alongside human contributors.

## Developer Scenarios

- **Interactive Mode:** For ad-hoc exploration, workspace browsing, and development experimentation.
- **Non-Interactive Mode:** For automation in CI/CD, scheduled jobs, notebook-triggered runs, and more.
- **Extension Framework (Planned):** Work is underway on making it easier to build and share CLI add-ons.
- **Embedded Experiences:** Early exploration into making the CLI usable inside editors and web interfaces.

## How to Get Involved

- **Star & Fork the Repo:** Stay updated and experiment locally from [the repo](https://aka.ms/FabricCLI/repo).
- **Contribute:** Issues and pull requests for new features, bugs, docs, or examples are welcome.
- **Promote & Share:** Useful scripts and notebook cells can be proposed as new commands or extensions.
- **Join the Discussion:** Help shape the roadmap and design by providing feedback and review.

## Looking Ahead

The team is committed to ongoing open development, with community and AI-powered innovation at the core. Upcoming plans include an extensions framework, embedded CLI experiences, safer notebook/UDF execution, and richer deployment automation.

> _"Open sourcing the Fabric CLI is just the start. With community insight and AI-assisted contribution, this tool will keep evolving from a fast, intuitive way of working into a platform for custom automation—built together."_
