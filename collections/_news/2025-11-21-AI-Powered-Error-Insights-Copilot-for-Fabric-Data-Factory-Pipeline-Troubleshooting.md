# AI-Powered Error Insights Copilot for Fabric Pipeline Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting data pipeline failures in Microsoft Fabric Data Factory can be daunting—especially when facing dozens or hundreds of errors per run. The new Error Insights Copilot, powered by AI, simplifies and accelerates this process for developers and data engineers.

## Copilot Insights for All Errors in a Pipeline Run

Instead of manually clicking through each error, Copilot provides:

- **Categorized error groups** for better clarity
- **Root cause analysis** for each error category
- **Recommended actions** to quickly fix issues

To utilize Copilot, select the 'error Insights' button within the Pipeline Monitoring or Authoring pages. For example, if a pipeline fails with over 100 errors, Copilot groups them into manageable categories and delivers actionable insights—potentially saving hours of manual investigation.

## Copilot Insights for a Single Activity Error

For error resolution at the activity level, click the Copilot button next to the specific activity. Copilot provides error-specific insights, explanations, and step-by-step recommendations relevant to the particular failure, allowing for focused troubleshooting without interruption from unrelated errors.
