# Enterprise Pull Request Metrics in Copilot Usage Metrics API (Public Preview)

GitHub has expanded the Copilot Usage Metrics API to include detailed pull request–level metrics for enterprise accounts. This allows organizations to track both overall and Copilot-specific pull request creation and review activity, helping engineering leaders monitor AI adoption and workflow engagement.

## What’s New

- **Daily Metrics Now Available**:
  - Total pull requests created
  - Total pull requests reviewed
  - Pull requests created by Copilot
  - Pull requests reviewed by Copilot
- These metrics are available only at the enterprise level and must be accessed through the API.

## How to Enable Copilot Usage Metrics

1. Go to the [Enterprises](https://github.com/settings/enterprises) page in your GitHub settings.
2. Select your enterprise.
3. Navigate to the **AI Controls** tab.
4. In the left sidebar, click **Copilot**, then scroll to **Metrics** to enable the metrics policy.

## Access Requirements

- You need to be an enterprise owner, billing manager, or have a custom enterprise role with the **View Enterprise Copilot Metrics** permission.

## Learn More

## Roadmap
