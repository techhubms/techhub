# Safer Internet Day 2026: Microsoft's Commitment to Responsible AI and Online Safety

As Safer Internet Day 2026 arrives, Microsoft reiterates its guiding principle: safety must be embedded in online services from the ground up. This belief has shaped more than two decades of Microsoft's work, spanning technology solutions like PhotoDNA, investments in responsible gaming, cross-sector partnerships, and educational empowerment for users of all ages.

## Key Highlights

- **Decade of Global Online Safety Survey Research**: With the tenth annual survey, Microsoft has gathered extensive insights into online behaviors, risks, and safety perceptions, interviewing over 130,000 participants in 37 countries. Recent findings indicate rising exposure among teens to hate speech (35%), scams (29%), and cyberbullying (23%), along with increased reporting and resilience.
- **AI Risks and Responsible Innovation**: A significant concern—91% of participants report worrying about AI-related harms. Microsoft's focus on safety-by-design for AI remains central, influencing current and future product and policy approaches.
- **Youth-Centered Initiatives**: Programs like the AI Futures Youth Council and collaborative research with Cyberlite give young people a direct voice in shaping technology’s role and safety features. Workshops across regions have highlighted both AI's benefits (such as offering a judgment-free environment) and perceived risks (privacy, critical thinking challenges).
- **Parental Controls and Family Support**: Microsoft continues to evolve Family Safety features within Windows, responding to regulatory changes and helping parents manage digital consent and safety for teens up to age 18. Guides and resources are provided for effective digital parenting.
- **Xbox Transparency and Inclusive Gaming**: Efforts in the gaming community focus on transparency, empowering caregivers, and maintaining a safe, positive experience for all players. The latest Transparency Report is available for further insight.
- **Minecraft Education’s CyberSafe Series**: The latest world, *CyberSafe: Bad Connection?*, uses immersive gameplay to teach children about online risks, including radicalization and recruitment challenges, representing over 80 million downloads since 2022.
- **Collaboration and AI Literacy**: Partnerships with organizations such as the National 4-H Council support programs on AI literacy and responsible digital habits, emphasizing Microsoft’s multi-faceted investment in community safety.

## Ten Years of Safety Research

Microsoft's Global Online Safety Survey methodology combines annual research since 2016, surveying thousands globally on their digital experiences. This provides critical, region-specific data and supports industry-wide dialogue.

With the digital landscape continually evolving, efforts will remain focused on safeguarding users, especially younger demographics, and upholding transparency and empowerment in all online spheres.
