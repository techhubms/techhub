# What’s New in Copilot Studio: September 2025

## Build Richer Agent Experiences

### Automate UI Tasks with Computer Use

- **Computer use** allows agents to operate apps and websites via virtual mouse and keyboard.
- Now in public preview for U.S.-based environments, supporting secure credential management, allow-list controls, and hosted browser automation via Windows 365.
- Makers can use templates for common workflows and bring Copilot Studio agents into day-to-day human-style navigation tasks.

### WhatsApp Channel General Availability

- Agents can now engage customers directly through WhatsApp, leveraging native integration.
- Supports authentication, interactive attachments, and compliance frameworks.

### Advanced Prompt Builder Features

- **Prompt Evaluations:** Systematic prompt testing (bulk upload/generation, real user data, or manual cases), with results including accuracy scores and case-level insights.
- **Power Fx Support:** Embed dynamic formulas into prompts for context-aware responses—date, text formatting, data lookups, and more.

### Knowledge File Groups

- Makers can create up to 25 file groups (max 12,000 files per agent) as unified knowledge sources.
- Variable-based instructions enable precise, scenario-driven responses.

### Component Collections for Lifecycle Management

- Bundle agent components (topics, actions, knowledge, entities) into reusable, portable collections or whole solutions for streamlined deployment across environments.

### End User File Uploads

- Agents now accept and process file inputs from users, routing them through flows, connectors, or Power Automate for document-centric workflows like summarization or validation.

## Extend and Customize Agents

### Code Interpreter (GA)

- Python actions can now be created, edited, and executed at runtime by agents.
- Prompt builder now supports CRUD operations on Dataverse tables and agent-driven visualizations.
- Code interpreter can be enabled globally or at the prompt level for targeted scenarios.

### Agents Client SDK

- Embeds Copilot Studio agents into Windows, iOS, and Android apps for native conversational experiences; supports text and adaptive card interactions now, with multimodal support on the horizon.

### Simplified MCP Connector Creation

- Connect to MCP servers with minimal manual setup; now in preview with support for various resource types.
- Expands Copilot Studio agent reach and data flexibility.

## Manage and Measure at Scale

### Dedicated Environment for Copilot Studio Lite

- Each Lite agent runs in a dedicated Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat environment, ensuring correct data residency, billing, and easier administrative oversight.

### Detailed Analytics and Reporting

- New metric dashboards: generative AI themes, unanswered question analysis, agent credit limits, and active user tracking.
- ROI calculations for automated agent runs.
- Enhanced capability for makers and admins to monitor, diagnose, and improve agent performance at scale.

## Upskill with the Copilot Studio Agent Academy

- Free curriculum for beginners to advanced makers/developers, organized into Recruit, Operative, and Commander tracks.
