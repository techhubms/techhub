# Announcing the .NET Security Group

*Author: Jamshed Damkewala*

## Introduction

Microsoft’s .NET platform powers diverse workloads across critical sectors, making timely and reliable security updates a necessity. The .NET Security Group is a new initiative designed to strengthen ecosystem security by collaborating with trusted organizations and partners.

## What is the .NET Security Group?

The .NET Security Group consists of organizations that distribute their own versions of .NET. Members receive early (pre-public) access to vulnerability information and source patches. This coordination enables binary packages and patches to be released simultaneously by Microsoft and trusted partners, benefitting the entire .NET community.

- Security updates for .NET are published on a regular monthly schedule (Patch Tuesday).
- Trusted partners, such as Red Hat, Canonical, and IBM, have participated since 2016, allowing for more secure and synchronized patching.

## Why Expand the Group?

The .NET ecosystem includes many third-party distributions. By expanding the group, Microsoft aims to:

- Reduce the time lag between vulnerability disclosure and patched distributions reaching end users
- Make it easier, faster, and more reliable for all .NET users to receive security fixes
- Strengthen secure-by-default frameworks for the global .NET community

## How to Join

Organizations interested in joining must:

1. Complete an [application form](https://aka.ms/DotnetSecurityGroupApplication).
2. Undergo a vetting process to confirm authenticity and compliance with security standards and legal requirements. Vetting includes annual re-evaluation.
3. Receive approval and sign a [program agreement](https://aka.ms/dotnetsecuritygroupagreement), as well as an NDA if necessary.
4. Complete onboarding to begin receiving early security information.

After joining, members will get pre-release information about CVEs in supported .NET versions about a week before public disclosure.

## Conclusion

For organizations distributing .NET, early access to vulnerability details helps streamline patch delivery and enhances security for all users. Apply to join via the [.NET Security Group Application](https://aka.ms/DotnetSecurityGroupApplication).
