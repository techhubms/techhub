# Microsoft Commits to Accelerating Thailand’s AI-Powered Growth and Inclusive Innovation

Microsoft has reaffirmed its dedication to propelling Thailand toward a digital, AI-powered future through a landmark initiative titled "Building Thailand’s AI-Powered Future." This announcement, highlighted by high-level discussions with the Royal Thai Government, brings together multiple sectors to drive innovation, skills, and infrastructure across the country.

## Strategic National Commitment

Microsoft's commitment centers on:

- Building advanced local cloud and AI infrastructure in Thailand
- Creating the Microsoft National AI Innovation Center
- Developing digital and AI literacy for both businesses and the broader developer community
- Supporting inclusive innovation through strong public and private partnerships

## Empowering Thai Enterprises and Public Sector

Several leading Thai organizations are early adopters and partners in this initiative:

- **Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT):** Utilizing Microsoft’s cloud and AI tools to optimize operations, create digital services, and drive sustainable business transformation.
- **KBTG (Tech arm of KASIKORNBANK):** Pursuing a "Human-First x AI-First" transformation by leveraging data and AI to advance decision-making and operational efficiency, focusing on responsible and impactful innovation.
- **SCBX:** Streamlining AI and data workflows to develop conversational banking solutions and improve business performance, using Microsoft's secure and compliant cloud infrastructure.

In collaboration with the Thai government, Microsoft co-developed an **AI Innovation Sandbox** to address national challenges, such as the deployment of an AI solution for the Office of the Council of State (OCS). Built on **Microsoft Azure OpenAI**, this solution is expediting Thailand’s accession to the OECD by automating the review and translation of over 70,000 laws, drastically reducing the time required for complex legal harmonization.

## Building Thailand’s AI Talent

To support a future-ready workforce, Microsoft is:

- Expanding AI skills development initiatives targeting educators, social sector professionals, and skill development centers
- Partnering with government agencies and the private sector to multiply the impact of skilling programs
- Aiming to elevate national AI literacy and prepare Thais for digital economy opportunities

## Infrastructure and Compliance

The creation of a local Microsoft cloud region ensures:

- High-performance, secure, and compliant cloud and AI services
- Support for data residency and international compliance standards
- Empowerment of local businesses and developers to innovate and scale with world-class security and reliability

## Partnerships and Economic Impact

Microsoft is partnering with leading Thai and global enterprises—such as CP Group, True Corporation, True IDC, Gulf Development, and Advanced Info Service—to foster Thailand’s emergence as a regional digital and AI hub and to attract international investment.

## Conclusion

Microsoft’s strategic, long-term engagement positions Thailand at the forefront of AI innovation, delivering tangible value across government, industry, and society through technology, skills, and trusted collaboration.
