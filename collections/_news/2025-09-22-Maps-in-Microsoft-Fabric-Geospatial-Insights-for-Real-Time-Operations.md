# Maps in Microsoft Fabric – Geospatial Insights for Real-Time Operations

## Overview

Microsoft Fabric introduces Maps within its Real-Time Intelligence workload, enabling users to infuse geospatial context directly into their analytics. By integrating Maps, organizations can:

- Visualize where events happen in addition to when they occur
- Combine structured, unstructured, and streaming data for richer insights
- Empower analysts and business users to explore location data without code

## Why Maps in Fabric?

Maps are designed to help organizations shift from reactive to proactive decision-making by:

- **Adding Spatial Context:** Understand and optimize operations with geospatial awareness—key for supply chains, logistics, and business performance.
- **Integrated Experience:** Seamless combination with other Fabric features like Eventhouse (real-time monitoring) and Lakehouse (historical analysis).
- **Accessibility:** No-code map building for data citizens and analysts, enabling widespread adoption and collaboration.

## Use Cases Highlight – Zava's Journey

At FabCon Europe, Zava leveraged Maps in Fabric to unify business intelligence:

- **Global Visualization:** Display worldwide store locations and supply chains using Lakehouse data
- **Revenue Analysis:** Overlay sales by district to identify regional patterns
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Visualize live online order streams from Eventhouse
- **Fleet Tracking:** Monitor delivery routes and vehicles with real-time telemetry
- **In-Store Analytics:** Analyze footfall and dwell time for optimizing store layouts

## How to Build Maps in Fabric

1. **Connect Your Data:** Plug in historical data (Lakehouse) or streaming data (Eventhouse)
2. **Select Layers:** Combine multiple datasets, customize map appearance
3. **Optimize for Scale:** Efficient vector tile creation for large data volumes
4. **Visualize & Explore:** Use clustering, aggregation, and styling tools to discover patterns
5. **Monitor in Real Time:** Watch events unfold live on your maps
6. **Share Solutions:** Distribute map-centric analytics across teams
