# Inside the GitHub Bug Bounty Program: Researcher Insights and Security Advances

**Author:** Shilpa Kumari

GitHub celebrates Cybersecurity Awareness Month by highlighting @dev-bio, a standout participant in its Bug Bounty Program. With the introduction of AI-powered tools such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent), platform security is increasingly vital. The spotlight showcases how researchers like @dev-bio discover and report critical vulnerabilities, contributing to a safer software ecosystem.

## The GitHub Bug Bounty Program

- [GitHub’s Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/) is central to the platform’s security efforts, inviting researchers to uncover vulnerabilities affecting millions of projects.
- GitHub offers a VIP program for top researchers, providing early beta access, direct engagement with engineering teams, and unique rewards.
- More information on the VIP program can be found [here](https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/githubs-revamped-vip-bug-bounty-program/#how-can-one-receive-an-invite).

## AI-Powered Development and Security

- The article emphasizes the growth of AI features such as GitHub Copilot and Copilot coding agent, noting that innovation must be matched by security vigilance.
- Collaboration with experienced security researchers is key to identifying issues in both new AI features and traditional platform functions.

## Researcher Spotlight: @dev-bio

- @dev-bio is recognized for expertise in injection vulnerabilities and software supply chain security.
- Their reports are known for depth and clarity, enabling GitHub's team to assess and respond to threats more effectively.
- @dev-bio discusses entering the bug bounty world, the motivations behind their ongoing participation, and the satisfaction of surfacing real-world impacts from overlooked issues.

## Security Research: Approach and Tools

- @dev-bio prefers developing custom research tools, planning to release a toolkit for mapping GitHub organization risks.
- Methodologies focus on uncovering logical flaws and combining subtle issues into high-impact exploits.
- Research is driven by curiosity, careful documentation, and a commitment to understanding systems at a deep level.

### Top Vulnerability Classes Explored

- Injection attacks
- Logical flaws
- Bypassing content security policies
- Chaining minor bugs into significant threats

## Advice for Aspiring Security Researchers

- Don’t stop at surface-level findings—explore further for hidden impact.
- Study write-ups from the community and engage in hands-on experimentation.
- Keep up with the latest trends and be proactive in researching underexplored areas.
