# Introducing Mistral Large 3 in Microsoft Foundry: Open and Ready for Production Workloads

Explore how Mistral Large 3 expands the Microsoft Foundry ecosystem on Azure by bringing advanced open-source AI capabilities to enterprise organizations.

## Overview

Mistral Large 3 is an Apache-licensed, frontier-class AI model available now on Azure through Microsoft Foundry. It is designed for reliability, transparency, and flexibility in production-scale applications, focusing on long-context reasoning, multimodal understanding, and instruction-following quality.

## Enterprise-ready Open Models in Azure

- **Transparency & Flexibility:** Open-weight models, including Mistral Large 3, offer transparency and adaptability across deployment architectures.
- **Reliable Performance:** Benchmark results focus on real enterprise workflows, with strong instruction adherence and reduced hallucinations.
- **Multimodal Reasoning:** The model supports workflows combining text, images, diagrams, and structured data.

## Capabilities

### Instruction Reliability

- Consistently follows task instructions and provides structured outputs.
- Effective for agents, automation, and business logic integrations requiring predictable behavior.

### Long-Context Comprehension

- Processes and reasons over long documents and multi-step interactions.
- Enables applications in retrieval-augmented generation, document understanding, and multi-turn dialogue.

### Multimodal Reasoning

- Handles text, images, and diagrams simultaneously.
- Ideal for visual question answering, chart interpretation, and cross-modal synthesis.

## Deployment & Licensing

- **Fully Open & Apache 2.0 Licensed**: Global availability outside of regional restrictions; can be fine-tuned or deployed on-premises, in VPC, edge, or sovereign cloud.
- **Integration**: Easily integrated in Microsoft Foundry alongside other open and commercial models.
- **Hybrid and Sovereign Options**: Supports export of weights and custom on-premises setups as licensed by Mistral.

## Microsoft Foundry Features

- **Unified Access**: Centralized workspace for top-performing models (including Mistral Document AI).
- **Observability & Evaluation**: Dashboard and SDK tools for monitoring cost, latency, throughput, and benchmarking across models.
- **Enterprise-grade Safety**: Responsible AI safeguards, compliance, and content filters for production deployments.
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Tool calling for agent-based workflows—powers customer service bots, research agents, and enterprise copilots.

## Use Cases Across Industries

- Enterprise knowledge assistants rooted in long-context comprehension.
- Stable document intelligence and multi-document summarization workflows.
- Developer automation (e.g., code refactoring, test generation).
- Rich customer support experiences using multimodal understanding.

## Model Pricing and Availability

| Model             | Deployment   | Region    | Price/1M Tokens    | Availability        |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Mistral Large 3   | Global Std  | West US 3 | Input: {{CONTENT}}.5 / Output: $1.5 | Dec 2, 2025—public preview |

## The Future of Enterprise Open Models on Azure

Mistral Large 3 sets a new benchmark for production-ready, open-access AI on Azure. Microsoft Foundry unifies frontier and open models under one governance and deployment ecosystem, supporting transparent, flexible, and scalable enterprise workloads.
