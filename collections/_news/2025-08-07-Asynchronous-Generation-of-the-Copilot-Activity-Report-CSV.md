# Asynchronous Generation of the Copilot Activity Report CSV

The process for downloading Copilot activity reports has been enhanced. When an organization admin requests a Copilot activity report, the following improvements now apply:

- **Asynchronous Processing:** Report generation now happens in the background, so admins do not have to wait for the process to complete in real time.
- **Email Notification:** Once the report is ready, the admin receives an email containing a direct download link for the CSV file.
- **Improved Reliability and Scalability:** This change is particularly beneficial for large organizations with extensive Copilot activity data, reducing failures and timeout issues.
- **User Experience:** Admins can request the report and continue with other tasks, streamlining their workflow.
