Microsoft Fabric Blog explains how operations agents in Real-Time Intelligence use AI and ML to automate business monitoring, inference, and action, enabling teams to enhance operational efficiency.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Improving Operational Efficiency with Operations Agents in Fabric Real-Time Intelligence

Agentic systems are AI-powered agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, acting, and learning through continuous feedback loops. Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence provides a platform layer for these agents, allowing them to process signals from diverse sources and operate at scale.

## Key Features and Ignite Updates

- **Fabric Real-Time Intelligence** connects data from time, space, physical, and digital sources, serving as the foundation for agentic solutions.
- The latest Ignite updates introduce autonomous **operations agents** that monitor data, infer goals, recommend actions, and learn from operational feedback.
- These agents utilize continuous monitoring and dynamic goal setting to construct actionable plans.

## How Operations Agents Work

1. **Setup and Configuration**
   - Users define business goals and instructions, choose Eventhouse data sources, and specify available actions via Power Automate integrations.
   - Goals provide context for business processes, while instructions clarify which fields to monitor and what actions to take.

2. **Autonomous Planning**
   - The agent creates a playbook, detailing entities, properties, and monitoring rules rooted in Eventhouse data.
   - It continuously observes for events matching defined conditions.

3. **Reasoning and Action**
   - When relevant conditions are met, the agent evaluates and recommends appropriate actions, submitting its findings and recommendations to users in Teams.
   - Users retain control, validating proposed actions before automation occurs.

## Getting Started

- Enable Copilot/AI and operations agent settings at the tenant level.
- Use a workspace backed by Fabric capacity (trial capacities not supported).
- Find full documentation: [Operations Agent](https://aka.ms/rtiOperationsAgent)
- Share your scenarios or feedback in the [Fabric Community Forums](http://aka.ms/rticommunity).

## Real-World Impact

Operations agents in Fabric Real-Time Intelligence are designed to:

- Automate monitoring and response workflows
- Help organizations reduce risk
- Keep humans informed and involved
- Boost decision-making by embedding real-time AI and ML in business processes
