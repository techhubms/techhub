Mads Kristensen introduces Visual Studio 2026, highlighting a leap in performance, a fresh UI, and the integration of powerful AI features—like native GitHub Copilot support—for developers.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Visual Studio 2026: Faster Performance and AI-Driven Developer Tools Now Available

Visual Studio 2026 has officially been released, marking a significant milestone based on extensive developer feedback and usage. This latest version focuses on delivering a faster, smarter, and more productive experience for developers working across .NET, C#, C++, and more.

## Key Highlights

- **Performance Upgrades**: Visual Studio 2026 boasts blazing-fast startup times, significantly reduced UI hangs (over 50% lower than VS 2022), and an overall more responsive interface—even when working with large, enterprise-scale solutions.
- **Redesigned User Experience**: Enjoy a modernized user interface, improved workflows, more flexible settings, and hundreds of refinements targeting daily developer pain points.
- **AI-Native IDE**: Visual Studio 2026 is billed as the "world’s first Intelligent Developer Environment." AI features are deeply woven into the coding workflow, offering:
  - Integrated debugging and profiling insights
  - Frictionless AI-powered suggestions
  - Seamless integration with GitHub Copilot, now one of the most used features in Visual Studio
  - C# and C++ AI agents to assist with code comprehension and productivity without taking control away from the developer
- **Extension Compatibility and Upgrade Ease**: All extensions compatible with Visual Studio 2022 continue to work in VS 2026, ensuring a smooth upgrade with immediate access to familiar tools and workflows.
- **Automatic Monthly Updates**: The IDE now supports automatic feature and productivity updates, decoupled from critical build toolchains like .NET and C++, allowing developers to stay up-to-date without disrupting toolchain stability.
- **Insiders Channel**: Developers can experiment with preview features through the Insiders Channel, installing it side-by-side with the stable release.

## Improved AI and GitHub Copilot Integration

With this release, GitHub Copilot is tightly integrated into Visual Studio 2026, assisting with code generation, modernization, and even providing new C++ capabilities. Copilot helps accelerate adoption of new features and boosts productivity for developers across languages.

## Productivity and Workflow Enhancements

- Fixes for over 5,000 reported bugs and implementation of 300+ feature requests
- Enhanced support for Mermaid diagrams and modern designing tools
- Compatibility with existing projects and extensions with zero friction
