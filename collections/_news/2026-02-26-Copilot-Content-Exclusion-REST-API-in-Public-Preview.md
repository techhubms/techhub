# Copilot Content Exclusion REST API in Public Preview

Organization and enterprise administrators can now programmatically manage Copilot content exclusion rules using the new Content Exclusion REST API, now available in public preview. This API provides the following capabilities:

- **Content Management**: Automate creation, retrieval, and modification (`GET` and `SET` operations) of Copilot content exclusion rules at both the organization and enterprise levels.
- **Governance and Automation**: Enables easier, large-scale governance of code suggestions by integrating rule management into your workflows and compliance processes.
- **RESTful Interface**: API returns and receives data in JSON format, making integration with existing tooling straightforward.
- **Public Preview**: The API is currently in public preview and may be subject to change based on feedback and further development.
