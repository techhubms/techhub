# Microsoft Expands AI and Cloud Services in Indonesia Central Region

Six months after opening its first cloud region in Indonesia, Microsoft has announced expanded availability of advanced cloud and AI services via the Indonesia Central cloud region. This milestone strengthens Indonesian organizations’ ability to build AI-powered solutions locally.

**Highlights from the Cloud & AI Innovation Summit, Jakarta:**

- Key speakers included Mike Chan (General Manager, Microsoft Asia Azure AI Apps & Agents) and Dharma Simorangkir (President Director, Microsoft Indonesia).

### Next Generation AI and Cloud Services

- New offerings include Azure App Services (for rapid app development), Azure Databases (for secure data management), and advanced AI infrastructure VMs (NVadsA10_v5, NCads_H100_v5) for high-performance ML workloads.
- The Indonesia Central region now hosts these capabilities, enabling organizations to migrate and modernize with local resources.
- Azure OpenAI Service is central for organizations seeking to integrate generative AI into their workflows, demonstrated by tiket.com's in-house AI travel assistant that leverages natural language for customer experience innovations.

### Key Tools for Developers

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot** (business productivity, mentioned but excluded from categories).
- **GitHub Copilot**: Now accessible in Indonesia via cloud region, accelerating developer productivity through AI-driven code generation.
- These are part of a unified Microsoft platform enabling rapid innovation from ideation to production, supported by recent announcements at Microsoft Ignite.

### Microsoft Fabric for Unified Data and Analytics

- Now generally available in Indonesia, Microsoft Fabric provides a full-stack, AI-powered data platform. It integrates Data Lake, Engineering, Integration, Warehousing, Real-time Intelligence, Business Intelligence, and built-in Copilot for seamless data management and analytics.

### Commitment to Innovation Ecosystem

- Microsoft pledges $1.7 billion (2024–2028) for Indonesian cloud, AI infrastructure, ecosystem, and skilling programs.
- Upcoming developer event: GitHub Universe Jakarta (3 December 2025) will gather the region’s developer and startup communities to accelerate AI-led collaboration and innovation. [Register](https://gh.io/recap25-idn).
