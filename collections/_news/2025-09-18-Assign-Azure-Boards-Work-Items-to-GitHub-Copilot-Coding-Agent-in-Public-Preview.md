Allison details the public preview integration of Azure Boards with GitHub Copilot’s coding agent, enabling developers to assign and track work directly through automated background agents.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Assign Azure Boards Work Items to GitHub Copilot Coding Agent in Public Preview

GitHub has launched the Copilot coding agent, an asynchronous, autonomous agent designed to help developers by handling delegated tasks and creating draft pull requests for review. The agent operates in the background, helping streamline the development workflow.

## Key Features

- **Delegation from Multiple Sources:**
  - Developers can hand tasks to Copilot from GitHub Issues, Copilot Chat, the agents panel on every GitHub page, and Raycast.
- **Azure Boards Integration:**
  - Teams using Azure Boards for planning and tracking, and storing code in GitHub, can now assign work items directly to Copilot. Progress can be tracked seamlessly from within Azure Boards.
- **Automated Draft Pull Requests:**
  - When delegated, Copilot works autonomously, creating draft pull requests as part of the code delivery process.

## Getting Started

To get started or sign up for preview access:

- Follow instructions on the [Azure DevOps Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/azure-boards-integration-with-github-copilot-private-preview/).

To learn more about Copilot coding agent:

- Visit the [official documentation](https://gh.io/coding-agent-docs).
- Reference the [GitHub Blog post](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/).

## Value for Teams

- Enhanced collaboration and automation for teams operating across both GitHub and Azure DevOps.
- Simplifies task assignment, tracking, and follow-up, reducing context switching and manual overhead.

## Preview Availability

- The feature is available in public preview. Teams interested in early access should review the blog and documentation for participation steps.
