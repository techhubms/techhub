In this article, Allison discusses the recent update for GitHub Copilot Pro users, introducing the ability to delegate coding tasks to Copilot, which can now run in the background using a new coding agent. <!--excerpt_end--> This feature, currently available in public preview, allows developers on the Copilot Pro plan to hand off tasks to Copilot, freeing up their time to focus on other work. The update aims to enhance developer productivity by leveraging Copilot's AI-powered coding assistance beyond simple code suggestions: it can now take responsibility for more complex or longer-running operations automatically. At launch, access is granted to Copilot Pro subscribers, with mentions of availability for students, teachers, and other specific user groups. This move signals further automation capabilities within GitHub Copilot, catering to evolving developer needs for intelligent, collaborative coding environments.
