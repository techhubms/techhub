# On-Premises Data Gateway December 2025 Release: Manual Update Preview and Power BI Desktop Compatibility

The December 2025 release (version 3000.298) of the on-premises data gateway introduces new features to enhance data integration for enterprise environments.

## New Feature: Manual Update for On-premises Data Gateway (Preview)

- **Manual Updates:** Administrators can now initiate gateway updates on their schedule. Updates can be started directly from the gateway UI or programmatically using an API or script.
- **Maintenance Flexibility:** This option gives organizations control over when and how to update their gateways, improving security and operational predictability.
- **Preview Baseline:** The November 2025 gateway release is the baseline; manual updates are available starting December 2025.
- **Future Direction:** This capability sets the stage for forthcoming fully automatic update support.

For details and step-by-step guidance, see the [Update an on-premises data gateway documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-update?toc=%2Ffabric%2Fdata-factory%2Ftoc.json&bc=fabric%2Fdata-factory%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json).

## Power BI Desktop Compatibility

- The gateway update aligns with the December 2025 release of Power BI Desktop.
- This ensures consistency for report uploads and refreshes via the gateway, matching the execution logic and runtime with the latest Desktop features.
- Refer to the data connectivity section in Power BI’s December 2025 feature summary for connector news.
