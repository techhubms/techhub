# Copilot-Assisted Real-Time Data Exploration in Microsoft Fabric

Microsoft Fabric introduces Copilot-assisted exploration for Real-Time Dashboards, allowing users to seamlessly analyze live data using natural language.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Data Exploration:** Use conversational queries (e.g., “Show me the average temperature by device over the last 30 minutes”) to analyze dashboard tiles or KQL tables.
- **Instant Visual Insights:** Receive immediate, visual answers to queries—no need to write KQL or other query languages.
- **Drill-Through & Save Visuals:** Refine data views, save insights as new dashboard tiles, and share with your team. Saved tiles remain connected to live data, updating automatically.
- **Manual Visual Adjustments:** Options pane lets users fine-tune charts, columns, and formatting to meet their reporting needs.

## Getting Started

1. Open a Real-Time Dashboard in Microsoft Fabric and use the Copilot pane to start querying your data.
2. Use inline Copilot prompts on any tile for interactive exploration.
3. Try Copilot from Real-Time Hub for a broader data view.

### Example Queries

- *Filter by region:* “Which regions have the highest number of delayed orders?”
- *Compare timeframes:* “Compare total sales this month versus last month.”
- *Aggregate by device:* “Show me the average temperature by device over the last 30 minutes.”

## Seamless Insights and Sharing

Once insights are discovered, users can save custom visuals directly to their dashboards. Each visual remains linked to live data, ensuring analytics remain current. Shareable tiles streamline team collaboration and informed decision-making.

## Resources

- For further information, explore the [Explore data in Real-Time Dashboard tiles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2339629) documentation.
