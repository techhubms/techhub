# The Next Chapter of the Microsoft–OpenAI Partnership

Since 2019, Microsoft and OpenAI have collaborated to advance artificial intelligence responsibly and ensure its broad accessibility. This newly announced phase involves a definitive agreement that extends the depth of their partnership and outlines future opportunities.

## Key Agreement Highlights

- **Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)**: Microsoft supports OpenAI's transition to a PBC structure and recapitalization, valued at approximately $135 billion for Microsoft's holding (around 27% ownership on an as-converted diluted basis).
- **Intellectual Property & API Rights**: Microsoft retains exclusive intellectual property (IP) and Azure API exclusivity until AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is declared. Rights extend through 2032 for models and products, including models post-AGI, with built-in safety guardrails.
- **Research IP**: Microsoft's rights to confidential research methods remain until AGI is independently verified or through 2030, whichever comes first. These rights exclude architecture, model weights, inference, fine-tuning code, and relevant data center IP, which remain with Microsoft as non-research IP.
- **Consumer Hardware & Joint Product Development**: Microsoft's IP rights no longer cover OpenAI’s consumer hardware. OpenAI may now jointly develop and launch certain products with third parties; joint API products must remain exclusive to Azure, while non-API products can use any cloud.
- **Independent AGI Pursuit**: Microsoft is now free to pursue AGI alone or with new partners. If using OpenAI’s IP, model compute limits apply until AGI is declared, but thresholds are expanded.
- **Financial Provisions**: Revenue sharing is maintained until AGI is verified, with an adjusted payment timeline. OpenAI is committed to $250B more in Azure purchases; Microsoft loses its previous right of first refusal for further compute contracts.
- **Broader Access and Openness**: OpenAI can provide its APIs to U.S. national security customers regardless of cloud, and may release open-weight models that meet chosen capability levels.

## Strategic Outlook

The agreement ensures that both organizations can continue innovating, building impactful products with a strong focus on responsible development and deployment of AI at industry scale. The restructured partnership sets the foundation for further breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, with Azure as a core platform.
