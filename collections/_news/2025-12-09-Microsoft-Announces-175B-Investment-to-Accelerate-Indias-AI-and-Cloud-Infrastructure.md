# Microsoft Announces $17.5B Investment to Accelerate India's AI and Cloud Infrastructure

Microsoft has announced its largest-ever investment in Asia—$17.5 billion over four years—to drive foundational AI and cloud infrastructure growth in India. Building on a prior $3 billion commitment, this new initiative focuses on three main pillars: scale, skills, and sovereignty.

## Hyperscale Infrastructure Expansion

- Launching India's largest hyperscale cloud region in Hyderabad by mid-2026 (three availability zones).
- Expansion of operational data centers in Chennai, Hyderabad, and Pune enables higher resilience and low-latency performance for enterprises and public sector organizations.
- Secure, sovereign-ready Azure infrastructure aims to support AI adoption at national scale.

## AI Integration in National Platforms

- Advanced AI capabilities are being integrated into e-Shram and the National Career Service (NCS), two Ministry of Labour and Employment platforms built on Azure.
- These efforts will benefit more than 310 million informal workers via multilingual access, AI-driven job matching and analytics, automated resumé creation, and personalized employment pathways.

## Workforce Skilling Initiatives

- Doubling AI skilling commitment: aiming to train 20 million Indians by 2030, via government, industry, and public platforms.
- ADVANTA(I)GE India, executed by Microsoft Elevate, has already trained over 5.6 million people since January 2025, with tangible employment impacts.

## Sovereign Cloud Solutions

- Introduction of Sovereign Public Cloud and Sovereign Private Cloud—delivering secure Azure architectures, compliance and governance controls, and supporting disconnected operations powered by Azure Local.
- Microsoft 365 Local, running on Sovereign Private Cloud, now available to Indian customers.
- Commitment to in-country data processing for Microsoft 365 Copilot by end of 2025, enhancing compliance across regulated sectors.

## Impact and Industry Collaboration

- The investment supports 22,000+ Microsoft employees across Indian cities, enabling AI innovation from infrastructure through product delivery.
- Collaboration with Indian enterprises, developers, and institutions aims to unlock population-scale benefits and accelerate digital transformation on AI platforms including Copilot Studio, Azure AI Search, and Azure Machine Learning.
