# Databricks Runs Best on Azure: Performance, Integration, and AI Synergy

*By Jason Pereira and Anavi Nahar*

Choosing Azure Databricks can streamline your entire data lifecycle within a single, scalable environment. This article demonstrates Azure Databricks' unique advantages over other cloud providers in analytics, integration, performance, and security—distilling why it’s an optimal choice for data and AI workloads.

## Azure Databricks’ Differentiation in Analytics and AI

Azure Databricks stands out as a first-party Microsoft offering, co-engineered by Microsoft and Databricks. While Databricks is available on multiple clouds, Azure Databricks provides:

- **Superior Integration:** Deep connections with Microsoft tools: [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry), [Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partners/bi/power-bi), [Microsoft Purview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/), [Power Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/), [Copilot Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/msft-power-platform), [Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/), [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric), and more.
- **Unified Data Lifecycle:** Manages data engineering, ETL, machine learning, AI, and BI in one environment.
- **Governance and Security:** Enhanced data governance and security capabilities thanks to Microsoft services integration.

## Performance Benchmarking

Independent analysis by Principled Technologies showed Azure Databricks outperformed Databricks on AWS:

- **Up to 21.1% faster** on single query streams
- **More than 9 minutes saved** on four concurrent query streams

This performance means both individual data professionals and teams benefit from faster report generation and analytical processing.

## Autoscale—Balancing Cost and Performance

Azure Databricks offers autoscaling clusters.

- **Autoscaling enabled:** Dynamically adds/removes computing resources as workload intensity varies, optimizing costs.
- **Autoscaling disabled:** For consistent high performance, disables automatic resource adjustment.

Organizations can select the best approach based on their priority—cost savings or consistent speed.

## Azure vs. Other Clouds: Key Feature Comparisons

Azure Databricks distinguishes itself through:

- **Infrastructure:** Optimized for Azure Data Lake Storage; native to the Microsoft platform.
- **Control plane differences:** Provides centralized management, billing, and access control through Azure.
- **Ecosystem integrations:** Native, deep integration with Power BI, Entra ID, Microsoft Fabric, and more.
- **Pricing models:** Azure offers unique billing structures tailored for its ecosystem.

## Azure-Native Features Anchoring Analytics and AI

- **Centralized Billing and Support:** Managed via the Azure portal, unified support by Microsoft and Databricks.
- **Identity and Access:** Microsoft Entra ID and Azure RBAC for seamless authentication and granular security.
- **Azure DevOps Integration:** CI/CD pipelines using Azure Repos and Azure DevOps tools streamline collaboration and deployment.
- **Power BI Automation:** Direct orchestration and publishing of semantic models from Databricks with Unity Catalog for governed data access.
- **Secure Secret Management:** Azure Key Vault integration for managing secrets within Databricks notebooks.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Deep partnerships with Azure Machine Learning for model registry, tracking, and one-click deployments.
- **Confidential Computing:** Protect sensitive workloads using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments.
- **Monitoring:** Centralized insight via Azure Monitor, facilitating a secure, cohesive analytics experience.

## Cross-Cloud Governance

Azure Databricks now enables **cross-cloud data governance**:

- Directly access and manage AWS S3 data with Unity Catalog
- Maintain unified governance and auditing across Azure and AWS
- Standardize security and access policies across hybrid/multicloud environments

## Deep Microsoft Ecosystem Integration: Latest Developments

- **Mirrored Unity Catalog in Microsoft Fabric:** Enables direct Fabric access to Databricks metadata/tables, supporting unified analytics without data duplication.
- **Power Platform Connector:** Connect Power Apps, Power Automate, and Copilot Studio directly to Databricks, supporting real-time enterprise data access for low-code apps and intelligent workflows.
- **Azure AI Foundry Connector:** Use real-time Databricks data in responsible, governed AI applications built with Azure AI Foundry.

## What It Means for Organizations

- **Performance:** Consistently fast analytics for single or multi-user workloads
- **Cost Efficiency:** Flexible autoscaling control to optimize cost or ensure consistent performance
- **Security/Governance:** Robust management, access control, and audit functionality
- **Unified Platform:** Seamlessly integrates advanced analytics, AI, data engineering, and BI with the familiar Microsoft ecosystem
