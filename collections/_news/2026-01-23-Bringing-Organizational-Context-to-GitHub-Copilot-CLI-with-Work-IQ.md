Satya Nadella introduces Work IQ for GitHub Copilot CLI, enabling developers to bring their team's context and organizational knowledge right into their development environment for more effective AI-powered workflows.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Bringing Organizational Context to GitHub Copilot CLI with Work IQ

**Author: Satya Nadella**

So much of software development happens within teams, with essential context stored in documents, emails, meetings, and internal tools like SharePoint. Satya Nadella announces that now, with Work IQ, developers can bring all that work context directly into the GitHub Copilot CLI.

## Unlocking Contextual AI

AI agents often need more context than what is available within a single application. Work IQ solves this by letting you connect organizational data—such as specs in Word, discussions in emails, or decisions from meeting transcripts—to AI-powered developer tools and workflows.

- **How it Works**: Add a single MCP (Microsoft Cloud Platform) server to your agent. The agent seamlessly accesses company data. Developers don’t need to manually summarize specs or hunt for documentation—just ask Copilot to compare implementation with requirements or reconstruct design discussions from past meetings.
- **Powerful AI Actions**: Copilot, with Work IQ, can:
  - Find and analyze Word specs in SharePoint
  - Compare those specs with code implementation
  - Identify which requirements are met, which are drifting, and what’s missing
  - Summarize design decisions by reasoning over past meetings and emails
  - Automatically route to the right AI model per workflow step

## Why This Matters

- **Delegated Execution**: Rather than just giving search results, the agent can perform delegated tasks such as spec-to-code comparison and plan reconstruction.
- **Team Alignment**: Developers can stay in their workflow while accessing the full knowledge base of the organization. This reduces manual effort and makes important context available when making coding decisions.
- **Auditable and Trustworthy**: As team context travels with the work, AI not only boosts productivity but also helps teams audit decisions and understand why certain choices were made.

## Community Reactions

The launch drew insightful reactions from the developer community:

- **Kevin Foo** points out that Work IQ treats work context as a primary input, unlocking new levels of intelligent assistance and making AI more trustworthy in collaborative environments.
- **Dave Senavirathne** stresses that surfacing context at the CLI—where developers actually work—bridges the gap between requirements, decisions, and code.
- **Abhijit Verekar** notes that bringing institutional context to AI agents helps solve long-standing adoption challenges in enterprise and government.
- **Sanjib Rout** emphasizes that shared intelligence leads to better-aligned, decision-aware code.

## Get Started

Developers and teams can try out this integration by accessing the Copilot CLI, enabling Work IQ, and connecting organizational sources. Practical documentation and further discussion can be found in the provided links.

By integrating Work IQ, developer teams turn Copilot into a teammate that understands why decisions are made, not just what code to write.
