# Delegated Bypass Controls for Push Protection Now Available at the Enterprise Level

GitHub has introduced *delegated bypass controls* for push protection in secret scanning, now available at the enterprise level. This gives organizations greater flexibility over who can bypass push protection and how bypass requests are managed and reviewed across all their organizations.

## Key Features

- **Enterprise Scope:** Set up and manage a centralized list of approvers covering all organizations in your GitHub Enterprise account.
- **Delegated Reviewers:** Designate reviewers for bypass requests through Enterprise Security Configuration.
- **Workflow Simplification:** Triage and process all bypass requests in one centralized location under the **Security** tab.
- **API Access:** Set reviewers and manage bypass requests programmatically via the GitHub API.

## How to Use

1. **Configure Reviewers:** Define who can review and approve bypass requests using the Enterprise Security Configuration settings.
2. **Manage Requests:** View and respond to bypass requests directly under the Security tab, or automate handling via the API.
3. **Central Oversight:** Monitor bypass activity and approvals across all organizations under your enterprise for better security governance.
