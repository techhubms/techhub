# Microsoft Announces Fairwater Datacenter: Building an AI Superfactory with Azure

**Author: Satya Nadella**

## Introduction

Microsoft has unveiled the new Fairwater datacenter in Atlanta, linked with the first Fairwater site in Wisconsin and the wider Azure infrastructure. The goal is to establish the world’s first AI superfactory, combining planet-scale compute with purpose-built infrastructure for advanced AI workloads.

## Vision: Unified AI and Cloud Infrastructure

- Fairwater is designed as a 'fungible fleet,' providing flexible resources that can serve any workload, anywhere.
- The unified infrastructure leverages fit-for-purpose accelerators and advanced networking to maximize both performance and efficiency.

## Supporting the Full AI Lifecycle

- Fairwater supports AI workloads beyond pre-training including:
  - Model fine-tuning
  - Reinforcement learning (RL)
  - Synthetic data generation
  - Evaluation pipelines
  - Training and inference

## Datacenter Innovations

- **Max Density**: Two-story design and liquid cooling for high-density GPU clusters. Minimizes cabling, reduces latency, and increases bandwidth.
- **Massive Scale Fleet**: Each datacenter integrates hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs into a cohesive cluster, supporting a broad spectrum of workloads and maximizing GPU utilization.
- Over 100,000 GB300s are coming online to reinforce inference capacity across the fleet.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Emphasis on maximizing the number of 'useful tokens' per gigawatt—delivering not just raw scale, but optimized throughput and sustainability.

## Planet-Scale Elasticity

- Fairwater datacenters connect via a continent-spanning AI WAN to prior generations of Azure AI supercomputers.
- Developers can dynamically scale workloads beyond a single location, landing compute where needed for seamless scaling and flexibility.
- Different generations of silicon and systems are unified, creating a single, elastic pool available for both training and inference.

## Integration with Azure Cloud Services

- AI capacity is delivered alongside broader Azure offerings like:
  - Compute
  - Storage
  - Databases
  - Application services
- Enables AI agents and applications to access the full power of Azure’s cloud for vertical and horizontal scaling.

## Performance, Sustainability, and Future Vision

- Focus on performance per watt and per dollar, advancing both energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
- Platform is positioned to empower developers and businesses with elastic, high-performance AI resources, while enabling sustainable growth of AI at global scale.
