# Microsoft Leads Gartner 2025 Email Security Quadrant with Defender for Office 365 and Agentic AI

## Recognition in Gartner's Email Security Quadrant

Microsoft has been named a Leader in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Email Security, underscoring the value and effectiveness of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 in the face of today's sophisticated email threats.

## Evolving Email Threats and AI-Driven Defenses

- Email remains a primary vector for cyberattacks.
- Attackers now use AI to automate, amplify, and evolve attack strategies, making detection more challenging.
- Business Email Compromise (BEC) is transitioning into a more professional, service-driven type of crime, according to the recent [Microsoft Digital Defense Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/threat-landscape/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025).

## Innovations in Defender for Office 365

- **Agentic Email Grading**: Defender for Office 365 uses agentic AI and language models to rapidly analyze user-submitted phishing emails. This system delivers fast verdicts with context and continuous improvement via feedback loops.
- **Security Copilot: Phishing Triage Agent**: Automates classification and triage of phishing alerts, reducing manual workload for SOC teams, resolving false positives autonomously, and escalating true threats. Microsoft reports a 40% faster resolution rate in early deployments.
- **Email Bombing Protection**: AI tracks message volumes and sender patterns, proactively moving suspected email bombs to junk, maintaining inbox integrity.

## Expanding Transparency and Benchmarking

- Microsoft provides in-product transparency reports, granting customers visibility on security outcomes.
- Released benchmarking reports comparing Defender for Office 365 against Secure Email Gateway (SEG) and Integrated Cloud Email Security (ICES) solutions, using real-world threats rather than artificial tests.

## Future Directions

- Increased investment in agentic AI to boost autonomous security operations.
- Expansion of coverage to platforms beyond email, including Microsoft Teams and deepfake detection.
- Roadmap focuses on practical challenges for security teams: speeding up detection, maintaining effective protection, and supporting smarter responses.
