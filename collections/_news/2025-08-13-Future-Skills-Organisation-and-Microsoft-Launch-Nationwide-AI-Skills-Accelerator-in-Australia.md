- **Scalable Model:** The 12-month pilot will test scalable, sustainable methods for industry-education collaboration.
- **Alignment with Industry Needs:** Focus on peer learning, resource sharing, and direct engagement between industry and training institutions.

## National and Industry Support

The program is backed by the Australian Government and has support from a cross-section of industry and training stakeholders such as TAFE QLD, TAFE SA, Commonwealth Bank, Adobe, National AI Centre, and more. Government officials and sector leaders have highlighted the program’s role in future-proofing Australia’s workforce and aligning training with the demands of an AI-driven economy.

## Program Features
