# Simplifying Data Ingestion with Copy Job: More File Formats and Enhancements

Copy job in Microsoft Fabric Data Factory serves as a versatile tool for moving data across clouds, on-premises systems, and services. With its intuitive interface and support for bulk copy, incremental copy, and change data capture (CDC) replication, Copy job enables a wide array of data movement scenarios suited for modern data engineering workflows.

## Expanded File Format Support

**Copy job** now includes native support for the following additional file formats:

- **ORC**
- **Excel**
- **Avro**
- **XML**

This enhancement empowers users to ingest and distribute data from a variety of structured and semi-structured sources, increasing compatibility and flexibility depending on analytical or business needs.

## Enhanced CSV Configuration Options

Working with CSV data is now more robust, thanks to new settings:

- **Quote Character** — Configure how quoted text is parsed.
- **Escape Character** — Handle embedded delimiters and quotes for accurate parsing.
- **Encoding Options** — Select from UTF-8, UTF-16, or regional encodings like BIG5, GB18030, and SHIFT-JIS, streamlining integration between global data sources/destinations.

These controls ensure precise parsing, data fidelity, and compatibility across diverse workflows.

## Key Capabilities

- Move data efficiently regardless of the source or target format
- Seamless handling of new and legacy file types
- Flexible CSV ingestion for global or complex data sources
- Maintain robust data pipelines between on-prem, cloud, and hybrid environments
