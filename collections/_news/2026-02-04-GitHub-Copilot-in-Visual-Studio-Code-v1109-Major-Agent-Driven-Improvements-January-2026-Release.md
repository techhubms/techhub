# GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code v1.109 – January 2026 Release

The January 2026 release of GitHub Copilot brings major updates and new capabilities for users of Visual Studio Code, focusing on agent-driven development, advanced customization, and developer-centric improvements.

## Key Highlights

### Agent Extensibility and Integrations

- **Claude agent support (public preview):** Developers can now delegate tasks to Anthropic’s Claude Agent SDK, utilizing Claude models directly from their Copilot subscription inside VS Code.
- **Richer chat with MCP apps:** Enables more interactive and tool-driven Copilot experiences within the editor.

### Copilot Chat and UX Enhancements

- **Snappier chats:** Enhanced streaming makes responses more immediate.
- **Better reasoning:** Improved result quality allows more reliable and accurate Copilot-generated code or answers.
- **Transparent agent logic:** Features like thinking tokens give insight into Copilot's reasoning steps, and agents now ask clarifying questions when uncertain.
- **Revamped inline chat:** More natural, context-aware interactions while coding.

### Multiagent Development & Session Management

- **Improved session management:** Easily delegate work across Copilot, Claude, local, background, and cloud agents.
- **Handoff and intervention:** Seamlessly take over tasks from any agent as needed, maintaining development momentum.
- **Agent indicators:** Notification for sessions needing attention; subagents can run parallel tasks for faster completion.

### Agent Customization and Orchestration

- **Orchestration:** Build and automate custom agent workflows suited to your team or project.
- **Agent Skills & org-wide customization:** Uniform outcomes and enhanced consistency across environments.

### Agent Optimizations

- **Copilot Memory:** Agents learn and retain relevant context to improve future interactions.
- **External code search:** Faster indexing supports efficient large-repository development.

### Security and Trust Improvements

- **Terminal command sandboxing:** Experiments with safer command execution (currently for macOS/Linux).
- **Auto-approval rules:** Reduces unnecessary prompts while tightening control of agent actions.
- **Terminal lifecycle management:** Better process control with timeouts, async awaiting, and kill features.

## Related Visual Studio Code Productivity Updates

- **Integrated browser:** Run and test applications without leaving the code editor.
- **Enhanced terminal:** Additional improvements for smoother workflow and reliability.
- **Coding/editor refinements:** Quality-of-life updates that streamline daily programming activities.
- **Extension & API enhancements:** More options for extension authors, enabling advanced development experiences.
