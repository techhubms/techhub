**Author:** Allison  
**Date:** February 19, 2026  

GitHub has announced that the following AI models are now deprecated across all GitHub Copilot experiences, effective February 17, 2026:

| Model           | Deprecation Date | Suggested Alternative   |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Claude Opus 4.1 | 2026-02-17       | Claude Opus 4.6        |
| GPT-5           | 2026-02-17       | GPT-5.2                |

This affects Copilot Chat, inline edits, ask and agent modes, and code completions.

## Steps for Users and Administrators
