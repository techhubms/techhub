# Global technology leaders launch Trusted Tech Alliance

**MUNICH — Feb. 13, 2026**

At the Munich Security Conference, 15 technology companies—including Microsoft, Amazon, Google Cloud, Anthropic, Ericsson, SAP, Nokia, and others—announced the formation of the Trusted Tech Alliance (TTA). This global consortium aims to foster a trusted technology stack, spanning connectivity, cloud infrastructure, semiconductors, software, and AI, based on a unified set of ethical and operational principles.

## Purpose and Principles

The Alliance intends to address challenges arising from the rapid technological evolution and the resulting demands for reliability, resilience, and public trust. Member companies agree to abide by five key principles:

1. **Transparent Corporate Governance and Ethical Conduct**
2. **Operational Transparency, Secure Development and Independent Assessment**
3. **Robust Supply Chain and Security Oversight**
4. **Open, Cooperative, Inclusive, and Resilient Digital Ecosystem**
5. **Respect for the Rule of Law and Data Protection**

Participants are committed to:

- Corporate responsibility and governance
- Secure technology development and continuous management
- Enforcing strong contractual guarantees throughout their supply chain
- Promoting openness and innovation in the digital economy
- Upholding global data protection standards

## Collaboration and Impact

TTA's formation is a response to increased skepticism about digital technologies and the need for cross-border trust. The initiative is open to other providers committed to these shared standards, aiming to further economic growth and societal progress by ensuring technology is safe, resilient, and transparently operated.

## Notable Member Statements

Leaders from participating companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, Anthropic, and Google Cloud, highlighted the necessity of collaboration in earning and maintaining customer trust, as well as the need for secure, transparent, and interoperable systems, especially in the era of rapidly advancing AI and digital infrastructure.
