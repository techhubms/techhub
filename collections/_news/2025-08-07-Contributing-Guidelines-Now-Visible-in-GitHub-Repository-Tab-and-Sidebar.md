# Contributing Guidelines Now Visible in Repository Tab and Sidebar

**Author: Allison**

## Overview

GitHub has updated its interface to make contributing guidelines much easier to find for all repository users. Previously, new contributors often struggled to locate detailed instructions for contributing because the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file was not always prominently displayed. This update enhances onboarding and lowers barriers for community members to participate in open source projects.

## What Has Changed

- **Repository Overview Tab:** A new **Contributing** tab now appears alongside the **README** and **Code of conduct** tabs at the top of the repository overview whenever a repository contains a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- **Repository Sidebar:** A dedicated **Contributing** link is also shown in the repository sidebar, offering another quick access point to guidelines.

These features mean contributors no longer need to search for guidelines within the repository’s file structure—they can quickly access instructions from two highly visible areas.

## Impact

- **Faster Contributor Onboarding:** New contributors can immediately access instructions, reducing confusion and effort involved in getting started.
- **Community Growth:** Lowering the barrier to entry supports a more welcoming and active open source community.
- **Streamlined Processes:** Maintainers can more easily direct contributors to guidelines, increasing consistency for code submissions and issue reporting.

## Feedback

GitHub invites community feedback regarding this change. Users can share their experiences or report issues in the [Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/169061).
