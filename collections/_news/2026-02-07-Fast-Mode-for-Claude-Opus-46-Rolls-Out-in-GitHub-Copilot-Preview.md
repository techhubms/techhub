# Fast Mode for Claude Opus 4.6 Rolls Out in GitHub Copilot Preview

**Author: Allison**

GitHub Copilot is introducing a research preview of 'Fast mode' for Claude Opus 4.6, available to Copilot Enterprise users. This experimental release focuses on delivering output token speeds up to 2.5x faster while maintaining the intelligence and feature set of the original Opus 4.6 model.

## Key Highlights

- **Faster Output Speeds:** Fast mode significantly reduces inference time, providing a smoother and more responsive developer experience.
- **Feature Parity:** Maintains the same capabilities and intelligence level as standard Opus 4.6.
- **Enterprise Availability:** The fast mode is initially accessible to Copilot Enterprise plan users.
- **IDE Integration:** Users can select Claude Opus 4.6 Fast mode within Visual Studio Code (across chat, ask, edit, and agent modes) and through Copilot CLI.
- **Gradual Rollout:** The feature is rolling out progressively; availability may vary, and users are encouraged to check back if it is not immediately accessible.

## Enabling Fast Mode

Copilot Enterprise administrators must enable the Fast mode policy for Claude Opus 4.6 in Copilot's admin settings. Once enabled, developers can pick the new model in their preferred environment.
