# Microsoft and OpenAI Affirm Ongoing Strategic AI Partnership

Since 2019, Microsoft and OpenAI have collaborated to advance artificial intelligence responsibly and make its benefits widely accessible. This joint statement underscores their enduring partnership, grounded in trust, deep technical integration, and a shared commitment to innovation.

## Key Points from the Statement

- **Partnership Strength**: The relationship remains strong and central to both companies' AI visions. New funding and announcements do not alter the partnership's foundational terms.
- **Intellectual Property**: Microsoft retains exclusive licensing and access to OpenAI's models and products. Collaborations between OpenAI and other partners, such as Amazon, were anticipated under previous agreements.
- **Commercial Arrangements**: Revenue sharing agreements are unchanged, encompassing revenues from partnerships involving other cloud providers.
- **Azure as Exclusive Cloud Provider**: Azure remains the sole provider for stateless OpenAI APIs, benefiting customers with global reach, security, and enterprise capabilities. Even when OpenAI partners with third parties, stateless API calls are hosted on Azure.
- **Product Hosting**: OpenAI's core offerings, including Frontier, continue to be hosted on Azure.
- **AGI Considerations**: Definitions and evaluation processes for artificial general intelligence (AGI) remain unchanged.
- **Support for Growth**: The partnership allows both companies independence and supports OpenAI's expansion efforts, including initiatives like Stargate.

## Ongoing Commitment

Microsoft and OpenAI reaffirm their dedication to working side by side, focusing on the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. Both remain committed to ensuring AI delivers broad benefits for organizations and society.
