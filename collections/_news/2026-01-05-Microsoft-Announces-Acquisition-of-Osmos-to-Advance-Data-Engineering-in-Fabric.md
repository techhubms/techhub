stclarke reports on Microsoft's acquisition of Osmos, an AI-driven data engineering platform, to enhance autonomous data workflows and analytics within Microsoft Fabric.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Microsoft Announces Acquisition of Osmos to Advance Data Engineering in Fabric

Today, Microsoft announced the acquisition of Osmos, an agentic AI data engineering platform designed to simplify and accelerate complex data workflows.

## Microsoft + Osmos: Advancing Autonomous Data Engineering in Fabric

Organizations continue to struggle with disparate data sources and manual data preparation. Osmos applies agentic AI to convert raw data into analytics- and AI-ready assets directly in OneLake, the unified data lake powering Microsoft Fabric.

This acquisition furthers Microsoft Fabric’s mission to provide a single, secure platform where users can unify, prepare, analyze, and share all organizational data. By integrating Osmos, Microsoft envisions a future where autonomous AI agents seamlessly collaborate with people, reducing operational overhead and facilitating faster, easier data integration and analysis.

## Empowering Organizations to Unlock Value from Data

The Osmos team will join Microsoft’s Fabric engineering group to realize simpler, intuitive, and AI-powered data experiences. This integration will deliver:

- Streamlined data preparation using AI and automation
- Faster transitions from raw data to analytics-ready assets
- Deep integration with Fabric’s OneLake infrastructure
- Enhanced support for AI-powered analytics and enterprise data needs
