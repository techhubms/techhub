# Start and Track Copilot Coding Agent Tasks in GitHub Mobile

With GitHub Copilot coding agent on GitHub Mobile, developers can now delegate coding tasks to Copilot, letting it work in the background while they are on the go.

## What's New?

### Start New Coding Tasks from Your Mobile Device

- Initiate a new Copilot coding agent task directly from the **Home** or **Repository** view in the GitHub Mobile app.
- Tap the **+** button, choose your repository, and describe the coding task in a prompt.
- Copilot automatically creates a draft pull request, works on the task in the background, and tags you for review when ready.
- If push notifications are enabled, you’ll be notified as soon as the draft is available.

### Track All Copilot Coding Agent Tasks

- Access all active coding agent tasks via the new **Agents** section under **My Work** on the app's Home screen.
- Get a centralized dashboard for the status of every Copilot agent task, making it easy to stay updated and manage work remotely.

## Developer Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Delegate repository tasks from anywhere using your mobile device.
- **Productivity**: Stay informed of agent progress without needing a full desktop environment.
- **Visibility**: Easily manage and review tasks with a dedicated Agents dashboard.
