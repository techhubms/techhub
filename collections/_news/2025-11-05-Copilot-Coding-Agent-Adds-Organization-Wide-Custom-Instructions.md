# Copilot Coding Agent Adds Organization-Wide Custom Instructions

The Copilot coding agent, GitHub's asynchronous and autonomous background agent for code-related tasks, now supports organization custom instructions. This feature empowers development teams to establish guidelines for how Copilot understands projects and automates critical workflows, such as building, testing, and validating code changes.

## Key Features

- **Organization Custom Instructions:**
  - Administrators can now set default custom instructions, ensuring that all Copilot coding agent operations across the organization follow a consistent approach.
  - Custom instructions influence how Copilot interprets projects and manages the software development lifecycle steps it automates.

- **Supported Instruction Formats:**
  - The agent supports configuration through files like:
    - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
    - `.github/instructions/**.instructions.md`
    - `AGENTS.md`
    - `CLAUDE.md`
    - `GEMINI.md`

- **Consistency Across Teams:**
  - By defining organizational defaults, teams can maintain shared standards and reduce ambiguity in Copilot-driven work.
