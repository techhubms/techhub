# Copilot Coding Agent Now Supports Pull Request Templates

GitHub's Copilot coding agent has introduced a new feature that enhances automated development workflows. The coding agent, designed as an asynchronous and autonomous assistant, now updates its pull request bodies according to the repository's pull request templates.

## Key Update

- **Template Integration**: When Copilot coding agent finishes its work, it now follows the repository’s existing pull request templates when summarizing and submitting changes.
- **Multiple Templates**: If your repository contains multiple pull request templates (`pull_request_template.md` files), Copilot will automatically select the one that best fits the context of the pull request.

## How to Enable

- Add a `pull_request_template.md` file to your GitHub repository.
- For multiple templates, Copilot will decide which template is the most relevant for each task based on its evaluation.

## Additional Resources

- [Creating a pull request template](https://docs.github.com/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)
- [Copilot coding agent documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/coding-agent/about-coding-agent)

This improvement helps standardize change summaries and streamlines collaboration for automated contributions. Review best practices in the official documentation to maximize the effectiveness of Copilot in your development workflow.
