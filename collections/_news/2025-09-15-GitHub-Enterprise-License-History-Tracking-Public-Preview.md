# GitHub Enterprise License History Tracking Now in Public Preview

GitHub Enterprise administrators now have access to a license usage tracking feature that delivers:

- **Daily Snapshots**: Track additions and removals of licenses each day.
- **Action Details**: See which actors added or removed licenses and on what date.
- **Billing Clarity**: Identify when license changes start impacting monthly billing.

## Feature Availability

- Available for **metered GitHub Enterprise Cloud accounts** without Visual Studio bundles.
- Find your license history by navigating to:
  - **Enterprise > Billing and licensing > Licensing > GitHub Enterprise Cloud > Manage**

## Why It Matters

- **Improved Visibility**: Administrators and billing managers gain granular insights into how licenses are used over time, helping with audits, budget planning, and compliance.
- **Transparent Billing**: The effective date of license changes is shown, so teams know when adjustments affect invoices.
- **Action Attribution**: Knowing who made license changes adds accountability for enterprise environments.
