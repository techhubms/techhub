# Microsoft Cost Management Updates—July & August 2025

Microsoft Cost Management helps organizations of all sizes monitor, analyze, and optimize their Azure spending, reducing the risk of surprise cloud bills and supporting better financial planning.

## Key July & August 2025 Highlights

- **Service Principal Support for Partner Admin Reader Role**: Partners can now assign the Partner Admin Reader role to service principals, enabling secure, programmatic access to cost data for customers managed under Enterprise Agreements. This eliminates the need for manual exports or shared credentials and leverages Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) for secure access.
  - Automate cost data retrieval for partner billing and dashboards
  - Control billing scope access with Azure RBAC
  - Enable near real-time monitoring across customers

- **New Cost-Saving Features**:
  - [Azure Firewall Ingestion-Time Transformation](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=498568): Transform or filter firewall logs before ingestion for reduced Log Analytics storage costs while retaining security insights.
  - [Azure Storage Mover for S3-to-Azure Blob Migration](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates?id=497461): Securely migrate data from Amazon S3 to Azure Blob at no additional cost, simplifying multi-cloud and migration scenarios.
