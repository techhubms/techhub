# Microsoft Sovereign Cloud Enables Disconnected Operations for Secure AI and Cloud Workloads

As digital sovereignty takes center stage for organizations facing strict regulatory and risk environments, Microsoft introduces robust enhancements to its Sovereign Cloud offerings. The latest updates enable enterprises, the public sector, and regulated industries to operate with full autonomy, keeping critical workloads including advanced AI models secure and resilient—even when completely offline.

## Key Announcements

### Azure Local Disconnected Operations

- **Run mission-critical Azure workloads without cloud connectivity.**
- Provides Azure governance and policy control locally for sovereign, classified, or isolated environments.
- Supports scalability from small deployments up to data-intensive and AI-driven operations.
- Management, policy, and workload execution remain within the customer’s own infrastructure, ensuring continuous operation under strict sovereignty or in the absence of network access.
- Enables familiar Azure experiences without dependency on the global public cloud.

### Microsoft 365 Local Disconnected

- **Core productivity workloads (Exchange Server, SharePoint Server, Skype for Business Server) run on-premises** within a sovereign operational boundary.
- Teams remain productive and collaborative even when disconnected from the cloud.
- All workloads run locally under customer-owned policies, ensuring data resiliency and compliance.
- Azure-consistent management and governance for productivity services.
- Supported through at least 2035.

### Foundry Local: Modern Infrastructure for Large AI Models

- **Enables organizations to run large, multimodal AI models in fully disconnected, secure, on-premises environments.**
- Supports the latest GPU hardware from partners such as NVIDIA.
- Localized AI inferencing and APIs operate within strictly controlled sovereign boundaries.
- Comprehensive Microsoft support for deployment, updates, and operational health.

## Unified Sovereign Private Cloud Architecture

- **Sovereign Private Cloud** unifies Azure Local, Microsoft 365 Local, and Foundry Local as a single operational stack.
- Organizations can choose between cloud-connected, hybrid, or fully disconnected deployment models based on their mission, risk, and regulatory requirements.
- Provides a resilient, full-stack experience for infrastructure, productivity, and AI workloads—independent of external connectivity.
- Simplifies governance and policy enforcement, with all operations remaining within customer-controlled environments.

## Security and Governance Focus

- Data, identities, and operations stay inside sovereign boundaries, meeting the needs of sectors with the highest privacy, security, or regulatory demands.
- Organizations retain full control without compromising operational continuity, resilience, or technical capabilities.

## Customer Perspective

> "The availability of Azure Local disconnected operations represents a breakthrough for organizations that need control over their data without sacrificing the power of the Microsoft Cloud. For Luxembourg, where digital sovereignty is not just a principle but a strategic necessity, this model offers the resilience, autonomy and trust our market expects." — Gerard Hoffmann, CEO Proximus Luxembourg
