# Building Agentic Apps with the GitHub Copilot SDK: New Developer Paradigms

A new era is unfolding in software development. The agentic execution loop is fast becoming the heart of modern applications, shifting the developer workflow away from linear prompts toward multi-step, autonomous orchestration.

## What Is an Agentic Execution Loop?

Instead of traditional, single-step code execution models, agentic systems can plan, reason, call tools, and iterate until a task is fulfilled. This unlocks:

- **Multi-step planning and execution**
- **Integrated tool use** (tool calling, orchestration)
- **Autonomous workflows** with decision-making

## The GitHub Copilot SDK

With the production-tested runtime behind Copilot CLI, the [GitHub Copilot SDK](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/build-an-agent-into-any-app-with-the-github-copilot-sdk/) enables:

- Multi-model support
- Advanced multi-step workflow orchestration
- Seamless integration with the Microsoft Copilot Platform (MCP)
- Secure authentication
- Streaming capabilities

These features can now be embedded directly into your applications, elevating them with:

- Autonomous agent behaviors as a core feature (not just an add-on)
- Scalable, production-ready runtime components
- Tool, data, and collaboration integration at the workflow layer

## Developer and Product Benefits

- **Standardizes agentic workflows**: Eliminate the need to build custom runtimes.
- **Accelerates feedback and iteration** cycles for app builders.
- **Up-levels developer experience** beyond code to intent-driven logic flows.
- **Future-proofs applications** by building on robust, ecosystem-supported foundations.

## Community Insight

Comments from industry leaders and developers highlight:

- The shift from syntax-driven to intent-driven development
- The need for governance, provenance, and audit layers as agents scale
- Early validation and user feedback for AI-driven product workflows
