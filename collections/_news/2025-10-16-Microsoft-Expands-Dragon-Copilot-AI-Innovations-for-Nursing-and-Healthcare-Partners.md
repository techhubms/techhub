# Microsoft Expands Dragon Copilot AI Innovations for Nursing and Healthcare Partners

Microsoft has unveiled major updates to Dragon Copilot, its ambient and generative AI-enabled clinical assistant, with a focus on enhancing workflow efficiency and patient care quality for nurses and healthcare organizations.

## Key Highlights

- **Ambient Experience for Nurses:**
  - Dragon Copilot introduces the first commercially available AI-powered ambient solution optimized for nursing workflows.
  - Nurses can now leverage AI for streamlined clinical documentation, automated routine tasks, and access to trusted medical content within their native workflow.
  - Features include real-time capture and transformation of nurse-patient conversations into Electronic Health Record (EHR) documentation, the ability to preview and edit captured notes, and inline access to organizational guidance.

- **Partner Extensibility:**
  - Healthcare partners can develop and securely integrate AI apps and agents directly into Dragon Copilot, allowing clinicians to access specialized tools without leaving their workflow.
  - Partners contributing capabilities include Elsevier, OpenEvidence, Wolters Kluwer UpToDate (for clinical content), Atropos Health (clinical decision support), Canary Speech (vocal biomarker analysis), Lightbeam Health Solutions, Pangaea Data, Ensemble, Regard, Cohere Health, Humata Health, Rhyme, RhythmX AI, Artisight, and hellocare.ai.

- **Revenue Cycle Management & Patient Experience:**
  - New applications streamline administrative processes such as revenue management, prior authorizations, and care economics, helping healthcare organizations boost efficiency and improve patient experiences.

- **Smart Hospital & Virtual Care Integrations:**
  - Voice and contextual data from smart hospital and virtual care platforms can be converted into documentation compatible with Dragon Copilot workflows.

- **Industry Partnerships and Adoption:**
  - Early adopters like Baptist Health are piloting ambient AI features including solutions from Canary Speech, demonstrating real-world workflow integration.
  - Microsoft’s commitment to partnership-driven innovation is seen in the integration of a healthcare agent service through Copilot Studio, maintaining reliability and clinical safeguards for generative AI outputs.

- **Addressing Nurse Burnout:**
  - With nurse burnout on the rise, the AI-powered ambient experience is designed to lower administrative burdens by automating documentation, surfacing vital information, and creating time for direct patient care.
  - The solutions reflect multi-year collaboration between Microsoft and nursing leaders to ensure relevance and adoption.
