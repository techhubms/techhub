# Copilot SDK Technical Preview: Multi-Language Access to GitHub Copilot CLI

The Copilot SDK is now available as a technical preview, making it possible for developers to programmatically access and extend the GitHub Copilot CLI through language-specific SDKs.

- **Python**: `copilot`
- **Go**: `github.com/github/copilot-cli-sdk-go`
