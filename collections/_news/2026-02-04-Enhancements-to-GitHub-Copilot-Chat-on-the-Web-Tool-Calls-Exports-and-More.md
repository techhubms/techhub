# Enhancements to GitHub Copilot Chat on the Web: Tool Calls, Exports, and More

GitHub has announced several new features and updates designed to make the Copilot Chat experience on github.com smoother and more transparent for developers.

## Tool Calls in Chat Responses

When interacting with Copilot Chat, users will now see detailed 'tool call' information within their responses. This upgrade enables you to:

- Track the actions Copilot is taking to address your request
- Identify and address issues if steps fail mid-process
- View references generated from each tool call, increasing transparency

## Export Chats to JSON or Markdown

Developers can now export Copilot Chat conversations for later reference. To export a chat:

1. Select the conversation you wish to save.
2. Click the 'more' menu (Manage chat) and choose **Export**.
3. Pick either JSON or Markdown as your export format.

This feature makes it easier to archive problem-solving sessions or share insights with your team.

## Improved Repository Attachments

Searching for and attaching repositories to Copilot Chat is now faster and more accurate. The enhanced recommendation engine surfaces better suggestions, making it simpler to connect the right repository during your interactions.

## Get Involved

GitHub encourages user feedback and suggestions. Join the ongoing discussion within the [GitHub Community](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186360) to share your experiences or ideas for further improvements to Copilot Chat on the web.
