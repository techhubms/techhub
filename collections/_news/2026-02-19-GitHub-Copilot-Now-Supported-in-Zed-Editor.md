# GitHub Copilot Now Supported in Zed Editor

GitHub has officially announced that all Copilot paid subscriptions—Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise—are now fully supported in the Zed code editor. Developers can authenticate with Zed using their existing Copilot credentials to access Copilot's AI-assisted coding features, bringing Copilot's productivity enhancements directly into Zed as part of a formal partnership.

## What is Zed?

Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor built in Rust by the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter. It is designed for speed, team collaboration, and extensibility. More information about Zed can be found at [zed.dev](https://zed.dev/).

## How to Set Up GitHub Copilot in Zed

1. Open Zed and navigate to **Settings**.
2. Go to the "GitHub Copilot Chat" section.
3. Click **Sign in to use GitHub Copilot** and follow the authentication prompts.
4. Once authenticated, you can use GitHub Copilot features—such as code suggestions and chat—directly within your Zed workspace.

For additional details, refer to the [Zed Copilot integration documentation](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/llm-providers#github-copilot-chat).

## Who Can Use This Integration?

All users with current paid GitHub Copilot subscriptions—including Pro, Pro+, Business, and Enterprise—can access Copilot in Zed. There is no need for a separate AI license or special agreement; existing credentials are sufficient.

## Join the Conversation

Developers interested in sharing their experiences or having questions answered can visit the [GitHub Community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/185912) for interactive support and feedback.

## Summary

This integration streamlines the workflow for developers who want to leverage AI-assisted coding in a modern, collaborative code editor. The partnership between GitHub and Zed expands the reach of Copilot, making it easier to use in different environments while maintaining a smooth and familiar authentication process.
