# Security Contact Email Setting for Enterprise Incident Notifications

GitHub enterprise administrators can now assign a specific contact email address to receive security incident notifications for their organization.

## Key Points

- **Feature Location:** Accessible by navigating to **Settings** > **Profile** in the enterprise account.
- **Purpose:** This new, optional field lets organizations direct all security communications to a single designated email, rather than defaulting to organization or enterprise admins.
- **Fallback Behavior:** If the field is left blank, notifications will continue to route to the existing admin recipients.
- **Benefits:**
  - Centralizes critical alert destinations
  - Helps ensure prompt awareness of incidents
  - Supports faster, more efficient incident response and organizational workflows

## Who is This For?

- GitHub enterprise owners and administrators looking to improve management of security communications

## How to Enable

1. Log in to your GitHub enterprise account
2. Go to **Settings** > **Profile**
3. Enter your preferred security contact email address
4. Save changes
