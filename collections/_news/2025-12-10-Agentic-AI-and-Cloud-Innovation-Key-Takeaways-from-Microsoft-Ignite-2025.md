# Agentic AI and Cloud Innovation: Key Takeaways from Microsoft Ignite 2025

**Author:** Natalie Wossene

## Overview

Microsoft Ignite 2025 gathered over 20,000 in-person and 200,000 digital attendees to discuss the latest in cloud and AI. This summary focuses on the actionable technical news for developers, data scientists, and IT professionals announced at the event. It covers agentic AI, semantic intelligence, advanced database platforms, DevOps automation, and cloud hardware innovations.

## 1. Claude AI Models in Microsoft Foundry

- **Microsoft Foundry** now features both Claude Sonnet and Opus models alongside GPT, giving developers flexibility to choose the right model for each use case.
- Azure is the first cloud platform to offer seamless access to both Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT models.
- Features such as integrated safety, compliance, and model evaluation tools help optimize AI apps for enterprise needs.

## 3. Azure HorizonDB: Advanced PostgreSQL-as-a-Service

- The preview of **Azure HorizonDB** introduces a managed, Postgres-compatible database optimized for cloud-native and AI workloads.
- Features include:
  - Up to 3x throughput over standard Postgres
  - Auto-scaling storage to 128TB and compute to 3,072 vCores
  - Vector indexing with DiskANN for fast semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Integrated migration support via GitHub Copilot-powered VS Code Extension
- [Sign up for preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/horizondb).

## 4. Azure Copilot: Agentic Cloud Operations

- **Azure Copilot** introduces specialized agents for migration, deployment, observability, optimization, and troubleshooting.
- The migration agent automates infrastructure discovery, generates infrastructure-as-code templates, and accelerates modernization.
- Features deep integration with Azure Portal, CLI, and the new Operations Center, helping IT teams maintain compliance and RBAC.
