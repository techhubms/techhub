# How High-Temperature Superconductors Could Revolutionize Power Delivery in Microsoft Datacenters

As demand for AI and data-intensive cloud computing accelerates, Microsoft is exploring how high-temperature superconductors (HTS) can address the critical need for efficient and sustainable power delivery in datacenters.

## The Value of HTS Technology in Datacenters

- **Lossless Power Transmission:** HTS cables can carry electricity with zero resistance, reducing energy loss and heat and enabling greater transmission distances without voltage drops.
- **Reduced Physical Footprint:** Compared to conventional copper and aluminum, HTS cables are smaller, lighter, and require less space for equivalent or greater power capacity — beneficial for the compact, high-density nature of modern datacenters.
- **AI-Era Power Demands:** With AI workloads increasing instantaneous and sustained power needs, HTS enables power infrastructure to grow without necessitating large substation expansions or limiting deployment density.

## Microsoft’s Approach and Partnerships

- Microsoft is collaborating with technology partners and system integrators (like VEIR) to bring HTS technology from advanced research to practical application in cloud infrastructure.
- Recent prototypes, such as a 3MW superconducting cable and rack-level HTS demonstration, show the feasibility and scalability for production environments.

## Technical and Operational Impacts

- **High-Availability Cooling:** Operating HTS requires sophisticated cooling systems to maintain cryogenic temperatures, an engineering challenge Microsoft is addressing with scalable cooling modules.
- **Dynamic Capacity Scaling:** Next-generation power systems with superconductors can support datacenter expansion and interconnection more rapidly than legacy grid solutions.
- **Grid and Community Benefits:** HTS reduces power losses and can help stabilize the grid, while smaller, underground installations lessen visual and physical impacts on local communities.

## Integration with Other Innovations

- HTS is part of a broader focus that includes advanced cooling (like microfluidics) and next-gen networking (hollow-core fiber) to improve datacenter efficiency across power, thermal, and data transmission domains.
- These advances position Microsoft to support future AI and cloud workloads more sustainably and at greater scale.
