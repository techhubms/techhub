### Business Benefits of Ubuntu on Azure

#### Mission-Critical Workloads

Businesses leveraging Azure for data analytics, engineering simulations, machine learning, and other demanding applications experienced considerable improvements in agility and operational efficiency. The ability to quickly and flexibly scale resources on Azure allowed organizations to respond more rapidly to shifting business needs and to deploy innovations such as generative AI, machine learning, and big data analytics without infrastructure constraints.

> “With Ubuntu on Azure, we’ve unlocked AI adoption. We can scale innovations and experiment with technologies like GenAI, ML, and big data analytics without infrastructure constraints.”

These organizations noted that migrating to Azure enabled more rapid adjustments to Ubuntu environments, minimizing friction and enabling faster development cycles.

#### Security and IT Productivity

Security improvements were prominent among the reported benefits. Azure’s native security tooling—including Microsoft Defender for Cloud—delivers ongoing threat assessment, detection, and actionable guidance. This proactive security stance minimized risks and enabled IT teams to focus on strategic, innovation-driven projects rather than maintenance-heavy tasks.

> “Ubuntu on Azure provides built-in security features such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud... This proactive approach helps us identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.”

Built-in AI services further enhanced operations, letting teams adopt new practices and boost productivity by approximately 25%.

> “We leverage AI and refocus our IT team... Azure AI services enhanced our applications and drove innovation. We’ve shifted IT resources from maintenance to strategic projects, improving productivity by 25%.”

#### Operational Cost Savings

Using Azure’s pay-as-you-go pricing and eliminating most hardware maintenance, organizations saw an average 35% decrease in running Ubuntu workloads over three years, with savings of $6,500 per Azure VM. The study participants further reported a 29% annual reduction in infrastructure costs.

> “Ubuntu on Azure has reduced our direct IT costs by 40%, and it also optimizes our resource allocation, so we have better operational efficiency and staff time savings.”

Azure also supported better data availability and integration with existing IT landscapes, further enhancing business decision-making capabilities.
