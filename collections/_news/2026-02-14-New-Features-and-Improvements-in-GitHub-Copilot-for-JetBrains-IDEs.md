# New Features and Improvements in GitHub Copilot for JetBrains IDEs

**Author: Allison**

This update covers the latest improvements introduced to GitHub Copilot for JetBrains IDEs, focusing on expanded Agent Skills support, user experience enhancements, and various updates to help streamline your development workflow.

## What’s New

### Agent Skills Support in Public Preview

- **Agent Mode** now supports 'skills' in public preview. Skills allow you to customize Copilot for your project workflows and automate routine setup activities.
- You can create custom skills or use those shared by the community, such as from the [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) and [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) repositories.
- **Activation**: Enable Skills in your JetBrains IDE via `Settings > GitHub Copilot > Chat > Agent`.
- For Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscribers, administrators must enable the **Editor Preview Features** policy first. More info is available in [the documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/policies).

### User Experience Enhancements

#### Inline Chat Improvements

- Easily add currently selected code to Copilot Chat as context input.
- Open inline chat directly from the floating code toolbar for quicker interactions.

#### Refined Settings Management

- The Copilot settings page now includes individual toggles for Agent mode, Coding Agent, and Custom Agent.
- Sign-in reminders are shown in settings if you are not authenticated.

#### Additional Usability Improvements

- Smoother file navigation while collapsing or expanding files keeps conversations organized.
- Prompt navigation improved with Home and End keys moving the cursor as expected.
- Redesigned chat and diff interfaces for enhanced readability.

### Quality Improvements

- Upgraded safety checks for file handling tools to reduce errors.
- Increased stability for next edit suggestions.
- Persistent mode settings are now retained after IDE restarts.

## Get Involved

- [Download the latest GitHub Copilot plugin for JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot--your-ai-pair-programmer/versions) and explore the new capabilities.
- Share feedback via in-IDE feedback options or the [Copilot for JetBrains IDEs Feedback Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-intellij-feedback/issues).
