# Repository Dashboard: Find, Search, and Save Queries in Preview

GitHub's new repository dashboard (in preview) aims to make it easier for developers to locate and manage repositories within organizations or across personal projects.

## Key Features

- **Centralized access:** One dashboard for all repositories you have access to.
- **Curated views:** Default filters such as `My contributions`, `My repositories`, `My forks`, and `Adminable by me` help you quickly find relevant repos.
- **Filtering and search:** Filter repositories by visibility, language, organization, and more, then sort results by relevance—weighted according to your recent contributions and activity.
- **Saved custom queries:** Bookmark frequent searches to return instantly to important repository views.
- **Flexible query syntax:** Filter using organization and property combinations. Example: `org:Byte-Sized-Demo props.production:true`.

## Usage

- Access via [github.com/repos](https://github.com/repos), the global repositories icon, or the left-hand navigation.
- Built-in views prioritize the repositories most relevant to your recent work across teams and projects.

## Limitations

- Only activity from the past year counts towards relevance and 'My contributions' view.
- Older repositories (with no recent activity) may require manual search/filtering.
- Relevance includes issue/PR/discussion comments, not just code commits.
- Property filtering must be typed manually for now; auto suggestions are planned for a future release.

## Feedback & Community

Share your experience or suggestions in the [GitHub community discussion](https://gh.io/repos-finder-discussion).

## Conclusion

This dashboard is designed to streamline repository management, reduce friction in finding active projects, and save valuable workflows to accelerate collaboration and team productivity.
