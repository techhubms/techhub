description: "GitHub introduces its repository dashboard in preview, designed to help developers and teams quickly find, organize, and save views of their repositories. This tool aggregates all accessible repositories, supports advanced search and filtering (by language, visibility, organization), and allows saving custom queries for efficient workflow management. Relevance sorting highlights active projects, and curated views such as 'My contributions' and 'Adminable by me' make navigation easier. The dashboard currently only weighs repository activity from the last year and is evolving to further improve search accuracy and property suggestion automation."

# Repository Dashboard: Find, Search, and Save Queries in Preview

GitHub's new repository dashboard (in preview) aims to make it easier for developers to locate and manage repositories within organizations or across personal projects.

## Key Features

- **Centralized access:** One dashboard for all repositories you have access to.
- **Curated views:** Default filters such as `My contributions`, `My repositories`, `My forks`, and `Adminable by me` help you quickly find relevant repos.
- **Filtering and search:** Filter repositories by visibility, language, organization, and more, then sort results by relevance—weighted according to your recent contributions and activity.
- **Saved custom queries:** Bookmark frequent searches to return instantly to important repository views.
- **Flexible query syntax:** Filter using organization and property combinations. Example: `org:Byte-Sized-Demo props.production:true`.

## Usage

- Access via [github.com/repos](https://github.com/repos), the global repositories icon, or the left-hand navigation.
- Built-in views prioritize the repositories most relevant to your recent work across teams and projects.

## Limitations

- Only activity from the past year counts towards relevance and 'My contributions' view.
- Older repositories (with no recent activity) may require manual search/filtering.
- Relevance includes issue/PR/discussion comments, not just code commits.
- Property filtering must be typed manually for now; auto suggestions are planned for a future release.

## Feedback & Community

Share your experience or suggestions in the [GitHub community discussion](https://gh.io/repos-finder-discussion).

## Conclusion

This dashboard is designed to streamline repository management, reduce friction in finding active projects, and save valuable workflows to accelerate collaboration and team productivity.
