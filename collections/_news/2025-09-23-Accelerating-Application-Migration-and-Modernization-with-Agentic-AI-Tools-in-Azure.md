Amanda Silver and Ashish Babbar introduce groundbreaking agentic AI tools, such as GitHub Copilot modernization agents and Azure Migrate AI features, to empower developers and IT teams in rapidly modernizing and migrating applications and databases with Microsoft Azure.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Accelerating Application Migration and Modernization with Agentic AI Tools in Azure

Authored by Amanda Silver and Ashish Babbar, this summary from the Migrate and Modernize Summit showcases Microsoft’s latest AI-driven solutions for transforming legacy apps and accelerating cloud adoption.

## Why Modernization Matters

Modern organizations face significant technical debt—outdated codebases and fragmented infrastructure can limit innovation. Over 37% of application portfolios require modernization today, a challenge exacerbated by complex migration processes.

## The Role of Generative and Agentic AI

Generative and agentic AI solutions are streamlining the modernization journey:

- **GitHub Copilot App Modernization Agents:**
  - Newly available for both **Java** (general release) and **.NET** (public preview).
  - Use autonomous AI agents to analyze app code, spot breaking changes, suggest migration paths, and automate upgrades—including dependency updates and security checks.
  - Automates containerization and deployment artifacts, supporting development, testing, and compliance through Microsoft Azure.
  - Proven impact: Organizations such as Microsoft Teams have reduced modernization effort from months to hours, and Ford China achieved a 70% time savings for middleware modernization.
