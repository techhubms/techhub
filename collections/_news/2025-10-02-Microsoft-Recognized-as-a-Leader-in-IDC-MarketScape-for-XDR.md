# Microsoft Recognized as a Leader in IDC MarketScape for XDR

Microsoft has been named a Leader in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Extended Detection and Response (XDR) Software for 2025, marking a significant achievement in unified security operations.

## Comprehensive Enterprise Visibility

Microsoft Defender XDR delivers comprehensive signal coverage, spanning endpoints, identities, email, SaaS apps, cloud workloads, and data security. This enables security teams to consolidate visibility, automate response, and get ahead of evolving threats through integrated threat detection, prevention, and response features. Backed by AI-powered automation and SIEM integration, Defender XDR promotes proactive defense and outperforms legacy, siloed tools.

## AI Innovation in Modern Security

A key area in which Microsoft stands out is AI innovation. Microsoft Security Copilot, paired with Defender XDR, powers advanced digital assistants and autonomous agents capable of automating tasks such as phishing email triage and attack disruption. These agentic tools can handle thousands of alerts daily and often interrupt active threats within minutes, improving response speed and operational efficiency in security operations centers (SOCs).

Defender XDR’s AI-driven **automatic attack disruption** technology can contain compromised assets and limit lateral movement proactively, reducing the risk and impact of ransomware and other cyberattacks. IDC highlights this AI-driven approach as a competitive differentiator in the vendor assessment.

## Proactive Defense and Threat Hunting

Defender XDR further strengthens security posture through exposure management, attack surface reduction, and built-in script analysis. Security analysts benefit from features like

- **Script Inspection**: Analyze and classify scripts and commands internally, reducing investigation complexity.
- **Threat Hunting with KQL**: Parse telemetry and identify suspicious patterns using Kusto Query Language (KQL) within a guided user interface.

## SIEM and XDR Correlation

A major unique value recognized by IDC is the seamless correlation between Microsoft SIEM and XDR solutions, enabling cross-platform insights without requiring dual deployments. This integration delivers enhanced threat actor analysis, anomaly detection, and unified workflows.

## Key Takeaways from IDC Report

- Microsoft is recognized for product integration, strategy alignment, market reach, and comprehensive security lifecycle coverage.
- Defender XDR features AI-driven defense, attack disruption, and guided automation for SOC teams.
- Microsoft’s breadth as both a cloud provider and security solution vendor facilitates deep insights into complex threats.
