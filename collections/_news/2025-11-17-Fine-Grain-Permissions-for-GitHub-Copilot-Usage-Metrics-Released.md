# Fine-Grain Permissions for GitHub Copilot Usage Metrics Released

GitHub has expanded access to Copilot usage metrics with a new enterprise role:

**Enterprise Role: `View enterprise Copilot metrics`**

## Key Features

- **Copilot Usage Metrics APIs and Dashboard**: These tools provide detailed insights into how Copilot is being used across your organization.

## Getting Started

1. Enable the `Copilot usage metrics` policy under **AI Controls > Copilot**.
2. Assign users the new `View enterprise Copilot metrics` role via **People > Enterprise roles**.
3. Direct users to the **Copilot Usage Metrics APIs and Dashboard** for immediate access to insights.
