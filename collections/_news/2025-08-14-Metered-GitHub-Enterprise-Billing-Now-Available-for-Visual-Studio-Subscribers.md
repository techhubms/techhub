# Metered GitHub Enterprise Billing Now Available for Visual Studio Subscribers

GitHub has introduced an option for customers using the Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise bundle to switch to pay-as-you-go, usage-based billing for GitHub Enterprise (GHE). This change targets organizations needing more flexibility and in-depth administrative controls over license assignments and compliance.

## What's New

- **Metered Billing**: Easily transition to usage-based billing for GHE-only consumption, now with improved, granular view into license usage by type.
- **Enhanced Compliance Auditing**: Automate email-based user matching and manually correct any mismatches, streamlining compliance processes.
- **Automation APIs**: Public APIs enable automation of license assignment and user matching processes. (Contact your account team for access.)

## How it Works

- Users added with an email matching a Visual Studio subscription will not consume a metered license by default.
- Once Visual Studio plus GitHub Enterprise license allocations are full, new users default to metered GHE licensing.
- The updated admin interface supports easy auditing and realignment of user accounts versus Visual Studio subscriptions.

## Availability

- Gradual rollout over the coming days, currently available on github.com, with planned support for data residency regions.
- Subscription-based Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise customers may opt in at their renewal period.
- API access for automating user/license mapping requires enrollment via your account team.
