Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, announces an industry milestone with Azure and NVIDIA achieving 1.1 million tokens/sec on a single rack—setting a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and cloud performance.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Azure and NVIDIA Set Industry Record: 1.1M Tokens/sec on ND GB300 v Rack

**Author:** Satya Nadella (announced via LinkedIn)

Microsoft Azure and NVIDIA have reached a significant milestone: delivering 1.1 million tokens per second using just one rack of ND GB300 v GPUs in the Azure fleet. This achievement is noted as an industry record and is the result of a sustained engineering partnership between the two companies.

## Key Highlights

- **Industry Record Performance:**
  - Achieved 1.1 million tokens/sec throughput with Azure ND GB300 v GPUs, demonstrating extremely high compute density and AI throughput.
  - Enables new possibilities for running large AI and language models at production scale.

- **Hardware-Software Collaboration:**
  - The accomplishment is a joint effort, leveraging NVIDIA's specialized hardware and Microsoft's extensive experience in running large-scale, cloud-based AI infrastructure.
  - The abstracted boundaries between model optimization and infrastructure design are further diminishing, enabling more efficient deployment of advanced AI workloads.

- **AI Infrastructure Innovation:**
  - This milestone signals a new era in AI performance engineering, where compute density, memory hierarchy, and innovative networking fabric jointly support the demands of large-scale AI training and inference.
  - Cross-organization comments recognize the technological implications—pushing the limits of high-performance computing (HPC) in cloud environments.

## Community Acknowledgments

- Industry professionals and AI engineers echoed that this is not simply a performance statistic but reflects a leap in infrastructure, governance, and operational trust for AI at scale.
- Governance, traceability, and responsible AI practices are identified as the next critical frontiers as technical throughput reaches unprecedented levels.
- CTOs and partner organizations cite this as proof of hardware-software synergy and a blueprint for future AI-driven cloud solutions.
