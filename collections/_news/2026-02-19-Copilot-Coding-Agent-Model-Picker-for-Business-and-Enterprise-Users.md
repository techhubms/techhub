Allison presents an update on the Copilot coding agent's model picker feature, now available for Copilot Business and Enterprise users, enabling them to choose specific AI models for delegated coding tasks.<!--excerpt_end-->

# Copilot Coding Agent Model Picker for Business and Enterprise Users

GitHub has expanded the model selection capabilities for the Copilot coding agent, an asynchronous and autonomous agent designed to handle delegated coding tasks in the background. With this agent, users can delegate coding tasks to Copilot, which then operates in its own development environment in the cloud and opens a pull request upon task completion for user review.

**Model Picker Rollout:**

- Previously available to Copilot Pro and Pro+ users, the model selection (model picker) feature is now open to Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise subscribers.
- Users can select AI models when assigning issues to Copilot on github.com or initiating tasks from the agents tab, agents panel, GitHub Mobile, or Raycast launcher.

**Available Models:**

- Auto (automatic selection based on availability and performance)
- Claude Opus 4.5
- Claude Opus 4.6
- Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Claude Sonnet 4.6
- GPT-5.1-Codex-Max
- GPT-5.2-Codex
- GPT-5.3-Codex

If the setting is kept at **Auto**, Copilot chooses the optimal model for speed and load. If the administrator has not enabled specific models, the picker is hidden, defaulting to Claude Sonnet 4.6.

For detailed instructions, refer to [the official GitHub documentation on Copilot coding agent model selection](https://docs.github.com/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-agents/coding-agent/changing-the-ai-model).

**Key Takeaways:**

- Enhanced flexibility for enterprise and business users to select preferred AI models for Copilot coding tasks.
- Expanded platform support for model selection operations.
- Streamlined workflow for autonomous, background code contributions with agent pull requests.
