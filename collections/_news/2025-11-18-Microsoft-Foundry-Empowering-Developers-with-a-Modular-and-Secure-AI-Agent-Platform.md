# Microsoft Foundry: Empowering Developers with a Modular and Secure AI Agent Platform

**By: Asha Sharma**

Microsoft Foundry has quickly evolved into a modular, interoperable, and secure agent platform, reshaping how organizations and developers build, deploy, and manage intelligent AI-driven systems at scale. This update from Microsoft Ignite 2025 presents major advancements in modular agent stacks, integration of new model partners, orchestration tooling, robust security controls, and cloud-edge deployment.

## Highlights and Key Announcements

### 1. Expanded Model Ecosystem

- **Foundry Models** now includes models from Anthropic (Claude family), Cohere, NVIDIA, and more.
- Features a generally available model router, letting developers dynamically select the best-fit AI model per task.
- Developer tier enables accessible model fine-tuning using idle GPU resources.

### 2. Foundry IQ: Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- **Foundry IQ** revolutionizes RAG by offering iterative dynamic reasoning, centralizing workflows, and simplifying orchestration for agents.
- Integrates closely with Azure AI Search and Microsoft Fabric IQ, providing high-quality information retrieval with respect for permissions/data classifications.

### 3. Foundry Agent Service: Production-Grade Agent Management

- Supports hosted single and multi-agent workflows with built-in memory and state management.
- Enables deployment to Microsoft 365 apps and Agent 365 for enterprise-grade scenarios.
- Visual and code-first workflow designers empower developers with flexibility and scalability.

### 4. Foundry Tools: Business Systems and Multimodal Integration

- Provides real-time, secure API and connector access (over 1,400 connectors to business systems like SAP, Salesforce).
- Multimodal capabilities such as document processing, translation, and transcription.
- MCP tools API management allows integration of any function or workflow for agent use.

### 5. Foundry Control Plane: Unified Security, Identity, and Operations

- Centralizes policy, observability, and security with durable identity (Entra Agent ID), integrated Microsoft Defender and Purview protection, and OpenTelemetry support for monitoring.
- Enables continuous red teaming and unified alerting for risks across the agent lifecycle.
- Defender for Cloud and GitHub Advanced Security integration surfaces AI-driven code security improvements directly in developer workflows.

### 6. Foundry Local: Edge AI on Android

- Foundry Local, already present on Windows and Mac, is now previewing on Android.
- Supports offline/edge agent scenarios—real-time inference, privacy-aware computation, and global scalability.

### 7. Managed Instance on Azure App Service

- Lets organizations migrate .NET web apps to scalable, AI-augmented Azure infrastructure with minimal code changes and streamlined operations.

## For Developers: Productivity and Collaboration

- GitHub Agent HQ introduces unified agent management within GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
- Brings together tools for rapid design, testing, monitoring, and improvement of AI-powered systems.
- Copilot Metrics empowers data-driven insights for teams.

## Security, Governance, and Operations

- Unified guardrails across models, agent behaviors, and tool interactions (input/output).
- Real-time policy enforcement and fleet-wide observability.
- Seamless collaboration between development and security teams thanks to new integrations.
