# Copilot-Generated Commit Messages Now Generally Available on GitHub.com

GitHub Copilot has expanded its developer support by launching contextual commit message suggestions as a generally available feature on github.com file changes. Previously in public preview, this enhancement leverages Copilot’s AI capabilities to create concise summaries of your file edits, making the documentation process quick and seamless.

### Feature Overview

- **Contextual Commit Suggestions:** Automatically generate a commit message summarizing code or file changes made through the file editor.
- **Default Fallbacks:** File deletions and empty file additions will retain existing defaults like “Delete FILENAME” and “Add FILENAME.”
- **Availability:** Now available to all users on GitHub Copilot plans, including GitHub Enterprise Cloud with data residency.

### Settings and Controls

- **Individual Users:** Enable or disable this feature via the Copilot-generated commit messages toggle in [GitHub Copilot settings](https://github.com/settings/copilot/features).
- **Enterprises & Organizations:** Manage access through administrator settings. Enterprises opted into public preview features are automatically enrolled in the new commit messaging.
- **Metadata Rulesets:** If commit metadata rulesets are active within your enterprise, default messages will still be used for commits in organization-related files.
