# GitHub Code Quality in Public Preview: Inline Findings and Copilot Fixes

**Author: Allison**

## Overview

GitHub Code Quality is now available in public preview for GitHub Enterprise Cloud and Team. This feature leverages CodeQL-based rules and integrates with Copilot to provide developers with actionable code quality findings, one-click fixes, and comprehensive repository health scoring—streamlining technical debt management.

## Who Is This For?

- Developers and engineering teams seeking instant, context-aware feedback on code quality.
- Teams focused on reducing technical debt and improving maintainability and reliability.

## Key Features

- **One-click enablement:** Quickly activate Code Quality in your GitHub repository's settings.
- **Actionable findings:** Detects maintainability and reliability issues in supported languages: Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, Go, and Ruby.
- **Code reviews in context:** Inline pull request feedback with clear guidance and autofix suggestions, including Copilot-powered recommendations.
- **Quality scores:** Track reliability and maintainability metrics at the repository level, enabling prioritization.
- **Technical debt management:** Group and triage findings, fix when convenient.

## How to Get Started

1. With preview features enabled, go to **Settings > Code quality** in your repository and toggle the feature.
2. Open a pull request in a supported language and review the inline code findings and Copilot fix suggestions.
3. If you lack access, request organization admin activation. [See the documentation for details.](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-quality/how-tos/enable-code-quality?utm_source=changelog-docs-gh-code-quality&utm_medium=changelog&utm_campaign=universe25)

## Roadmap: What's Next

- **Organization-level dashboards** for large-scale quality management.
- **Test coverage metrics** for deeper quality insights.
- **APIs** to automate code quality data retrieval and management.
- **Enhanced Copilot recommendations** during pull requests.

## Availability and Pricing

- Available for GitHub Enterprise Cloud and Team (not for Enterprise Server).
- Free during the public preview period; analysis consumes Actions minutes.
