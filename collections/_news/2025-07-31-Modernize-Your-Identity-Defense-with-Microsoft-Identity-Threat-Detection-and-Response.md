# Modernize Your Identity Defense with Microsoft Identity Threat Detection and Response

By Eric Sachs and Yaron Paryanty

In the shifting digital landscape where organizations must secure both on-premises and cloud resources, identity-based cyberthreats have become increasingly prevalent and complex. Microsoft reported that in 2024, there were over 7,000 password attacks per second and a 146% increase in adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing incidents.

A unified solution for identity threat detection and response (ITDR) is now essential for minimizing security gaps. Microsoft’s ITDR platform integrates identity and security operations, delivering proactive, real-time defense against sophisticated attacks targeting user identities.

Key takeaways:

- **Integrated Operations:** Combines identity management and security monitoring for seamless threat detection and response.
- **Proactive Threat Protection:** Defends against rising attacks like AiTM phishing and password compromise.
- **Operational Benefits for Identity Admins and SOC Analysts:** Enables rapid identification and mitigation of threats, reducing risk posture organization-wide.
