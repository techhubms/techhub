# GitHub Copilot CLI Now in Public Preview

GitHub Copilot CLI brings the capabilities of GitHub Copilot directly to your terminal, providing an AI coding agent that works alongside you in a command-line environment.

## Key Features

- **Terminal-Native Development**: Interact with Copilot without leaving your command line—minimizing context switching.
- **Integrated GitHub Experience**: Manage repositories, issues, and pull requests using natural language, authenticated with your GitHub account.
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Collaboratively build, edit, debug, and refactor code. Copilot CLI can interpret tasks, plan solutions, and execute multi-step processes with your approval.
- **Extensibility with MCP Server**: The agent ships with GitHub's MCP server by default and can use custom MCP servers, allowing developers to extend or customize its behaviors.
- **Control and Transparency**: Preview all actions before anything is run, ensuring full control over operations.

## Getting Started

1. **Install via npm**: Run `npm install -g @github/copilot`.
2. **Authenticate**: Sign in with your GitHub account.
3. **Subscription**: Use with Copilot Pro, Pro+, Business, or Enterprise plans.

## Use Cases

- **Explore Codebases**: Quickly understand unfamiliar code or jumpstart contributions.
- **Implement Features from Issues**: Let the agent help implement features described in GitHub issues.
- **Debugging**: Receive intelligent suggestions and assistance debugging code locally.
