# Levi Strauss & Co. Partners with Microsoft to Develop Next-Gen Superagent

**Summary:**
Levi Strauss & Co. (LS&Co.), a global leader in apparel, is joining forces with Microsoft Corp. to revamp its retail operations using advanced AI and cloud solutions. The collaboration encompasses a range of Microsoft technologies that enable enriched customer experiences, enhanced employee productivity, and secure, cloud-based innovation.

## Key Highlights

- **Modernizing Retail with Microsoft AI and Cloud**: LS&Co. adopts Azure AI Foundry, Copilot Studio, and Semantic Kernel to create a next-generation superagent. This agentic AI approach powers intelligent orchestration, automation, and improved operational workflows, especially through a Teams-integrated orchestrator agent.

- **Copilot-Powered Applications**: The implementation includes Microsoft 365 Copilot (excluded from developer focus), Copilot Studio for agent creation, Surface Copilot+ PCs running Windows 11, and the widespread use of GitHub Copilot by LS&Co.'s developers for quality engineering, release management, and code innovation.

- **Developer and Security Focus**: GitHub Copilot is credited with accelerating LS&Co.'s developer output, while Azure AI and Semantic Kernel provide the foundation for building secure automation agents. Security is further strengthened by adopting a zero trust model, powered by Azure's native tools and policy enforcement.

- **Cloud Transformation**: LS&Co. migrated application workloads from on-premises environments to Azure using Azure Migrate and leveraged Intune for device onboarding and deployment. This reduces IT overhead and supports rapid scaling across global operations.

## Technical Stack and Architecture

- **AI and Orchestration**:
  - Azure AI Foundry
  - Copilot Studio
  - Semantic Kernel
  - Agentic AI architectures
- **Dev Tools & Platforms**:
  - GitHub Copilot for code acceleration and observability
  - Azure for workload migration and hosting
  - Microsoft Intune for device management
  - Microsoft Teams as the conversational entry point
- **Security Measures**:
  - Zero Trust architecture
  - Policy orchestration with AI-driven security agents

## Developer Impact

- LS&Co.'s developers leverage GitHub Copilot for efficient coding, observability tools, and faster release management.
- Migration from on-premises to Azure was streamlined using Azure Migrate, reducing manual intervention and increasing operational agility.

## Endpoint & Device Management

- Company-wide deployment of Microsoft Intune supports zero-touch device onboarding and application deployment.
- Adoption of Microsoft Surface Copilot+ PCs with Windows 11 allows employees to utilize new AI-driven features and improved reliability.

## Security and Compliance

- Security agents built with Semantic Kernel and powered by Azure AI Foundry uphold a zero-trust security framework across the organization.
- Policy orchestration and scalable security solutions help LS&Co. maintain high compliance standards while embracing rapid digital transformation.

## Conclusion

This collaboration illustrates how established brands can drive innovation through deep technical integration with Microsoft's cloud, AI, and developer ecosystems, transforming both the employee and customer experience.
