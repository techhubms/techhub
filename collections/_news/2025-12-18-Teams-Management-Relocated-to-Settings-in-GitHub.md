# Teams Management Relocated to Settings in GitHub

GitHub has introduced a new way to manage Teams by moving all related administrative tasks to a dedicated page in the repository Settings menu. This change is designed to streamline navigation within the GitHub interface and make it easier for users to find key features.

## What’s New

- **Teams no longer in the left-hand menu:** The previous shortcut for Teams in the left-hand navigation has been removed.
- **Dedicated Settings → Teams page:** All team management activities—creating, editing, and removing teams—are now centralized in the 'Settings → Teams' section.
- **Guidance for users:** A dismissible banner will appear for users when they try to access Teams, pointing them to the new location.
- **Video Overview:** [Watch the video demonstration](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/511453379-e653fa7d-27ff-49e5-a605-7ddb17211543.mp4#t=0.001)

## How to Provide Feedback

GitHub is seeking user feedback on these changes. Users are encouraged to join the [community discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/182179) to share thoughts, report issues, or ask questions regarding the new Teams management interface.
