# Next Edit Suggestions (NES) with GitHub Copilot for JetBrains IDEs: Public Preview

GitHub Copilot's Next Edit Suggestions (NES) feature is now available in public preview for JetBrains IDEs. NES enhances your development workflow by extending Copilot’s support from code completions to smartly suggesting real-time edits and improvements for your existing code.

## What’s New with NES

- **Proactive Suggestions:** NES analyzes your ongoing work and provides inline suggestions to improve, update, or fix your code. These can range from minor typo corrections to more complex logic adjustments and variable refactoring.
- **Inline Edit Indicators:** Suggestions appear as subtle indicators directly in your code. Hover over them to review suggested changes, see previews, and apply them instantly.
- **Context-Aware Edits:** NES adapts suggestions based on your editing context, handling everything from single symbol changes to multi-line refactoring.

## Getting Started

1. **Enable NES:** In your JetBrains IDE, open `Settings` → `GitHub Copilot` → `Completions` and check the option to **Enable Next Edit Suggestions (NES)**.
2. **Start Coding:** NES automatically surfaces suggestions as you edit your code; no additional commands are required.
3. **Review and Accept:** Navigate to suggestions using standard keyboard shortcuts. Accept using the Tab key or interact through the IDE’s gutter menu.

## Providing Feedback

Your feedback is valuable for evolving NES. Use the in-product feedback tool or participate in the [GitHub Copilot for JetBrains feedback portal](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-intellij-feedback/issues).

_Disclaimer: The user interface and feature set for NES in public preview may evolve as feedback is incorporated._
