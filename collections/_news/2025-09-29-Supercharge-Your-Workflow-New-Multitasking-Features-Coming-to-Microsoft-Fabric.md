# Supercharge Your Workflow: New Multitasking Features Coming to Microsoft Fabric

Microsoft Fabric is rolling out a slate of multitasking upgrades aimed at improving complex developer workflows. These enhancements create a modern, IDE-like environment for technical users working on analytics, data engineering, and development projects.

## What's New?

- **Horizontal Tabs for Open Items**: Seamlessly switch between notebooks, pipelines, and reports. Tabs clearly display the item's name, type, and which workspace it belongs to for easy orientation.
- **Multiple Active Workspaces**: Work across several workspaces at once. Color coding and numeric labels help differentiate which items belong to which workspace, optimizing context switching and reducing confusion during multitasking.
- **Object Explorer**: This new feature lets you browse and manage all open items across your workspaces from a single structured view. No need to move between pages—stay organized and efficient as you handle multiple tasks.
- **Raised Item Limit**: The previous cap of 10 open items has been lifted, granting greater flexibility for developers and data engineers working on large, multi-resource projects.

## Addressing Developer Needs

These improvements respond directly to community feedback and usability research. Commonly reported pain points included:

- Difficulty distinguishing between items and workspaces
- Excessive clicks to switch context, causing workflow interruptions
- The 10-item limit restricting multitasking capacity
- A user experience that was less intuitive than modern IDEs

With these updates, Fabric aims to better align its design philosophy with what developers expect from advanced technical platforms.

**Note:** These changes only apply to Microsoft Fabric and do not affect Power BI.
