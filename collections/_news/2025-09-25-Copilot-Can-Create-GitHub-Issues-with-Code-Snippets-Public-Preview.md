# Copilot Can Create GitHub Issues with Code Snippets: Public Preview

GitHub has released an enhancement to Copilot for smarter issue creation. Developers using [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot) can now:

- Create issues and ask Copilot to attach code snippets or relevant files automatically.
- Add extra snippets after Copilot’s initial draft.
- Review and edit Copilot’s suggestions before submitting an issue.

## How to Try the Feature

1. Go to [github.com/copilot](https://github.com/copilot).
2. Use prompts such as:
   - “Create an issue for `YOUR-PROMPT-HERE` in `YOUR-ORGANIZATION/YOUR-REPOSITORY` and add relevant code snippets.”

## Tips for Effective Issue Creation

- Snippets are not included by default; prompt Copilot if needed.
- Always double-check the code and files Copilot suggests; human review is important.
- Specify which snippets or files you want for better results.

With this public preview, issue reports can now carry richer technical context, making handoff from bug reporting to implementation smoother and more efficient. This update aims to streamline developer workflows and elevate code quality by integrating actionable examples directly into issues.
