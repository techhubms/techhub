# Upcoming Deprecation of Select GitHub Copilot Models from Claude and OpenAI

GitHub has announced the scheduled deprecation of specific AI models across all GitHub Copilot experiences—including Copilot Chat, inline edits, ask and agent modes, and code completions—effective **February 17, 2026**. The models affected are:

| Model           | Deprecation Date | Suggested Alternative   |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Claude Opus 4.1 | 2026-02-17       | Claude Opus 4.5         |
| GPT-5           | 2026-02-17       | GPT-5.2                 |
| GPT-5-Codex     | 2026-02-17       | GPT-5.1-Codex           |

## What You Need to Do

- **Update Integrations**: Developers should update their workflows and integrations to ensure use of supported models before the announced deprecation date.
- **For Copilot Enterprise Admins**:
  - Enable access to recommended alternative models in Copilot settings' model policy section.
  - Verify model availability by checking your Copilot settings in **VS Code** and on **github.com**. If model policies are enabled correctly, the alternative models will appear in the Copilot Chat model selector.

> No manual action is required to remove deprecated models once the deprecation date passes.

## Support

GitHub Enterprise customers with concerns or questions should contact their account manager for assistance.
