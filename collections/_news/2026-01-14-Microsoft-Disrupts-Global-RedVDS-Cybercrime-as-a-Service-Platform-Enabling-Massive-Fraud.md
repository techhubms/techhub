# Microsoft Disrupts Global RedVDS Cybercrime-as-a-Service Platform Enabling Massive Fraud

Today, Microsoft announced a major legal and technical operation—coordinated with authorities in the US, UK, Germany, and Europol—to disrupt RedVDS, an online cybercrime-as-a-service marketplace responsible for enabling millions in fraud losses worldwide. This operation included seizure of key RedVDS infrastructure and domains, marking a significant development in the effort to dismantle organized networks behind AI-enabled fraud.

## What is RedVDS?

RedVDS operated as a subscription service providing disposable, virtualized computers—often running unlicensed Windows—at low cost for criminal activity. Attackers leveraged these virtual machines to conduct a variety of cybercrimes, including:

- High-volume phishing campaigns
- Hosting of scam infrastructure
- Business Email Compromise (BEC) operations
- Real estate fraud and payment diversion schemes

Generative AI tools amplified the threat by allowing criminals to identify high-value targets rapidly and craft realistic, multimedia scam communications, including face-swapped videos and voice-cloned messages.

## The Scale and Impact

- Over 2,600 RedVDS virtual machines sent an average of one million phishing messages **daily** to Microsoft customers alone.
- Microsoft blocks or flags 600 million cyberattacks per day, but RedVDS's volume allowed some attacks to succeed.
- Since September 2025, RedVDS-facilitated attacks have compromised more than 191,000 organizations across the globe.
- In the US, RedVDS accounted for more than $40 million in reported fraud losses. Victims like H2-Pharma ($7.3M lost) and Gatehouse Dock Condominium Association ($500,000 lost) are co-plaintiffs in Microsoft's legal action.

## Fraud and AI-Enabled Attacks

RedVDS enabled sophisticated business email compromise by allowing attackers to:

- Gain unauthorized account access
- Monitor ongoing conversations
- Launch targeted scams at critical moments, such as wire transfers
- Use AI for deepfake impersonation and realistic phishing content

Sectors impacted include pharmaceuticals, real estate, construction, manufacturing, healthcare, and more.

## The Global Response

Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, in coordination with law enforcement agencies and international partners, dismantled RedVDS’s infrastructure and disrupted related payment networks. This marks the 35th civil action against cybercrime infrastructure by Microsoft, underlining its strategy of targeting not just individual offenders but the platforms that enable cybercrime.

The company urges all individuals and organizations to:

- Use multifactor authentication
- Verify payment requests by secondary channels
- Watch for subtle changes in email addresses
- Keep software up to date
- Report suspicious activity to authorities

## Ongoing Commitment

Microsoft continues to collaborate globally, participating in initiatives like the [National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance](https://www.ncfta.net/) and the [Global Anti-Scam Alliance](https://www.gasa.org/) to tackle the infrastructure sustaining emerging cyber threats.
