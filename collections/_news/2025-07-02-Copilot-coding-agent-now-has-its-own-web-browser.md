In a recent update, Allison highlights that GitHub Copilot's coding agent, now available in public preview, includes built-in web browsing powered by the Playwright MCP server. <!--excerpt_end--> This enhancement enables the Copilot agent to interact directly with the web, allowing developers to automate browser actions and extract relevant information as part of their coding workflow. By embedding Playwright MCP, GitHub Copilot can perform tasks like fetching documentation, testing web applications, or managing web-based resources, all from within the coding assistant. This integration aims to streamline development by providing seamless access to online resources, boosting productivity and enhancing Copilot's utility as an AI-powered coding companion for developers.
