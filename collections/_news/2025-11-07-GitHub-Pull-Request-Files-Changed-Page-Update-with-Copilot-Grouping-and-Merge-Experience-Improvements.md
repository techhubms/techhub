# GitHub Pull Request Files Changed Page Update – November 6

## Batch Suggested Changes

Developers can now batch and apply multiple suggested changes simultaneously on the new pull request 'Files changed' page, streamlining code review. After adding suggestions to a batch, simply commit them together, with a chance to revise the commit message before finalizing.

## Grouping Changes with Copilot

Copilot is now integrated within the pull request process to analyze and organize related changes into logical groups — like refactors, config updates, and test improvements. This helps Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Pro+ users navigate complex reviews. See [details about Copilot grouping](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-grouping-changes-in-a-pull-request-with-copilot-in-public-preview/).

## Collapsible Annotations and Comments

CI-reported errors, warnings, and other annotation messages are now collapsible, allowing for a cleaner code view. Comments may also be minimized, accessible via the settings gear menu, giving reviewers more control over their workspace organization.

## Other Fixes

This update addresses accessibility and quality-of-life issues, including improved commenting on deleted files and merged pull requests.

## Merge Experience Improvements

+ **Draft Conversion:** The option to convert a pull request to draft is now accessible directly from the merge experience.
+ **Optional Status Checks:** Pull requests in a merge queue now display optional checks, providing extra visibility into potential issues without blocking merges.

## Feedback and Further Changes

Users are encouraged to share feedback through the dedicated [discussion channels](https://gh.io/change-group-feedback) for ongoing improvement. Note that features in public preview may change in the future.
