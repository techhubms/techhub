- **Confirm Model Access:** Administrators can verify enabled models in the Copilot Chat model selector in VS Code or on github.com.
- **No Removal Action Required:** Deprecated models will be automatically removed; no manual intervention is needed.
- **Support:** Enterprise customers can contact their account manager for assistance or questions.
