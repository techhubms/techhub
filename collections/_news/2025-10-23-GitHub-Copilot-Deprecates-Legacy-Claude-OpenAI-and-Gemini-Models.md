## What Administrators Need to Do

- **Review Copilot Settings:** Copilot Enterprise administrators should check and adjust model availability via model policies within Copilot settings.
- **Confirm Model Access:** Administrators can verify enabled models in the Copilot Chat model selector in VS Code or on github.com.
- **No Removal Action Required:** Deprecated models will be automatically removed; no manual intervention is needed.
- **Support:** Enterprise customers can contact their account manager for assistance or questions.

## Resources and Feedback

- [Documentation on Supported Copilot Models](https://docs.github.com/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models)
- [GitHub Community – Copilot Conversations](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/copilot-conversations) to share feedback or discuss the changes.

Administrators and users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the new model options and ensure all integrations and workflows are up to date.
