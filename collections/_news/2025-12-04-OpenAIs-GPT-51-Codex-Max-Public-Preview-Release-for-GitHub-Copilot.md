# OpenAI’s GPT-5.1-Codex-Max Public Preview Release for GitHub Copilot

OpenAI’s GPT-5.1-Codex-Max model is now rolling out in public preview for GitHub Copilot, enhancing coding support and AI capabilities for developers.

- Visual Studio Code (chat, ask, edit, agent modes)
- Copilot Chat on github.com
- Copilot Chat on GitHub Mobile (iOS and Android)

Rollout is gradual. If the model does not appear in your environment, check back later as availability expands.
