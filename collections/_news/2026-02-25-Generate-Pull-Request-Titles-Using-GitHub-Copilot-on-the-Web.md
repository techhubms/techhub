# Generate Pull Request Titles Using GitHub Copilot on the Web

GitHub has introduced a new feature powered by GitHub Copilot, allowing users to generate pull request (PR) titles automatically on github.com.

## How It Works

When creating a new pull request or editing an existing PR title on github.com, you'll now see a **GitHub Copilot** button within the PR title input field. By selecting this button, Copilot will analyze the commit messages associated with the PR and suggest a concise, descriptive title.

## Steps to Use the Feature

1. Open or edit a pull request on github.com.
2. Click the GitHub Copilot button in the PR title field.
3. Review the suggested title and accept or modify it as needed.

## Tips for Better Title Suggestions

- **Write clear, descriptive commit messages**: The quality of Copilot's suggestions depends heavily on the clarity of your commit messages.
- **Avoid vague messages**: Short or generic messages such as `WIP` or `fix` without extra context can lead to poor suggestions.
- **Group related changes**: Keeping related changes within the same PR ensures that the title suggestion is relevant and summarizing a single theme.

If the commit messages are unclear or repetitive, Copilot may produce less relevant or helpful PR titles.

## Availability

This feature is now generally available for all pull requests containing commits on github.com.
