# Reduced Pricing for GitHub-Hosted Runners Usage

GitHub has implemented new, lower costs for GitHub-hosted runners as of December 16, 2025. Users will benefit from price reductions up to 39%, depending on the specific runner machines they select. Importantly, the standard usage of hosted runners remains free for public repositories.

## Key Points

- **Up to 39% Price Reduction:** Different runner types receive varying levels of price cuts; consult the [runner pricing documentation](https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing) for specific rates.
- **Free for Public Repositories:** There is no change to the free tier for public repositories.
- **Useful Resources:**
  - [Changelog announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-12-16-coming-soon-simpler-pricing-and-a-better-experience-for-github-actions/)
  - [Runner pricing documentation](https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing)
  - [Actions pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator#actions)
  - [GitHub public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247)

## Impact

- **Private Repository Users:** These users will see the most change, with lower costs potentially available depending on workload and runner selection.
- **Developers and DevOps Teams:** Cheaper runner usage reduces operational costs, especially for teams with automated CI/CD workflows on GitHub Actions.
