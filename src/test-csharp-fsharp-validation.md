## Inline Code References

Use `C#` for object-oriented programming.
Use `F#` for functional programming.

## Combined Text

C#Text should become C# Text (space after # is OK).
F#Programming should become F# Programming (space after # is OK).

But NEVER: C #Text or C # Text (space between C and # is WRONG).
And NEVER: F #Programming or F # Programming (space between F and # is WRONG).

## Lists with C# and F#

- C# supports async/await
- F# supports pattern matching
- Both C# and F# run on .NET
- `C#` in backticks
- `F#` in backticks

## Code Blocks

```csharp
// C# code example
public class Example { }
```

```fsharp
// F# code example
type Example = { Name: string }
```
