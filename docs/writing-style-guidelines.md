# Writing Style Guidelines

This document defines the writing style and tone requirements for all content in the Tech Hub, including documentation, articles, descriptions, and user-facing text.

## Core Writing Principles

### Tone and Voice

- **Down-to-earth and authentic**: Avoid exaggerated language, hype, and marketing buzzwords
- **Professional yet approachable**: Clear and authoritative without being overly formal
- **Direct and honest**: Get to the point without unnecessary embellishment
- **Respectful and inclusive**: Use language that welcomes all readers

### Language Standards

- **Clear, professional English**: Write for international audiences with varying English proficiency
- **Concise and actionable**: Every sentence should serve a purpose
- **Active voice preferred**: "The system processes data" instead of "Data is processed by the system"
- **Consistent terminology**: Use the same terms throughout all documentation (see [Terminology](terminology.md))

### Punctuation and Sentence Flow

- **Prefer flowing sentences**: Create smooth, readable prose that connects ideas naturally
- **Limit em dashes (—)**: Use sparingly for emphasis or to set off important information. When used, maintain consistency throughout the document
- **Minimize semicolons (;)**: Use periods and start new sentences instead. Semicolons can make text feel formal and choppy
- **Reduce parenthetical statements (...)**: Incorporate information into the main sentence flow when possible. Excessive parentheses interrupt reading flow
- **Use commas for clarity**: Connect related ideas with commas and coordinating conjunctions rather than breaking into choppy fragments
- **Maintain consistent punctuation patterns**: If using em dashes for explanatory content in one section, use them consistently for similar content throughout

**Examples:**

✅ **Good flowing sentences**:
> Everything an AI processes—words, images, concepts—gets converted into vectors, which are simply lists of numbers that capture meaning.

❌ **Choppy with mixed punctuation**:
> Everything an AI processes (words, images, concepts) gets converted into vectors. Which are simply lists of numbers; they capture meaning.

## Specific Guidelines for AI Models

### Common AI Writing Patterns to Avoid

- **Generic openings**: Never start with "In today's digital landscape", "In an era of", "In a world where"
- **Transition sentence starters**: Limit sentences beginning with "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally", "However" to one per paragraph maximum
- **Qualification overuse**: Avoid starting sentences with "It's worth noting", "It's important to understand", "It should be mentioned"
- **Abstract positioning**: Don't use phrases like "stands at the forefront", "represents a paradigm shift", "marks a new era"
- **Temporal vagueness**: Avoid "moving at this speed", "continues to move fast", "develops quickly" without specific context
- **Generic trend language**: Replace "clear uptick", "remains a focus", "across the board" with specific facts

### Positive Patterns to Embrace

- **Direct statements**: Start with the main point: "GitHub Copilot suggests code completions" not "GitHub Copilot offers innovative code completion capabilities"
- **Specific benefits**: Use measurable outcomes: "reduces coding time by 30%" not "significantly improves productivity"
- **Active voice**: "The system processes data" not "Data is processed by the system"
- **Human-centered language**: Focus on what users can do, not what technology enables

### Writing Quality Checks for AI

Before finishing any piece of writing, check:

1. **Count transition words**: No more than one "Moreover/Furthermore/Additionally" per paragraph
2. **Scan for buzzwords**: Remove any words from the "avoid" lists above
3. **Check sentence starters**: Vary how sentences begin - avoid repetitive patterns
4. **Verify specificity**: Each claim should be concrete and actionable
5. **Read for flow**: Text should sound natural when read aloud

## What to Avoid

**CRITICAL**: Avoid these types of words and phrases that create hype or overstate importance:

### Exaggerated Language

- **Buzzwords**: "groundbreaking", "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge", "paradigm shift"
- **Superlatives**: "the best", "amazing", "incredible", "the ultimate solution"
- **Marketing speak**: "delve into", "leverage", "synergize", "transformative", "unprecedented"
- **AI-generated tells**: Starting with "In an era", "In a world", excessive use of "fundamentally", "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally" at sentence starts, overuse of "seamlessly", "effortlessly", "streamlined"
- **Impact qualifiers**: "pivotal", "significant", "major", "substantial", "dramatic", "massive"
- **Intensity words**: "breakthrough", "cutting-edge", "world-class", "industry-leading", "paradigm-shifting"
- **Speed and movement clichés**: "move fast", "moving at this speed", "continue to advance rapidly", "develop quickly"
- **Vague growth patterns**: "clear uptick", "clear trend", "obvious shift", "dramatic increase"

### Vague or Generic Language

- **Filler phrases**: "In this article", "In this post", "It's worth noting that", "As we dive into", "Let's explore"
- **Generic adjectives**: "nice", "great", "awesome" without specific context
- **Hedge words**: Excessive use of "basically", "essentially", "obviously", "simply", "just"
- **Redundant expressions**: "future plans", "past history", "final conclusion"
- **Transition overuse**: Starting multiple sentences with "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally", "However"
- **Vague trend language**: "remains a focus", "continues to be", "across the board", "with plenty of"
- **Generic emphasis**: "as well", "too", "also" when used excessively for emphasis
- **Unclear quantifiers**: "plenty of practical news", "clear uptick", "obvious trend"
- **Speed qualifiers**: "moving at this speed", "continues to move fast", "develops quickly"
- **Generic conclusions**: "With technology advancing rapidly", "As the industry evolves"

### Technical Jargon Without Context

- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Provide context for acronyms and abbreviations
- Explain concepts before diving into implementation details

## What to Embrace

### Authentic Language

- **Specific examples**: Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- **Practical benefits**: Focus on what users can actually accomplish
- **Real-world context**: Explain how features solve actual problems
- **Honest limitations**: Acknowledge when something has constraints or trade-offs
- **Neutral descriptors**: Use "new", "updated", "improved", "enhanced", "additional", "latest" instead of flashy qualifiers
- **Capability-focused**: Describe what something "enables", "provides", "supports", or "includes" rather than how impressive it is

### Clear Structure

- **Logical flow**: Organize information from general to specific
- **Scannable format**: Use headings, lists, and short paragraphs
- **Action-oriented**: Tell readers what they can do with the information
- **Result-focused**: Explain outcomes and benefits clearly

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Documentation

- **Start with the problem**: Explain what users need to accomplish
- **Provide step-by-step instructions**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Include examples**: Show real code, commands, or configurations
- **Test all instructions**: Verify that examples work as written

### Article Excerpts and Descriptions

- **Lead with value**: Start with the main benefit or key insight
- **Mention the author**: Include author names in excerpts where appropriate
- **Avoid repetition**: Don't repeat the title in different words
- **Set clear expectations**: Help readers understand what they'll learn

### User Interface Text

- **Be helpful**: Guide users toward successful completion
- **Use familiar terms**: Choose words users already understand
- **Provide context**: Explain what will happen when users take actions
- **Be consistent**: Use the same terms for the same concepts throughout the interface

## Quality Checks

### Before Publishing

Ask yourself these questions about your content:

1. **Clarity**: Would someone new to this topic understand it?
2. **Accuracy**: Are all facts and examples correct and current?
3. **Usefulness**: Can readers accomplish something concrete with this information?
4. **Authenticity**: Does this sound like genuine human insight rather than marketing copy?
5. **Respect**: Is the language inclusive and welcoming to all readers?

### Content Review Process

- **Read aloud**: Content should flow naturally when spoken
- **Check for buzzwords**: Remove or replace exaggerated language
- **Verify examples**: Ensure all code, links, and instructions work
- **Test with others**: Have someone else review for clarity and usefulness
