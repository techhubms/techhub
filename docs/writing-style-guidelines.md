# Writing Style Guidelines

This document defines the writing style and tone requirements for all content in the Tech Hub, including documentation, articles, descriptions, and user-facing text.

## Core Writing Principles

### Tone and Voice

- **Down-to-earth and authentic**: Avoid exaggerated language, hype, and marketing buzzwords
- **Professional yet approachable**: Clear and authoritative without being overly formal
- **Direct and honest**: Get to the point without unnecessary embellishment
- **Respectful and inclusive**: Use language that welcomes all readers

### Language Standards

- **Clear, professional English**: Write for international audiences with varying English proficiency
- **Concise and actionable**: Every sentence should serve a purpose
- **Active voice preferred**: "The system processes data" instead of "Data is processed by the system"
- **Consistent terminology**: Use the same terms throughout all documentation (see [Terminology](terminology.md))

## What to Avoid

**CRITICAL**: Avoid these types of words and phrases that create hype or overstate importance:

### Exaggerated Language

- **Buzzwords**: "groundbreaking", "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge", "paradigm shift"
- **Superlatives**: "the best", "amazing", "incredible", "the ultimate solution"
- **Marketing speak**: "delve into", "leverage", "synergize", "transformative", "unprecedented"
- **AI-generated tells**: Starting with "In an era", "In a world", excessive use of "fundamentally"

### Vague or Generic Language

- **Filler phrases**: "In this article", "In this post", "It's worth noting that"
- **Generic adjectives**: "nice", "great", "awesome" without specific context
- **Hedge words**: Excessive use of "basically", "essentially", "obviously"
- **Redundant expressions**: "future plans", "past history", "final conclusion"

### Technical Jargon Without Context

- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Provide context for acronyms and abbreviations
- Explain concepts before diving into implementation details

## What to Embrace

### Authentic Language

- **Specific examples**: Use concrete examples rather than abstract concepts
- **Practical benefits**: Focus on what users can actually accomplish
- **Real-world context**: Explain how features solve actual problems
- **Honest limitations**: Acknowledge when something has constraints or trade-offs

### Clear Structure

- **Logical flow**: Organize information from general to specific
- **Scannable format**: Use headings, lists, and short paragraphs
- **Action-oriented**: Tell readers what they can do with the information
- **Result-focused**: Explain outcomes and benefits clearly

## Content-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Documentation

- **Start with the problem**: Explain what users need to accomplish
- **Provide step-by-step instructions**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Include examples**: Show real code, commands, or configurations
- **Test all instructions**: Verify that examples work as written

### Article Excerpts and Descriptions

- **Lead with value**: Start with the main benefit or key insight
- **Mention the author**: Include author names in excerpts where appropriate
- **Avoid repetition**: Don't repeat the title in different words
- **Set clear expectations**: Help readers understand what they'll learn

### User Interface Text

- **Be helpful**: Guide users toward successful completion
- **Use familiar terms**: Choose words users already understand
- **Provide context**: Explain what will happen when users take actions
- **Be consistent**: Use the same terms for the same concepts throughout the interface

## Quality Checks

### Before Publishing

Ask yourself these questions about your content:

1. **Clarity**: Would someone new to this topic understand it?
2. **Accuracy**: Are all facts and examples correct and current?
3. **Usefulness**: Can readers accomplish something concrete with this information?
4. **Authenticity**: Does this sound like genuine human insight rather than marketing copy?
5. **Respect**: Is the language inclusive and welcoming to all readers?

### Content Review Process

- **Read aloud**: Content should flow naturally when spoken
- **Check for buzzwords**: Remove or replace exaggerated language
- **Verify examples**: Ensure all code, links, and instructions work
- **Test with others**: Have someone else review for clarity and usefulness

## Examples

### Good vs. Poor Writing

#### ✅ Good: Direct and Helpful

> GitHub Copilot helps developers write code faster by suggesting completions as they type. You can accept suggestions with Tab or modify them to fit your specific needs.

### Content Type Examples

#### Technical Instructions

✅ **Good**:
> To filter content by date, click the "Last 30 days" button. The page will update to show only recent articles without refreshing.

❌ **Poor**:
> Leverage the revolutionary date filtering paradigm to fundamentally transform your content discovery experience through our cutting-edge temporal navigation system.

#### Feature Descriptions

✅ **Good**:
> Tag filters help you find content about specific technologies. Select multiple tags to see articles that cover all your selected topics.
